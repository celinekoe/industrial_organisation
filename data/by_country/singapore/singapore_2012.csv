With four levels of progressions, varied daily workouts and class sizes capped at ten people, everyone gets plenty of personal attention. Training sessions run every 30 minutes, from morning until evening, with over 185 sessions every week. The Ritual franchise is owned and operated by serial entrepreneur, Brad Robinson and Internationally-Certified Fitness Coach, Ian Tan. While based in Singapore, the pair came up with the idea for Ritual in 2012, after Tan led Robinson through an intense 20-minute workout that left him spent and lying on the floor. Immediately Robinson realized Tan’s secret recipe for fitness success—getting fit in just 20 minutes. In 2013 they opened the first of four Ritual Gyms in Singapore and now have additional locations in Spain, Brazil, USA and Zurich. Ritual’s very first location was established in 2013 in Raffles Place. It soon became a hot favourite with fitness enthusiasts alike. With everything provided—from high-quality coaching, to effective and safe workouts plus all the necessary fitness gear, towels and grooming products—clients immensely enjoy just showing up as they are. Shock-absorbent floors allow for exercising barefoot and individual ‘pods’ equipped with their own kettlebells, dumbbells, medicine balls, a suspension trainer and pull-up rings enable a safe and efficient workout. Workouts vary daily in terms of work-to-rest rations, order in which exercises are performed, and overall intensity required. This variety keeps the body guessing and progress never stagnates. More recently, Ritual has made its workouts more accessible with the introduction of the Ritual FIT app. The app offers a daily 20-minute HIIT workout that is customized to your fitness level and available equipment and now includes over 5000 recorded vocal cues, which results in an ultra-personalized and highly-efficient guided workout that can be done from the comfort of home.",Early Stage Venture,2750000,SGD,2060015
