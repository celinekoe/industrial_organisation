OUR HISTORY Started in 1993, The Finder is the longest-running lifestyle content brand for expatriates in Singapore. Back then, it was a free, eight-page classifieds listing created by two British expats who realised the need for trusted business recommendations for fellow foreigners. It grew into a four-colour magazine, which was acquired first by ACP Magazines and again in 2012 by SPH Magazines, a subsidiary of Singapore Press Holdings. In June 2020, The Finder was acquired by global mobility company Moovaz Innovation. TODAY Today, The Finder is the FREE insider’s guide for global locals in Singapore – a respected resource for both readers and partners, thanks to its tailored content and smart solutions. Published quarterly, more than 6,000 of each issue  is distributed around the island in more than 400 popular locations, including cafes, stores, salons, doctors’ offices, schools, service apartments and relocation businesses. Our previous free digital editions can be downloaded via Magzter.com, whereas newer editions from Issue 303 and forward can be read directly on our site. Who makes up our more than 300,000 users? Roughly 71 percent are expatriates, while 29 percent are Singaporeans. Nearly 80 percent of readers earn more than $10,000 a month; 47 percent earn more than $20,000 a month. And the majority, 59 percent, are parents. WHAT WE DO The Finder helps global locals – including expats and internationally minded Singaporeans – “Live Well in Singapore” with content  on this website and in magazine on Health + Wellness, Eat + Drink, Beauty + Grooming, Helper Help, Kids Stuff, Travel, Culture, #sglifehacks and more. In addition, each magazine issue has a themed cover and “Insider’s Guide” on a must-read topic for newcomers. The goal? Make every issue worth saving or sharing, which extends the reach for our valued partners. Even better? The Finder puts out handy guides. Each year, it publishes The Finder Directory, full of essential information and business listings for the coming year. The Finder Kids – a mini-mag just for expecting expats, new parents and families of school-aged children – comes out bi-annually. These supplements are distributed free with the main magazine.",M&A,,USD,
