EpicDewan,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/epicdewan,Software,"Petaling Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia",EpicDewan is a SaaS platform that exist to empower associations and societies around the world to bring people together.,"441,593",Active,2023-01-01,day,,,,,For Profit,https://epicdewan.com/,"At EpicDewan, our name says it all. “Epic” stands for greatness, while “Dewan” translates to hall. Together, EpicDewan signifies more than just words; it’s a commitment to empower associations and societies globally, fostering connections and orchestrating activities that elevate members to greater heights in both their lives and careers.  It’s a catalyst for bringing people together. Designed as an association and society member management system, EpicDewan is on a journey to revolutionize the way groups connect and grow. Our vision extends even further: envision associations equipped with eCommerce capabilities, seamlessly organizing paid training programs and monthly gatherings, enriching the lives of their members in profound ways. EpicDewan is not just another software solution; it’s a movement. We’ve crafted a free-to-use Software as a Service (SaaS) platform, finely tuned to enable associations to manage their members with ease. And here’s the twist – we only ask for a small transaction fee when there’s an actual transaction, ensuring that associations only pay when they see real benefits. So, what led us here? A simple observation = countless associations across the country still rely on manual record-keeping and reminders. Picture this: a web of members, each with their unique renewal date, and you have to manually remind them all. It’s a logistical nightmare that drains resources. We realized that we could make a difference. Developing this technology was a massive undertaking, and this led us to where we are today – offering a robust, user-friendly platform. You might wonder why associations can’t build this themselves. The answer is twofold. Firstly, the cost – developing and maintaining such a complex system comes with a hefty price tag. Secondly, many associations are non-governmental organizations, focusing their resources on their core mission. It’s where we step in – shouldering the technology burden, allowing associations to focus on what matters most: their members. Our aspiration is simple yet profound to equip associations and societies with a basic membership management platform that enhances their efficiency. We’ve witnessed the struggle – missed renewal notices, clunky spreadsheets, and the constant worry of sustainability. Our platform steps in as a game-changer. With EpicDewan, associations can streamline their operations, ensuring that collections are smoother, resources are optimized, and their service to members is unwavering. Our foundational offering, the membership management platform, is entirely free. It’s a testament to our commitment to the cause. We want associations to experience the power of technology without any barriers. This core system is designed to strengthen the backbone of associations – their members – so that they can focus on creating impact. We stand shoulder-to-shoulder with associations, aiding their growth, and making their noble goals achievable. As you navigate our platform, you’re not just accessing software; you’re joining a movement to empower associations, to amplify their reach, and to make a difference. In a world where connectivity is key, EpicDewan emerges as the bridge that links associations, societies, and their members. Imagine a world where the administrative load is lightened, where resources are directed towards growth, and where associations can thrive. That’s the world EpicDewan envisions, and that’s the world we are building, one connection at a time. Join us on this journey towards greatness. Embrace the power of technology, the strength of connections, and the promise of a better future for associations and societies worldwide. EpicDewan – where greatness meets the hall, where associations meet empowerment, and where societies unite for a better tomorrow.",,,,
