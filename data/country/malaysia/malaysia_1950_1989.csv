One such facility is the Company's flagship Hamilton Bio Conversion Inc. Thermo Master™ Mark III plant, located in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. The Mark III technology is covered by patents recently granted in the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia with 14 more pending and in the final stages of approval under the Patent Cooperation Treaty protocol for international patents. Thermo Tech™ licenses each plant for the use of its Thermo Master™ technology and also grants master licenses to capable firms, for exclusive territories. Through construction, ownership and operation of its own plants and the efforts of master license holders to construct and operate Thermo Master™ plants elsewhere, the Company has plans to roll out a large number of its unique facilities throughout the world. The Thermo Master™ technology converts organic materials normally designated as wastes suitable only for disposal, into useful end products such as animal feed ingredients and fertilizers. It does so rapidly, in a matter of hours, by employing high temperature aerobic (oxygen loving) microbes. The high temperatures eliminate pathogenic (disease causing) bacteria and other microbes as well as any other noxious inclusions such as insect eggs or larvae. The thermophilic (heat loving) organisms that carry out the process improve the overall nutrient profile of the end product, which is then dried to a stable pellet, easy to handle, transport and use.

It has contractual license agreements with other firms capable of building and operating plants. Finally, Thermo Tech™ has specific service agreements with Planet Earth Operating Services Inc. that support it in the normal conduct of business in North America and elsewhere.
