With its name synonymous to “talk to us”, DOC2US is a mobile application that allows you to talk to a doctor or any healthcare professionals via text chat at any time and from anywhere. Why DOC2US? We often find ourselves desperate for a professional medical practitioner’s advice at a time when it seems most inconvenient. Troublesome symptoms that make us question their severity and if relied solely on the internet, we can almost be certain that it is the bleakest ailment that has struck us. The question that always seem to be lingering on our minds are: How severe is the situation and which doctor should I seek opinion from? However, the idea of braving the weather and traffic, proceeding to find a car park, before joining others in the long queue then finally paying expensive consultation fees just to ask a simple question “What is wrong with me?” is barely worth the effort. Here’s where Doc2Us comes into play – connecting you to a healthcare professional and get advice instantly via a simple platform. DOC2US Team  DOC2US, a Malaysian-based mobile application, is co-founded by a medical doctor, Dr. Raymond Choy, a startup entrepreneur, Jack Lee and a reputable app development company, Agmo Studio Sdn Bhd. Together, they operate DOC2US under a joint venture named Heydoc International Sdn. Bhd. How did the idea come about? The idea of DOC2US came about when Raymond found himself in a position where his friends and family members would often message him to ask about symptoms and health or medical related questions. He was also able to relate to the urge to seek second opinion from medical specialists when his late father was fighting hard against blood cancer (Acute Leukemia). During that difficult time, he wished that he could get reliable advice from professional specialists when his father’s condition changes from time to time. Both scenarios led him to wonder what other people who do not know a doctor personally would do in situations when they need to speak to the right doctor. In his case, there was no better option than to turn up at multiple clinics and hospitals to consult the doctors in order to get the better care for his late father. This was when Raymond realized how useful and important it would be for everyone in the country to be well connected to doctors and healthcare providers and be able to speak to them at any time via smartphones. More About DOC2US With DOC2US, now you can text your preferred doctor and get instant response regardless it is during the daytime or night time or whether you are at work or on your sofa. Without having to travel all the way to see a doctor saves you all the hassle but more importantly it also means that ‘seeing’ a doctor is now more affordable and accessible. On DOC2US, there are a variety of healthcare professionals namely general practitioners, specialists, nutritionists/dieticians and pharmacists that you can choose from.  DOC2US understands that not everyone speaks the same language, hence on the platform, you can select your preferred healthcare professionals of different background and language abilities. Too lazy to type? No worries – You can also send a picture or voice message to your preferred healthcare practitioner. DOC2US has also collaborated with Alpro Pharmacy Group to bring you a more convenient and safer way of prescribing and dispensing experience. Electronic prescription via the platform itself is one of the unique selling points especially for those requiring replenishment of long-term medications. *** “There is a paradigm change of today’s patients’ behaviours ranging from seeking medical information, understanding their own conditions, modifying their lifestyles, tracking their own health to accessing affordable convenient care. It is inevitable that our generation is gradually adopting digital healthcare services for better personalised quality of care. We are here not to replace real world consultation nor diagnosis, but we are here to complement the healthcare ecosystem. Ideally physical medical resources should be saved for those who really need it.” Raymond says. DOC2US is available on both Apple AppStore, Google Play Store and Huawei Gallery AppStore",,,,
