When the company was first established in 2005, Managing Director Haji Burhanuddin and his wife Hajah Ainon targeted to create a simple story that would relate to anyone no matter their age and background. The animation department on the other hand was very eager to showcase their technical skill. So after months of discussion they came to an agreement to produce an adventure story with a Malaysian ‘Kampung‘ background. Thus Les Copaque’s first project “Geng Pengembaraan Bermula” was launched in a ceremony on 11 September 2007, together with a short animated series called “Upin & Ipin” that acted as a supporting role to the movie.  The ideation to produce a short animated series was conceived by Haji Burhanuddin to test the acceptance of 3D animation by Malaysian viewers before releasing “Geng Pengembaraan Bermula”. Since the majority of Malaysians are Muslims, he came out with a plan to create a story about fasting during the month of Ramadhan. Upin & Ipin were chosen as the main cast because they were easy to model and animate; they had no hair (although Upin does have one wiry strand) and possessed the same features. The content and storyline for Upin & Ipin the series was co-written and supervised by Haji Burhanuddin and his wife Hajah Ainon.",,,,
