","486,945",Active,1997-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,https://www.symphony-fp.com.sg/,"Symphony Financial Partners is a leader in Asian equity markets, and an authority on the subtle, challenging Japanese investment ecosystem. Today, Symphony manages approximately $1 billion worth of assets for a wide variety of clients, including pension funds, sovereign wealth entities, endowments, and prominent family offices. Founded in 1997 by David Baran and Kazuhiko Shibata, two highly experienced investors who worked at world-class firms such as Goldman Sachs and Nomura Securities, Symphony Financial Partners leverages its invaluable insights into these environments to create enviable returns for shareholders.  Much of this success stems from Symphony’s unique mindset and strategies. Unlike other investors, Symphony Financial Partners believes in encouraging change and returns through stable, long-lived relationships--rather than cannibalizing assets for a quick return. After all, many Japanese assets are already grossly undervalued. In addition, a 20 percent return in the short-term pales in comparison to a well-planned, well-executed exit years down the road, which can yield earnings that are two or three times the initial investment. Towards that end, the team at Symphony Financial Partners works closely with portfolio companies, building lasting partnerships instead of raiding organizations for profit. As a result, the Symphony team draws on a range of diverse backgrounds and talents, from law to engineering, with an emphasis on global experience and understanding credit and business, instead of focusing solely on equity. Previously, team members have worked in locations across Australia, North America, and Asia, in cities from Hong Kong to Tokyo to Sydney.  Today, Symphony offers several distinct funds, each targeted towards specific segments of the highly diverse Asian stock market. The SFP Value Realization Fund, created in September 2003, is a long-term fund specializing in undervalued Japanese companies; this fund is unique in that it engages deeply with portfolio companies, a prime example of Symphony’s emphasis on long partnerships and carefully planned exits. Launched in 2015, the SFP Japan Special Opportunities Fund is a highly diversified, liquid extension of the Value Realization Fund. Created to capitalize on the Japanese economy’s recent shift towards increasingly active shareholders, the fund invests primarily in undervalued local companies that are receptive to improving business value through embracing change. As with the Value Realization Fund, the Special Opportunities Fund exemplifies Symphony’s stewardship approach, engaging actively with portfolio companies to introduce necessary changes and reap higher returns in the process. Ultimately, the strength of Symphony Financial Partners lies in its distinct approach and deep knowledge of the Japanese financial environment. As experts with firsthand experience in a complex, turbulent market, Symphony prides itself on fostering productive relationships and executing well-timed exits to deliver above-average returns.
