Under Mr. Limâs leadership, the organization grew and has since gained widespread recognition by professionals from both within and outside of the industry over the years.  SCAâs first ever event was held in March 2006 at Bangkok, Thailand. During the day of the event, there were demonstrations on the streets of Bangkok to outstate the prime minister at that time. On the January of the following year, SCA returned to Bangkok for its second event. This time, there was a bombing taking place. Both events have proved that holding events overseas is a huge challenge for SCA due to the unstable political climates that result in unpredictable situations. Hence, events are moved to Singapore and all major SCA events have been held in Singapore since then.  In 2011, it attained its not-for-profit status with the support of many government agencies such as the Economic Development Board (EDB). The not-for-profit organization then went full speed ahead with the goal of becoming the community of choice for the next 2 years. In 2012, SCA, which was previously ran singlehandedly by Mr. Lim, started forming a full-time team. By the end of 2012, the company had 7 employees and a part-time supporting editorial team, each covering different aspects of SCA and play different roles in supporting the president.  Besides the formation of the new team, the company officially took over the publication of the Supply Chain Asia Magazine in December 2012. The magazine was established by Mr. Frank Paul and Mr. Turloch Mooney in 2006 and operated as a separate entity from SCA. In January 2013, SCA publishes its first ever issue of the Supply Chain Asia Magazine with new outlooks and directions.  In the same year (2012), with the support of the Infocomm Development Authority (IDA), SCA launched its very own SC Asia mobile application. This is another big leap forward for SCA as members are now able to view e-copies of the magazine on their smartphones as well as access their portal contents through a comprehensive and user-friendly platform.  On January 24th 2013, the company has officially inducted its Board of Advisors consisting of many senior executives from huge global firms.
