It was founded on the premise of being the leading consumer portal in South and Southeast Asia by providing vast quantities of compelling local language content where little existed previously and by unifying disparate markets with a common portal platform where language is no longer a barrier to communication.  In order to provide vast amounts of content for the portal in each target market, it was first necessary to develop sophisticated machine translation technologies that can translate vast repositories of content, primarily in English, into the various local languages. Asia Online has developed these technologies over the last several years, and they matured to the point of commercial viability about 15 months ago.  Although these technologies enable a number of potential business models, the best and most lucrative is Consumer Portals. The Enterprise Translation business was conceived later and developed as a supplemental revenue stream and as a means to achieve R&D goals using customer funded projects.  The machine translation technologies are ready, the portal technologies are already being deployed, and the time in the market is right. Asia Online has begun the initial phases of the roll-out of its Consumer Portals.  On January 7, 2011, Asia Online launched its Thai language portal with the entire 3.5 million pages of English language Wikipedia translated from English into Thai. A live feed is now in place with new Wikipedia articles and edits to existing articles being translated in near real-time. The website was launched by Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva and ICT Minister Chuti Krairoek in conjunction with support from CAT Telecom as part of the Thai Childrenâ€™s day celebrations. Asia Online has an additional business unit that licenses the translation platform and also offers a SaaS service to the translation industry and enterprises customers with mass translation requirements.

We are getting a name for ourselves in Asia but very hard to cross borders and get noticed in the US. Already managing the biggest networks in the region our next step to grow is to go to the US and Chinese market. We are already in talk with chinese radio stations to launch our services over there (provided we can overcome the technical hurdles without giving away the keys to our business), so we are left with finding a way to the US market.

Enables a new hybrid of low cost devices with a variety of form factors that is cloud driven. No distinction between a mobile and a laptop. They will be connected and have a SIM. (only distinction- that of form factors) Deals with fragmentation of the web and enables a unification of web services. For example, an universal contact list that ties the various presence of an individual on the web along with his mobile. Additionally, the OS is built with a social wrap that enables it to be socially active. Communication will be unified.(blogs, social networks, emails and IMs amongst others.)

JobsTAXI is developed as a newer, more powerful platform that brings the success of Hot Jobs Center( a global recruitment portal, in partnership with Aquent in 2007) to another level. So What Makes JobsTAXI Different? Innovative Features that makes YOUR job search easier. JobsTAXI has revolutionary features that make searching for jobs easier and fun. Live Search allows jobs searches to be open ended. Just type in any keyword and we'll get you a list of jobs that you're looking for, on the very same page. The â€œSaved Searchesâ€ function allows users to save and manage their unique search keywords. There's also an â€œAuto Showâ€ function that allows jobs of a chosen keyword to be shown on your return visit to JobsTAXI. Email updates will also be sent whenever a new job that matches your keyword is posted. We've added the search bar across every jobs posting, so you can search for jobs without leaving the same page. What We Are Not. Unlike other online job portals, there are no categories and unnecessary classifications to organize job postings. JobsTAXI thrives on open ended searches using keywords and tags. This allows a faster search with higher relevancy. We're also much easier to use unlike most jobsites with our uncluttered interface. Every job, like you, is unique. Just type in anything you like and we'll deliver like-minded employers right away. Three Click To Post. One Click To Apply. Employers can get a job posted in three clicks and jobseekers can get to a job in one click. We've spent much time tweaking our system and we've created a workflow for both jobseekers and employers that's simple, quick and very easy to use. The best part is, you don't have to create an account to apply for the jobs.",,,,
