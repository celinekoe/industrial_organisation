Everyone kept telling us . . . if you create a listings site or marketplace full of properties, you can sell that site for billions of pesos (millions of dollars) someday. That’s NOT what we’re here to do. In 2013, they realized that it was a challenge in the Philippines for buyers to find that one home you'll love amongst duplicative listings online, or even worse, fake properties. And, buyers were forced to work with multiple brokers, because they represented multiple listings. A very frustrating experience indeed. So, the following year, they decided to create Hoppler and the Hoppler Associate Network. Hoppler and the Hoppler Associates are a network of professional, trustworthy brokers across the Philippines that are connected through their use of technology. Hoppler’s mobile website and mobile app showcases properties that come from this set of qualified brokers, as well as direct owners, within their controlled network. When you’re inquiry comes in, they hand you over to only ONE broker, that’s it. That ONE broker, which they call a “Hoppler Associate”, will know everything you want to know about your preferred area. And most of all, he or she will coordinate on your behalf with everyone in the process (multiple listings brokers, the owner, the tax man, etc., etc.). That heart-pounding moment of meeting your new home for the first time . . . should not be distracted by the frustrations of the path to get there. Brokers and owners, this way of doing real estate will benefit you too. Hoppler will qualify the buyer for you. Window shoppers won't be allowed to view your windows. Owners, they pair you up with brokers who know about selling a property in your neighborhood. Brokers, they pair you up with buyers who will actually want to buy. They believe this will recreate an experience to enjoy. This is how they want to reshape reality in this business. This is how they want to redefine real estate in the Philippines. Take that first step with us, we're ready. ",,,,

Our Story In 2014, two friends, Kirby Gonzaga and Dwight Santos, took on a challenge – to create solutions for real-world problems using digital. From years of working for different media companies, ad agencies, and publishers, Dwight and Kirby knew well the challenges that these companies encounter online. Frequently, digital was treated as a “budget” way to get results, or as an afterthought, not as a way to solve problems. They wanted to make digital a simpler, and solutions-oriented process that aims to solve problems, not create new ones. With that vision in mind, Kirby and Dwight, joined by a few brave souls, started Thirty One Digital Media Solutions, Inc. In the years since, Thirty One Digital grew from a small 5-man team which started out banner ads and websites, into a group of passionate solutions-finders 40+ strong. Together, they worked on a wide array of projects as they encountered clients with different problems that can be solved creatively through digital. Through analyzing the data and providing real solutions, 31D has made exceptional growth with its relatively young team. Our Culture With the mission of creating genuine digital solutions to real-world client problems, Thirty One Digital fosters a culture of solutions-finding. Instead of finding someone to blame, we deal in solutions, not problems. Thirty One Digital works to create a company culture that gives room for our team members to grow. We want every person on the team to be able to think outside of their role and identify real solutions. By giving them opportunities to be real solutions-finders, we were able to help them find ways to expand their skills, build their own passions, and help out causes that matter.",,,,
