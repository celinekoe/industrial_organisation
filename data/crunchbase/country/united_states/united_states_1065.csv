By using class BTreeMap, an efficient distributed Key/Value store is provided as well. Value Using VelocityDB saves time and money for all software requiring reliable, high performance data persistence. The use of VelocityDB can be hidden from your application user's and doesn't require a team of database administrators (DBA's). Benefits The most important benefit is the flexibility that this database system provides. No other types of database system lets you fine tune your application to the finest details. Using VelocityDB, you can choose the best possible data structures for your application. You can control exactly where you place the data persistently. The placement choice can make a huge difference for performance. With VelocityDB you will have the ultimate tool for persisting data efficiently with unbeatable performance. Unstructured Data can be managed efficiently using VelocityDB. Several of the sample applications provided with the download explore unstructured data. The triangle counter test demonstrates how efficient it is to follow association/relations. In memory, an association in VelocityDB is simply a C# object reference. It can't get any more efficient than that. The Kevin Bacon Numbers sample is another example showing how efficient we can handle unstructured data. A common way to manage unstructured data is to add such data to an inverted index. That way we can efficiently query such data, like if we want to know what store products that match one or more words. The entire Google search mechanism is based on an inverted index. In some of our samples we use inverted indexes, these samples include; TextIndexer and Wikipedia. VelocityDB is extremely scalable; it can handle small applications with small amounts of persistent data as well as applications using trillions of objects up to about an Yottabyte in size per session. Unlimited number of sessions can be used per application. Performance is fantastic, a billion Person object database is quickly created, a little over 1 hour, and can be browsed with the VelocityDbBrowser.","Financial Services, Information Technology, Mobile, Payments, Platforms, Privacy and Security, Software",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

When you're running your business, what stands between you and more profitability & freedom?  A high performing team.  You’ve built your business on long hours, sacrifice, and a lot of trial and error.   Being a business owner can feel a lot like constantly failing forward, an emotional roller coaster.  That’s when burnout and decreasing profitability creeps in. What you need is a simple framework and a trusted advisor who’s been there to show you a better (and more simple way) to build your business. When you are ready to get the exact skills you need to build a strong business foundation with a high performing team and operations to support sustainable (and profitable) growth… ...you know, so you can bring your team to its full potential, have more fun, increase your profit margin, and have more freedom in your business (to GASP take a vacation without worry) as you successfully and sustainably grow/scale… ...please feel free to reach out.   I would love to know more about what is keeping you up at night about your business and how I can help bring some relief, clarity, and life back to your business.  --- Building a high performing team and operations used to be hard for me too. I knew I needed support, but I found hiring and leading to be trickier than I thought it would be in the beginning.   I fumbled forward, made some bad hires and was frustrated.  Finally I said enough was enough.  I rolled up my sleeves, took all I had learned from other experts, took a hard look at my mistakes and said there has to be a better way.  That is how my 7Cs framework was born. Suddenly I had a simple framework that not only WORKED for me, it was duplicatable and worked for every single one of my clients who was also struggling with shoring-up their teams and operations! I now had something that was proven and effective - and it didn’t take years to work! Using my 7Cs method, I have saved my clients collectively over $4.8 million dollars by stopping the financial hemorrhages most business owners have from bad hires, ineffective teams, and inefficient operations.  I have been consulting business owners on this simple framework for over 10 years because most business owners aren’t taught how to create and lead EFFECTIVE teams, especially within a business you created yourself and it’s time for the struggle to stop.   No more flying blind or throwing spaghetti at the wall, nope, no more. With me as your trusted advisor and clarity as our co-captain your business can grow without fear, overwhelm or burnout!
