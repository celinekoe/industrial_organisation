It is re-defining the dining experience by directly connecting chefs to diners, and in the process, creating a more intimate and rewarding experience for everyone around the table.  There’s a monumental shift that has taken place in the home – and more specifically at the dinner table – in the last 50 years. The modern household has begun to evolve as a two-income home, and finding time to whip up a home-cooked meal is becoming nearly impossible. Even where the institution does still exist, traditional dinner conversation is losing out in the battle against our phones, tablets and television screens. The reality is that the family and community experience associated with sitting down at the dinner table is quickly becoming an ideal of the past. Kitchensurfing aims to change all of that. By empowering people to eat together and eat purposefully, its mission is to reinstate the idea of the “dinner table” for the modern household.  Enter: Kitchensurfing Tonight. In a modern world starved for time, the problem of dinner is everyone’s, and Kitchensurfing Tonight is reinventing the dining experience through ease and convenience. For $25 per person, it allows busy couples and families to enjoy the experience of a freshly prepared dinner (in under 30 minutes), from a personal chef they know and trust, in the comfort of their own homes. And at a very competitive price, Kitchensurfing Tonight is the perfect alternative to takeout, for busy families who want to dine together (on plates, not out of boxes) around the table, with a meal that’s delicious and good for them, too.  With four different product offerings, Kitchensurfing has any experience covered. Customers can book a chef same-day for a quick, hassle-free 30-minute meal on a Tuesday night; host a fancy cocktail party for 30 with an in-home, person chef; or plan a fun, interactive cooking experience with a group friends and family.

Professor Siemionow’s research focused on the creation of chimeric cells. This led to the development of Dystrophin Expressing Chimeric (DEC) cell therapy. DECs work by combining a malfunctioning cell of the Duchenne patient with a normal, working cell from a healthy donor. This novel chimeric cell is composed of both the donor and the recipient structures and interacts with the surroundings like a normal cell. This offers a unique advantage and allows the patient's body and immune system to accept the chimeric cell without rejection. In such a way, we have created dystrophin producing cells that can engraft the patient's muscles (such as heart, diaphragm, skeletal muscles) and increase their dystrophin levels. Increased dystrophin levels have been shown to correlate with improved functional outcomes. This technology was developed at the University of Illinois in Chicago.

SoleGATE is the disruptive cyber protection software platform by Solebit, challenging the norms of currently available technologies that rely on slow, costly and mostly outdated, ineffective methods of sandboxing, signatures and behavioral inspection. The solution is powered by DvC™ (data vs. code), a patented, real-time, signature-less engine. DvC assumes that there is no legitimate reason for executable code to be present in any data file. As such, it does not rely on heuristics or behaviors (which are core limitations of competing technologies), and definitively identifies and terminates any instance of malicious code such as hidden CPU instructions,  encrypted and polymorphic payloads, shellcodes and other commands typically buried in data file. DvC also accurately identifies an blocks malicious active content using advanced flow analysis, de-obfuscation techniques and deep content evaluation, to reveal threat intent within any inbound data file covering machine, operating system and application levels, thereby rendering such sandbox evading attacks harmless to the enterprise. Solebit was founded in 2014 by a team of world-class cybersecurity experts, all graduates of the elite technology units in the Israel Defense Forces with years of experience in offensive and defensive security.

This proprietary, in vitro diagnostic format provides a colorimetric readout in minutes, visual to the naked eye, without the need for any reagents, readers, instruments, equipment, or training, providing truly decentralized testing that can enable clinicians to extend the point-of-care and laypeople to self-administer at the point-of-need. Our diagnostics combine highly selective molecular receptors with colorimetric nanomaterial reporters to provide immediate, actionable diagnosis to radically improve patient treatments and outcomes, while greatly reducing costs. Under a grant from the NIH, Chemeleon developed this diagnostic to detect the protein biomarker, beta-2-transferrin, in order to enable healthcare practitioners to immediately identify and treat Cerebrospinal Fluid leaks in surgical, post-op, and clinical settings which leads to a drastic decrease in morbidity (87% reduction in meningitis), length of patient stay (by up to a week) and healthcare costs (around $16,000 per patient). Providing the same level of specificity and selectivity as lab-based tests, but in minutes (not days) with a hand-held, instrument-free diagnostic at a fraction of the cost means that this rapid, simple, and inexpensive diagnostic can revolutionize healthcare from hospitals to resource-deprived regions.
