We allow you to simply share, grow, and join the next big startup. Hevan is for everyone from innovators and investors, to developers and marketers who are looking for someone to compliment them in a business venture.  Upon joining HEVAN and completing your free registration, you will characterize yourself by your greatest attribute that you feel can help a business succeed. This attribute will come to define your personal card and help to efficiently match you up with the people you are looking for and the types of projects that fit you best.  After you have completed registration, you will be taken to your personal card. This card is essentially your profile page by which other users will get to know you and view your bio, qualifications, and previous business experiences. Everything on your profile is customizable, so be sure to keep it updated with the âEdit Menuâ. The easy to use Edit Menu allows you to quickly change your profile picture, update your experiences, list websites, and link business profiles to your account. As soon as your personal card is up-to-date you will want to jump right into exploring all of the great features that HEVAN has to offer. The main navigation on every page allows you to easily begin browsing existing projects and businesses. Projects can be filtered by the category that they fit into, the date that they were created, or by the name of the project or its creator. When you come across an interesting project, be sure to visit the creators profile page and add them to your collection of cards. Adding a user to your collection of cards is the best way to keep track of what your connections are up to and allows you to easily navigate back to their profile or to their active projects. While on a users profile, or âcardâ page, simply use the menu located below the users name in order to add them to your card collection or send them a quick message. You can also use the similarly located navigation on a project page to add it to your âfavorite projectsâ. You can then choose to create your very own project based on a great idea that you have or you can browse existing projects to discover ones that interest you. Each project has its very own forum where users can socially interact and help to evolve their idea into a solid business plan. If you feel you would be a good fit for the business, create a proposal to the project creator to either claim equity in that future business or submit a freelance bid. When youâre ready, HEVAN then creates the business for you. Once all 100% of the equity in the business has been claimed and a $400 start-up fee is paid to HEVAN, we will legally create the business for you.","Community and Lifestyle, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

It can throw your whole life into disarray and make you feel like there is no way out. Like there is no hope. Finding a way to beat your charges has to be your number one priority, which means choosing the right lawyer. How do you do that? Look for someone with the right kind of experience. Obviously you want a Fort Worth criminal defense attorney. Someone who has been practicing law for several years. Brandon Fulghamâs experience goes beyond this though.  One of the main reasons that people choose Fulgham Law Firm to represent them is the fact that he has an uncanny knack at understanding how prosecutors think â because he used to be one. Before becoming a Tarrant County criminal lawyer, he was a Tarrant County prosecutor. His job was to put together solid arguments designed to get people convicted. Now he uses that very knowledge to anticipate and prepare for the strategy that prosecutors are likely to use against his clients.  Look for someone well-respected. Brandon Fulgham has an Avvo rating of 10/10 and is considered a Top Attorney in Criminal Defense. The National Trial Lawyers has named him to both their list of the Top 100 Trial Lawyers and to the Top 40 Under 40. Fort Worth Magazine has named him to their Top 100 Attorneys list. This type of recognition matters because it tells you that Mr. Fulghamâs peers in the legal community believe he is doing an outstanding job. The most important recognition to Brandon Fulgham, though, comes from his clients, who have left glowing reviews of his work all over the web. Look for someone with a winning track record. Ultimately, this is what it comes down to. When your life and your future are on the line, you want someone who has proven they can get the job done. One look at Mr. Fulghamâs track record makes it clear that he knows how to get his clients the best possible outcome and finds ways to get charges dismissed, dropped, or reduced. Of course, there is one more important thing that you absolutely need from your criminal lawyer: experience specific to your situation. Because of this, your best bet is to work with someone who focuses on criminal law in your area, so they possess both the depth and breadth of knowledge you need. Brandon Fulgham has successfully handled all kinds of criminal cases in Texas.",Professional Services,1,Brandon Fulgham,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

SpaceFace is the brain child of visionary Scott Kudler, an attorney with a background in Art.  During his early post-graduate years, Scottâs path crossed with Jim Gaines, a renowned artist.  Their association led to a series of character creations which became the basis for the heroes and villains who populate the SpaceFace universe. He finally gave into his imagination and began his journey to see SpaceFace realized.  He felt the burgeoning fields of gaming, science fiction, education, and excitement were ready to unite into his vision.  Scott knew that he wanted the level of the SpaceFace experience to reach the pinnacle of the competition.  He didnât want to mimic it, but rather take it to new levels. After a lengthy search, Scott chose to enlist the story and gaming talents of David Garber, a writer/producer of childrenâs network TV and an award winner: an international Emmy for best Childrenâs science fiction series, as well multiple accolades for his work starting Saved By The Bell and writing and staffing the long running iconic series, The Power Rangers.  At the time of his joining the SpaceFace team, Garber was working in game development for Disney Interactive on the sequel to Epic Mickey and the Kingdom Hearts franchises. Armed with the overall scope of the legend of SpaceFace, Scott next sought out the video gaming and programming specialists at Symbolic Pictures, specifically their team leader and specialist Andy Kreiser.  Working alongside the Symbolic team who developed projects for the NFL, Hasbro, Mattel and Nickelodeon, Scott and his top-tier team fashioned the engaging challenges and adventures that comprise the SpaceFace world.   The result is an entertaining and engaging experience for players of all levels.  The challenges are enhanced by fresh and unique characters who join forces to save a peaceful planet, which serves as a melting pot for galactic beings of all kinds, from potential annihilation.",,1,Scott Kudler,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
