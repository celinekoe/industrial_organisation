Even long-tenured small-cap CEOs can struggle in this regard; for less experienced small-cap CEOs, it’s often a baptism by fire.  Unfortunately, there is no playbook for small-cap CEOs to follow. Historically, small-cap companies have hired all kinds of different service providers to help them bridge the buy-side divide.  But the guidance is often self-limiting – the advisors have never been institutional investors. Most small-cap CEOs and boards receive little more than educated guesses from advisors about how institutional investors will react to seminal capital markets, corporate finance, and corporate governance choices.

TCA is uniquely suited to provide advice to its clients that they can’t get anywhere else in the small-cap ecosystem.  TCA’s clients don’t get educated guesses; they get clear, actionable answers – from a former small-cap fund manager.",Professional Services,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
