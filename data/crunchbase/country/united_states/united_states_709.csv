This platform allows broadcasters to advertise their events via social networks such us Twitter and Facebook , also, it is integrated with Twilio to send SMS messages worldwide.     This idea was born out of necessity, since there are so many family and friend events in other states and overseas, that I am not able to attend, because of time constrains. Watching in youtube, is not the same as enjoy the moment while it happens.    In order to broadcast a private event, an user would sign up, publish his event in a social network (optional), invite people via email, send SMS to mobile number, with a preset date and time. The invitees will get the invitation via SMS (optional) and email. Once the event is ready to be broadcasted, the broadcaster will open up youkaster app on their mobile phones and broadcast away their events. For a public event, the process is similar without the SMS portion and email invitation, this process is similar to eventbrite.     I own 100% of DevOpstier Inc, the company behind Youkaster, so far I have spend about $25K in developing the application, I have DevOps/Systems Engineering background.
