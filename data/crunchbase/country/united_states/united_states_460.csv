So why should someone use Online Outbox, as opposed to just sending an email through Outlook, or their web-based email? 1. Personalize your customer relations. Studies have shown that people respond better to emails that actually address them via their first name. Online Outbox allows you to capture your subscribers first name, last name, age, salary -- even their shoe size -- when they signup to your mailing list. You can then use these fields in your email to deliver personalized content. 2. Send any type of email communication. Newsletters, special offers, follow-up emails, member notices, customer service announcements, affiliate emails, invitations -- anything! 3. Improve sales and increase revenue. Selling a product or service from your website? Why not use Online Outbox to send a series of follow-up autoresponders to your potential customers after they signup for your newsletter? You could send them a free whitepaper, More Information on your products, or even a ""subscriber-only"" discount. Your imagination and creativity really are the only limits! 4. Build trust with your subscribers. One of the most import steps in the buying process is to establish trust with your visitors. By starting your own weekly or monthly newsletter, you're establishing your website as a credible source of information, which helps your visitors build up their trust in you. 5. Unlimited number of subscribers and lists. Create hundreds or even thousands of mailing lists and either import your existing subscribers or use Online Outbox to automatically create a subscription form for your web site. 6. Create an additional revenue stream. Are you a web designer with multiple clients? How about offering them the ability to build their own mailing list and send out a newsletter? With Online Outbox, you can create user accounts, and ""lock"" each account to a specific mailing list. You can also restrict the tasks that each user can perform. For example, if you don't want one of your clients importing email address, then simply disable it with the click of a button! 7. Complies with email laws. Online Outbox includes powerful permission features, such as double opt-in confirmation and one-click unsubscribe which puts you in control of your email marketing campaign.","Information Technology, Internet Services, Messaging and Telecommunications, Sales and Marketing",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Each project begins with a face-to-face meeting, wherein a representative of the firm meets with the client personally. With each consultation, company representatives listen to the customer’s every concern before giving advice. Restaurant Assets knows fully well that every restaurant owner has a unique vision for their business, which is why the company strives to understand the customer’s goals fully in order to help them realize that vision. By employing an approach that aims to address the customer’s specific needs, Restaurant Assets is able to propose a cost-effective and efficient restaurant design utilizing the most advanced construction processes and the best materials available.  Restaurant Assets and Design has a long track record of successfully completed projects, having renovated many restaurants all over the state of California. The company has also undertaken entire restaurant construction projects from conception to completion. In May 2016, Restaurant Assets completed the construction of Chewy’s Restaurant in Sacramento. Although it was one of the most popular eateries in the area, with a fairly sizable and very loyal clientele, Chewey’s was obviously in dire need of a makeover. Restaurant Assets and Design was the only firm that was deemed capable of doing the job with the degree of professionalism and capability required, and a full renovation of the establishment was underway.  Needless to say, the project was a total success. When completed, the restaurant located in the former IHOP building on Watt and El Camino boasted of a revitalized look and a fresh and stylish interior. Rather than totally reinventing the restaurant, the Restaurant Assets team took inspiration from the previous design, and updated it for a new and upscale clientele. The result was a sleek and contemporary establishment that nevertheless retained the warm and comfortable feel to which longtime customers were accustomed.  The services provided by Restaurant Assets and Design are especially valuable considering that restaurants traditionally have fairly short lifespans. In fact, studies have shown that an estimated 60% to 90% of all restaurants established are destined to close shop within the first year of doing business. Of the remaining restaurants that are able to stay in business past the first year, up to 80% are likely to fail within the next three to five years.  There are many factors that can affect a restaurant’s ability to stay in business, among them location, quality of service, management capability, and the feel and appearance of the place. Most other factors are dependent on the owners’ and managers’ ability to deal with them, but improving the feel and appearance is something that Restaurant Assets and Design can definitely help with. Offering a full range of renovation services, Restaurant Assets can breathe new life into tired, old establishments, making them more appealing to new customers as well as to their existing clientele.  In more ways than one, Restaurant Assets and Design could be seen as providing essential “rescue” solutions to restaurants experiencing flagging operations. By providing fresh perspectives to restaurant owners and implementing perceptible changes to the restaurant itself, the company plays an important role in spurring on restaurants to a period of renewed success and profitability.","Food and Beverage, Professional Services",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
