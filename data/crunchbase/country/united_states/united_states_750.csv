The company started life as a small web development firm in Baltimore, Maryland (USA). Services provided to both nationally known and local clients included full site software and graphic development, Internet site hosting and ongoing support. The initial development work done by the company included minor scripting and static HTML based projects that required strict browser compatibility. Within four months of operation, their first contract for an ecommerce site was landed. After spending too many hours debugging and reprogramming various free scripts for the project, then viewing the either costly or undersized options available for sale on the Internet, a conclusion was reached: An ecommerce software program had to be built by the company for internal use. When the project had completed, the first version of the Kryptronic ecommerce software package had been developed. It functioned very well, but was not easily extended or designer friendly. Four months later, a second version of the codebase was released that made functional enhancements to the first. Several installations for various Kryptronic clients of both versions of the software proved profitable for them. Their clientele was generally satisfied with the software as it functioned as advertised and worked consistently.","Commerce and Shopping, Internet Services, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Computer-vision powered payments Utilizing AI in the payments space has streamlined the functionality of payment technology.  As more consumers shop online and via mobile, facial recognition has been a more recent technology that many see as the future of digital payments.  By using device-vision AI, credit and debit card data can be stored with your facial ID and used to make purchases.   Amazon’s Deeplens technology which enables cameras to check out your grocery items without going through a cashier is one example of this.  While it’s still in development, it’s set to disrupt payment systems. Voice-activated payments Biometric protected payments are now more mainstream as they integrate with most smartphones. But more advancements are aspiring to integrate AI powered smart assistants with voice-recognition technologies. With voice-activated payment technology, smart assistants access your accounts for the transaction. In the future, voice activated payments won’t be hinged on assistants or other biometric securities for verification. As effortless payment leads the way in the digital transformation of financial services,  it won’t take long before these displace the current methods used today.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Commerce and Shopping, Data and Analytics, Financial Services, Science and Engineering, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The Washington D.C.-based think tank was established in 2017 with one primary goal in mind: to provide policymakers, academics, and media professionals with impartial insights and illustrative commentaries on the socioeconomics and geopolitics of the Middle East. In doing so, the Foundation hopes to stimulate productive debate on domestic and foreign politics of key regional state- and non-state entities, as well as shed light on how those political shifts stand to impact the United States.  The Foundation observes developments as they occur across the Middle East; however, it maintains a particular focus on the nations embedded in the Arabian Peninsula: Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. The region and its member countries are currently in the midst of a period of faced-paced change, the social, economic, and political implications of which could drastically impact not only residents of the Middle East, but the global community as a whole. Understanding this, the Arabia Foundation seeks to highlight and spark discussion on potentially significant regional changes, and provide an independent perspective on how these transformations stand to influence life domestic and abroad.  Anyone who keeps tabs on the region understands how invaluable these politically-independent insights can be; coverage of happenings in the Middle East is often opaque at best and limited by a lack of attention and colored by inaccuracies. The Arabia Foundation aims to remedy this lack of clarity and visibility by publishing reports, penning commentaries, generating analyses, and organizing events that both center on regional topics and stimulate productive conversations about current events. The Arabia Foundation has the capability to do so; the collective experience of the organization is considerable, spanning sectors that include but are not limited to finance, diplomacy, international relations, politics, and U.S. foreign policy. The organization's efforts have been fruitful thus far; in its first year of activity, Foundation experts have published op-eds and reports across significant media entities such as Politico, Bloomberg, and Reuters. Ultimately, the organization hopes that in providing these published perspectives, the Arabia Foundation will both serve as an invaluable resource for academics, media professionals, and policy experts who need a more layered and nuanced view into the region and provide a well-rounded, objective perspective on the Middle East to the public at large.   The Arabia Foundation is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization that functions on the generosity of private donations and corporate support.
