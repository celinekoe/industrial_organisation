Since our inception in 1991, our volunteers and donors have help raise more than $60 Million to aid in relief efforts. Today our reach is longer and our drive is stronger, as we focus on domestic and global relief. Natural disasters have severe economic consequences. Over the past thirty years the number of people affected by natural disasters and inflicted catastrophes have more then tripled. These figures have triggered a growing awareness of the potential damage caused by natural hazards. There is still limited focus of their wider economic significance or of the problems posed for development. EDR looks behind the headlines, to examine the short and long-term economic and financial impacts of disasters, and factors that contribute to underlying sensitivities. EDR identifies opportunities for improving the management of hazard risk and disasters as they unfold. Falling revenues and relief expenditure requirements produce severe budgetary pressures, and some of the worst disasters have been compounded by budgetary chaos. As a result, in even the more stable societies, families are separated and displaced, businesses are closed, and vital local organizations are distressed. Since 1991 we have been on the frontlines of domestic crisisâ€™ providing relief to those effected.In addition to domestic disaster relief, EDR offers compassionate services to help the needy, support and comfort for military members and their families, educational programs that promote health and safety, and international relief and development programs.","Health Care, Other, Social Impact",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
