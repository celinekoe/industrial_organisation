This is exactly opposite of the most prudent course of action for any company wanting to turn a profit. Whether your project is for the petrochemical, mining, marine, or power and engineering industries, the components you use will directly affect your bottom line. These industries tend to need components like line valves more than any other. Instead of trying to minimize costs and endanger the success of your project, seek out a valve manufacturer that has a proven record of producing reliable, quality service and products. For any need from CapEx projects, to OEM, MRO and fabrication needs, you should always seek a valve manufacturer that is known for versatility, industry ""know-how"" and the confidence to guarantee their valves. GWC Valve International Knows What Quality Products You Require Valves are most often the smallest components of any job, but they are undoubtedly the most important. This is especially true with industries that deal with natural resources like water, gas and oil. The company that you purchase your valves from should be able to produce quality products for all types of valves. These types include GWC, ball, globe, butterfly, check and gate styles. You cannot ""bypass"" quality component construction. The company that your operation chooses to be its main supplier of industrial valves should have a motto that conveys their reputation and philosophy. ""Never compromise"" is a great motto for a valve manufacturer to operate by. This is especially true if that valve manufacturer has been in business for nearly a century. Imagine the quality products a company like that produces. It has had to adapt, change and innovate with every need the industrialized world has presented.  ""Never compromise"" is the motto of a well-respected American valve manufacturer that is excited to fill your industrial orders for sturdy, reliable valves and line components. This company is based in Bakersfield, California and is competent enough to endure any economic environment and order specification.

A CASP is a new type of ASP that permits Internet-based delivery of a full range of communications services, from voice, to data, to targeted content personalized to IP telephones and Internet appliances. Based in Rochelle Park, NJ with development offices in Petach-Tikva, Israel, congruency has developed a ""next generation,"" true Internet voice networking platform that operates with all broadband access technologies. The system uses an architecture incorporating Voice-over-IP, patent-pending technology, ITU/IETF standards and proprietary methods. The result is high quality, traditional and advanced voice communication services over broadband data networks. The network is designed to work with new Internet telephone appliances such as congruency's own i.Picasso© family of phone appliances -- which allow true IP telephony on the business desktop. These IP appliances have the simplicity, familiarity and feel of traditional telephones, but offer advanced Internet capabilities including the delivery of new and easily-customized communications services. The demand for these devices is expected to grow exponentially. Phillips Infotech predicts that over the next four years, more than 10 million business telephone lines will convert to IP. congruency markets these services to Competitive Local Exchange Carriers (CLECs), Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and Building Local Exchange Carriers (BLECs). Due to rapidly increasing competition within their markets, service providers are being compelled to find ways to enhance their products and services. Most currently, they offer similar low-margin commodity transport services, limiting their revenue-generating opportunities. In addition, service providers suffer from customer churn, due to a market in which all providers sell the same basic services. congruency's Communications Network offers a new world of opportunities for CLECs, ISPs, and BLECs by allowing them to sell a host of new, quality, IP services to their customers, without investing in expensive equipment and resources. Through its advanced services, congruency makes it possible for service providers to easily move from a low-cost transport, or a ""free"" telephony model to a ""value-added services"" business model, permitting them to generate new revenue streams. In addition, new ""value-added"" services permit service providers to build customer loyalty, and significantly reduce customer churn and low-profit margins that now characterize their marketplace. As the leader of CASP, congruency is prepared to meet the future needs of the marketplace for IP voice, data and targeted content.","Hardware, Internet Services",,,,1,Late Stage Venture,10000000,USD,10000000,10000000,USD,10000000,"Vertex Ventures, JAFCO Asia, Giza Venture Capital, The Challenge Fund, Nomura International",1,6,,Private,,,,,,

Outdoor sporlar arasında Dağcılık, kampçılık, dağ bisikleti, kayak, yamaç paraşütü, rafting, dalış vs gibi sporları sayabiliriz. Outdoor sporlarda giyimin amacı vücudu doğru ısıda tutmaya çalışmaktır. Outdoor giysilerin vücudu bu ısıda tutabilmenin yanında bazı temel özelliklere de sahip olmaları gekmektedir. Hafif olması ve az yer kaplaması Teri hızlı atabilmesi ve kolay kuruması Rüzgar ve yağmurdan koruması Rahat ve hareketleri kısıtlayıcı olmaması Giyilip çıkartılmasının kolay olması Doğa spolarında giyim kat kat olacak şekilde yapılmaktadır. Bu sayede üşüdükçe giyinme, sıcakladıkça soyunma şansı olur. Katmanlar İç katman, Orta katman ve Dış katman olarak sınıflandırılır. İç Katman (Temel Kat) İlk giyilen ve tene temas eden katmandır. Sentetik ürünler tercih edilmelidir. Nemi dışarıya atabilmeli ve çabuk kuruyabilmelidir Islakken de izolasyona devam edebilmelidir Esnek ve rahat olmalıdır. Orta Katman (Yalıtım) Vücudun ürettiği sıcaklığı koruyan katmandır.Genellikle polar malzemeler kullanılmaktadır. Polar ürünler; Hafiftirler İyi izolasyon sağlarlarlar Az su tutarlar ve çabuk kururlar Poların yetmediği soğuk yerlerde dolgulu ceketler ya da yelekler kullanılabilir Şapka, bere ve eldvenler ısı yalıtımı için muhakkak kullanılması gereken malzemelerdir.   Dış (Koruyucu) Katman Orta katmanı yağmur, kar ve rüzgar gibi dış etkenlerden koruyan katmandır. Üst dış katmanda koltuk altı fermuarları olması havalandırma için önemlidir.. Alt dış katmanda yandan boydan boya fermuarlı olması hem havalandırmayı, hem de giyip çıkarmayı kolaylaştıracaktır. Dış katmanların su ve rüzgar geçirmemesinin yanında soluyabilmesi çok önemlidir.Dış katmanın dikiş noktalarının içeriden bantlanmış olması gerekmektedir. Çoraplar:Kesinlikle pamuklu olmamalıdırlar. Tercihen sentetik yada yün karışımı çorapları tercih etmelisiniz. Panço:Çanta ile birlikte tüm vücudu içine alabilen bir çeşit yağmurluktur.","Commerce and Shopping, Sports",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Pogbyâ€™s proprietary venue booking engine, venue management tools and planned customized search components meets an untapped need within a multi-billion dollar industry.  Pogby.com will be the premier distribution channel for venues to list and market their availability effectively on line. Initial services enable event planners to view a venueâ€™s availability, configure an event package and book an event space directly from the venueâ€™s site or from a distribution partner site. The base service also offers venues the ability to manage their booking requests, manage their venue spaces and optimize their venue utilization via Pogbyâ€™s proprietary venue space management tools. Next release services will enable planners to search, find, compare and rate venues and will provide planners with proprietary tools to help them manage their events more efficiently. Today, the process of finding and booking a venue for an event is highly fragmented, highly manual and unsecure. Planners use multiple means (e.g., spreadsheets, calendar applications, phone, email, fax and in-person visits) to determine availability, reserve and book event space. Similarly, venue managers spend an enormous amount of time, through multiple, manual means , finalizing an event date, event package (menu, options, etc.) and meeting a clientâ€™s budget requirements  before their space is ever booked. In addition, venue managers do not have an integrated toolset to help them manage their venueâ€™s availability, to organize and respond to inquiries, distribute their product to a global audience, or to enable full transparency of the reservation and booking process in a secure environment. Pogby.com streamlines the fragmented event planning process to a convenient, easy to use, online-software service that results in: reduced time spent on compiling a proposal, increased productivity, and increased client customization for both the venue managers and the planners they support.","Events, Media and Entertainment, Messaging and Telecommunications, Software",1,Josh Gooch,11-50,1,Early Stage Venture,,USD,,,USD,,ARC Angel Fund,,1,,Private,,,,,,
