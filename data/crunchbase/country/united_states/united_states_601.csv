The site was founded in 2004 by computer programming expert Asaf Klibansky and Doron Simovitch, a former online merchant, with the aim of creating a comprehensive portal for shoppers, while offering retailers the fairest deal on the internet for posting their products.  Privately owned and headquartered in Midtown New York City, SortPrice now has partnerships with over 5000 merchants of every size and scope, and serves millions of shoppers each month. SortPrice sets itself apart from others in the competitive comparison search engine industry in a number of ways: Flat-fee pricing: SortPrice offers merchants a flat monthly fee for posting to its site, eliminating the possibility of click fraud that is rampant with the pay-per-click models that are the industry standard.   â€œShop, Drag & Dropâ€: Launched in 2005, the ""Shop, Drag, and Drop"" feature allows the shopper to manage their time and budget efficiently in a safe shopping environment. Users can search and browse products from retailers, then drag and drop product images into a virtual shopping list on the left hand side of the page.  This list is not category specific and the products can then be compared for price, used as wish list/gift registry and/or shared with friends. Certified Merchant Program:  SortPrice.com regularly reviews all its merchant websites to ensure they offer accurate pricing information, secure ordering and payment processing, a variety of shipping methods, and strong customer service.   Merchants who consistently rank high in those areas are recognized with a Certified Merchant seal on their listings. Merchants who receive negative feedback and/or do not abide to Sortpriceâ€™s guidelines are removed from the siteâ€™s database. Facebook Presence:  As e-commerce has expanded into the world of social media, SortPrice.com has led the way.  The company was one of the first to offer merchants a way to sell products directly on their Facebook fan pages when it launched the Merchant Store application in late 2008.  Since then, SortPrice has built custom Facebook stores for more than 1,000 national retailers, making it the largest e-commerce application builder on Facebook.   SortPrice also offers shoppers a Facebook application all to themselves.  Called The Wishlist, it allows users to shop right on Facebook and build a list of products they want, whether it be for a birthday, anniversary or any other special occasion.  This wish list is visible to all of the userâ€™s Facebook friends, who can comment on particular items and indicate which products they like.","Commerce and Shopping, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment",2,"Asaf Klibansky, Doron Simovitch",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Through its campaign approach—incorporating public education, legislative advocacy, and litigation—ERA seeks to assist women and girls throughout a life-long continuum: ensuring equality in their educational experience, combating sex discrimination in the workforce, and advocating for workplaces hospitable to working families. Founded in 1974, ERA has been a pioneer advancing equality in work and schools for hundreds of thousands of women across the country. From ensuring the passage of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act and the Family and Medical Leave Act to arguing seminal gender rights cases before the United States Supreme Court, ERA is known for being the home of visionary leaders, unflinching advocates, and hard-nosed litigators for justice. Real progress has been made in recent decades toward securing equal rights for women in the United States. But women and girls continue to face unfair practices and policies in many workplaces and schools. Women in minimum wage jobs, women of color, and immigrant women are often among the most affected by this discrimination, which comes in many forms.","Other, Professional Services, Social Impact",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Veeto monitors contracts, detects changes, and figures out exactly what those changes mean for consumers.  We also automated the process of getting our users out of breached contracts with no early termination fees. This allows users to keep a finger on the pulse of their contractual life. Our story?   Founder Jon Colgan had three unwanted cell phone contracts and faced $750 in early termination fees. Hesitant to keep paying for horrible service, and unwilling to pay the absurd ETF, he had to come up with a solution. By carefully studying his contract over several months and finding various breaches by his provider, Jon was able to leave his contract without paying a dime. Jon decided consumers needed a way to automate his work, and created Veeto. Why?   All too often consumers are taken advantage of by large corporations who think they're above the law.  Government attempts at enforcing consumer rights laws have been ineffective.  Veeto aims to create a country of David's to fight these Goliaths, by keeping consumers informed and enabling them to act on their rights.  Our goal is to make the industry more competitive and enable meaningful consumer choice.  Together, we can keep large corporations honest.  If Veeto is successful, we will all save money. The Impact We're a young company, and we're trying to score a big win for consumers who are frustrated with the lack of regard for consumer rights in the service industry: -If successful, Veeto's software and model will, for the first time, enable meaningful consumer choice. -Our founders have the right mix of experience, ambition, and subject-matter expertise on this consumer frustration, but we need your support. -All of us at Veeto are consumers just like you and we believe that when carriers fail to keep their end of the bargain, consumers shouldn't have to keep theirs.
