The roots of Team Chrissy go back to the Spring of 2005 when a small group of family and friends gathered together at the MS Walk in Chicago in support of Christina Bober who was newly diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis at the age of 22.  Christina, or “Chrissy” as she likes to be called, now 28, has since gone through many ups and downs, most of the time struggling through normal every day activities as she contends with her affliction. She has been diagnosed with secondary progressive MS and currently has a team of doctors that provide treatment at both the University of Chicago Hospital and the Cleveland Clinic. Throughout her struggle Chrissy has been able to persevere. She successfully completed a Doctor of Pharmacy Degree (PharmD) at Midwestern University in Downers Grove, Illinois in 2009 and currently works at MacNeal Hospital in Berwyn, Illinois as a pharmacist.  Through word of mouth, Team Chrissy has since grown to more than 100 people – family, friends and new acquaintances – each helping in their own way. Through their efforts Team Chrissy has been able to raise over $20,000.00 to benefit the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. This has been accomplished through MS charity walks, participation in MS charity softball tournaments and newly launched in 2010, an annual Team Chrissy Golf Outing.  Team Chrissy has decided to re-focus its efforts in a new direction and in February, 2011, Team Chrissy officially became Team Chrissy, NFP, a not for profit 501(c)(3) foundation. Now Team Chrissy is taking on a different responsibility for MS. This decision was made after seeing the struggles that Chrissy has gone through both physically and financially.","Community and Lifestyle, Health Care, Other, Social Impact",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
