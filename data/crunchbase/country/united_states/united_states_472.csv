SetPlex has incorporated the whole television experience with the modern day platform, combining state-of-the-art technology with the traditional TV feel. We keep the subscribers on familiar ground in terms of channel lists, program guides and menu formats; giving them an amplified version of the TV they are used to, rather than a more complicated one. Through a simple interface the end user can broaden their horizons with thousands of hours of extra content. This certainly comes in handy when you can flick through the normal available channels at any given time and find there is literally nothing to watch, or at least nothing that suits your particular taste. SetPlex provides greater viewing pleasure for subscribers, allowing them to watch programs they would normally miss out on, such as sporting events that would normally be shown either too early in the morning or too late at night for the user to watch (eg title fight boxing, F1 Championship Racing). Even satellite and cable customers will find some programs are “off-limits”, being shown on certain channels to which they don’t have access.

The price of the tokens is also set for growth due to our unique business model, so these rewards will go up in value in the course of time, rather than expire. BitRewards also brings a lot of benefits to the retailers, because they get customers that are more satisfied with the rewards in crypto and become more loyal. A comprehensive loyalty program increases the retailers’ revenue by dozens of percent. The stores are also tapping into the crypto-enthusiasts audience, which is very active and appreciates the attention from the regular businesses. The unique value proposition for the retailers is that BitRewards will offer this valuable and expensive loyalty technology free of charge. They will only have to buy in the open market the BIT tokens to reward their users. The value of such software starts from $200/month, therefore thousands of retailers will be keen to connect to the platform. We can make such a claim, because we operate in the market of rewards and loyalty software for more than 5 years, have more than five hundred clients - online stores and deeply know their needs.
