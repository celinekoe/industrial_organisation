ChimpChange bank accounts provide customers with a more useful bank account than a traditional account provided by incumbent banks, without all the fees. The first benefit of ChimpChange is you can create an account within minutes, without visiting a branch. We conduct full electronic KYC (Know Your Customer) checks as required by the US Patriot Act. After a customer passes through full KYC, we open an account. The account is a bank account in their own name, with an Account Number and Routing Number, a debit MasterCard and their money is insured by the FDIC. You can direct deposit your pay into the account, link one of your other bank accounts to it (like your Chase or Citi account), deposit a check, or load cash into the account at any 7Eleven, Walmart, CVS, Kmart, Walgreens or RiteAid. ChimpChange has a number of useful FinTech tools such as predictive spending technology, and graphical display of transaction history. Each purchase on the MasterCard is auto-categorized into one of 24 spending categories. Transaction history is then displayed graphically, so at a glance customers can see exactly where their money is going, and how spending is tracking in each category compared to previous months. ChimpChange also has a round-up savings account, making saving easier by rounding-up the spare change on each purchase.  ChimpChange MasterCards can be used around the world, including at any ATM. Customers can withdraw money out of ATMs for free at any MoneyPass ATM in the US.
