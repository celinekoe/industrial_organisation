Johnny Fly was founded in 2012 by Johnny Freeman – an ex racecar driver with a love for fashion.  Yes…you just read that correctly. ONE EVENING AT HIS DINING ROOM TABLE ..along with his best friend, Adam Cloninger and his now wife, Tara Masud, Johnny placed out all the pieces to create a pair of wooden sunglasses.  At the time, wooden sunglasses sounded REALLY weird.  Adam and Tara both agreed.  Johnny disagreed.  He was obsessed with sunglasses but struggled to find a good quality pair of sunglasses, in an affordable price range.  He also quickly learned, that all of these sunglasses he owned, we’re created using chemicals and materials that were really harmful to the environment. Wooden sunglasses, crafted to perfection, were his fix to this problem. JOHNNY FLY HAS MADE SUSTAINABILITY OUR PRIMARY FOCUS.  Our eyewear, now including RX, is made entirely of sustainable materials from the Acetate (compressed cotton) frames, to the wooden arms.  In 2015, we complimented our eyewear by adding a line of chemical-free leather bags to our brand.  All of our bags are made from recycled hides and naturally tanned with salt water, bark and sunlight. TODAY, Johnny Fly is still run by Johnny and his wife Tara, along with an amazing team that we like to call “The Fly Fam”.  Our flagship retail store is in the Arts District of our hometown, Charlotte, NC. So, if you’re ever visiting Charlotte, make sure to come say “hi!” to our team and get the chance to touch and feel the quality of our products; if you didn’t believe how great they were already.","Clothing and Apparel, Commerce and Shopping, Consumer Goods, Design, Sustainability",1,John Freeman,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The Company will seek to acquire and manage high quality real estate assets with the intention of providing participating investors with real estate focused investment opportunities that combine income, principal investment growth, and elements of capital preservation. The Fund is managed by Millennium Strategic Investments LLC (“MSI” or the “Fund Manager”), a Virginia company formed in 2007 that specializes in real estate acquisition and management. MWMF is also managed by two highly experienced real estate investing professionals and a board of advisors with a total of 63 years of experience in the Washington D.C. Metro real estate market. The Fund is exclusively focused on creating and maintaining investor wealth in the Washington D.C. metro region through four primary investment strategies: wholesaling, rehabbing, cash flowing on properties retained for rental income and hard money lending. In the long term, MWMF plans to add residential land development projects along with expansion into commercial real estate ventures to its repertoire. The collective experience of the Fund’s management team provides its investors with an advantage over investing individually. This is primarily due to the Fund’s ability to quickly and efficiently address any real estate acquisition and management issues. The Fund is also able to invest with aggregated capital, which greatly enhances its negotiation leverage because it can quickly close on acquisition deals without the typical financing delays encountered with institutional financing options. By investing in a Fund with an experienced and specialized management team, investors are freed from the complexities and time required for individual property ownership. Over the years, their Fund Manager and board of advisors have seen extreme market fluctuations; because of this, the Fund management team is always researching market trends to develop strategies allowing us to mitigate this volatility and reduce negative effects on their investors. This experience has also better positioned the Fund to take advantage of market opportunities presented in times of uncertainty. This proactive approach sets MSI Wealth Management Fund LLC apart from their competition.",Real Estate,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
