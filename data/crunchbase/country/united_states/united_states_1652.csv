The Low Profile Fluid Catalytic Cracker, nicknamed the LP-FCC, is a transformational technology that opens a new era of operational flexibility, making crude oil upgrading at or near the well-site an economical and profitable reality. For over 65 years, large Fluid-bed Catalytic Cracking (FCC) technology has been used in complex refining operations to convert low grade crude oils into more valuable petrochemicals and motor-fuels such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Until now, with only minor improvements, conventional FCC technology has remained relatively unchanged. Our LP-FCC now challenges the status-quo by introducing a new and innovative modular design that cost 60% less to build than a comparable FCC unit. It’s much smaller footprint and multi-reactor process delivers higher operating efficiencies and profit margins, while also providing a clear competitive advantage because of its economical ability to scale down to smaller operations. From an investment standpoint, what sets this particular opportunity apart is that our supply chain of raw materials (crude oil) is in abundance and contractually secured, our LP-FCC production process will be ready once construction is completed, and every drop of product we produce can be sold at top dollar to downstream refineries. In addition, we have the top petroleum engineers and management team in place, the project has been approved by all state and federal regulatory agencies, ground has already been broken and the initial foundation laid.  What more could you ask for in an investment? We invite you to take part in America’s energy boom and join our team and efforts to help bring this technology to the world and our nation to energy independence.","Energy, Natural Resources",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

ITS was one of the first PC-based trucking software companies to offer integration to the then-new satellite tracking offerings of QUALCOMM, offering its QTRACS and Circle of Service products for automating Dispatch. In 1994, the company was bought by Qualcomm, Inc. and managed by their OmniTracs division. In May 1997, Melton reacquired the company, products, and key personnel under the MTI banner.
