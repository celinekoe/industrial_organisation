The site allows users to search for, discover, play and queue video clips in any web browser. Tubeify gives you access to all your favorite songs directly in the browser. Listen, watch videos, create playlists and share with friends at Tubeify.com. Tubeify.com is a completely free online music video streaming service. We are unique in offering a web based music video player that can be accessed at work, at home or anywhere you like without any software installation. Tubeify is an idea from [Tomas Isdal](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/tomas-isdal), that aims to turn YouTube into a decent music player. Among other things, he was annoyed by several issues on YouTube, including the fact that videos stop when you search for another song, that many duplicate clips appear in the search results, and that the playlist has poor functionality. The upside, however, is that YouTube has a huge music archive. Tubeifyâ€:tm:s searching is handled by the Last.fm api, and unlike on YouTube the current track will continue to play while searching. Search results are treated as â€œlazy playlistsâ€ which can be â€œpinnedâ€ to the sidebar for easy access later. Adding songs to playlists and the play queue is also pretty easy with full drag and drop support. Another feature that beats most existing services is that it allows users to share playlists with friends. Playlist links can be shared anywhere â€“ just paste the link on Twitter, Facebook or in an email and your friends will have instant access to it.","Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio",2,"Dan Enstedt, Tomas Isdal",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
