This means a user can only see what was recorded at a particular time frame on each of the installed cameras. Faceter makes video surveillance systems much more capable by adding face recognition technology. Faceter can build a list of office workers, family members, restaurant patrons; generate a report on who was detected and when, in the cameras' scope; find each occurrence of a specific person at a specific location and retrieve specific records from the archive.Faceter can be taught to respond to certain events. For example, the system can send SMS to parents when their child arrives from school, and transmit information to integrated systems via available APIs. It could be a smart house management platform that will send a command to warm up food in the microwave. In the next two years we will make Faceter support protocols for several leading smart house platforms and standard callback APIs.

In December of 1992, the idea for a remote-controlled spotlight was spawned. Jerry parlayed a connection with a design engineer, Al Gebhard, into engineering drawings and eventually a prototype and by late 1993 tooling had been completed. With 18 lights in tow, Jerry set about explaining to buyers across the country what they had been missing prior to the Golight. The task was vast as was the implication; 5000 additional Golights were being manufactured and they needed shelf space. Since then, Golight has set the industry standard in remote-controlled lighting. Their lights are in service around the world lightning the way for everything from MATVs in Afghanistan to snow plows in Alaska. Over the course of the 2+ decades that Golight has been in existence, numerous updates have been made to the original Golight, new technologies have been utilized and new models have been added to the line. However, the commitment to quality and durability that Jerry demanded of his first 18 lights has remained unchanged. Golight’s pledge to their customers is this, they promise to keep an eye on the future and embrace innovation in the lighting industry, to design and manufacture the highest quality products in the marketplace and to stand behind their products with unparalleled warranties and service.",Manufacturing,1,Jerry Gohl,11-50,1,,6700000,USD,6700000,6700000,USD,6700000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

MoneyStack,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/moneystack,"Financial Services, FinTech, Health Care, Personal Finance, Personal Health, Wellness","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States","The financial counseling platform for mental health therapy, starting with gambling addiction.","77,904","Great Lakes, Northeastern US",,Active,2017-03-15,day,,,,,For Profit,https://www.moneystack.com,"Problem - 52% of U.S. adults say that financial issues have a negative impact on their mental health (e.g. anxiety, stress, loss of sleep, depression, etc.) (Bankrate, 2023). The problem is that mental health treatment providers aren't trained or equipped to help clients in financial distress, and yet financial issues must be addressed to help clients feel better. Solution - We make it easy for mental health treatment providers to ""team up"" with vetted financial counselors on our platform so that, together, they can treat individuals who are experiencing psychological distress caused by financial issues.  Benefits - With financial counseling incorporated into mental health treatment, individuals get better sooner, providers reduce churn, and payers lower their overall healthcare costs and risks. Market & MVP - At the intersection of Behavioral Health ($180B) and Financial Advice ($60B), we're starting with Problem Gambling, a rapidly growing issue as more states legalize online gambling and sports betting across the United States. GamFin is our MVP.  Traction - We have 9 state governments as customers, we've booked over $100K in revenue so far in 2023, and we've just secured our first outside investment from a startup accelerator (to be announced publicly in September). Differentiation - (i) Third-party payers pay for financial counseling services that we provide to mental health treatment providers and their clients, which eliminates their out-of-pocket costs  (ii) We use an online community-based approach to acquire, engage, and retain treatment providers, which lowers overall CAC (iii) Our HIPAA-compliant financial counseling platform is the first of its kind, bridging the gap between Behavioral Health treatment and Financial Advice.","Financial Services, Health Care",1,Alex De Marco,1-10,1,Seed,120000,USD,120000,120000,USD,120000,Techstars,1,1,,Private,,,,,,

Located in the small town of Vincenne, Indiana, Vincennes is a university wrapped within a small college, wrapped within a university. Since you get the best of both a small college and large university experience, Vincennes is ideal for those who are looking for an intimate and personalized environment in which to pursue a one, two or four-year degree. Vincennes University admissions require a high school diploma or GED. If you do not have either, contact the admissions office for your options. Academics include over 200 majors offered at Vincennes University in health, sciences, humanities, performing arts and business among others. However, Vincennes University's classes remain small, with an average student-faculty ratio of 15:1. Not only are the classrooms intimate, but college life promises a personal experience as well. For example, all students under age 21 are required to live in one of the six residence halls. Each of the halls features computer labs, kitchens and recreation rooms, promising a socially warm community at ""home"" as well as in the classroom. Over 40 student clubs and a cluster of sororities and fraternities enhance the personalized social experience while helping to develop leadership and other skills. While small, Vincennes is sure to point out that it certainly isn't lacking in quality, academically or culturally. The Red Skelton Performing Arts Center, a recently-built structure that hosts plays and concerts, is one example of how Vincennes continues to expand. The Donald G. Bell Recreational Facility is another recent addition to the campus. Students may also benefit from participating in one of Vincennes' internship, work-study or volunteer opportunities with a variety of local businesses or charitable organizations. In addition to work-study to assist with tuition, there are loans and partial or full scholarships for home-schooled high school students. There are also scholarships based on academic merit. These and other forms of financial aid are available to those who qualify.","Education, Other",2,"Kevin Hills, William Henry Harrison",1-10,4,,,,,10350000,USD,10350000,"U.S. Department of Education, Caterpillar, Lilly Endowment, Internal Revenue Service",4,4,,Private,,,,,,
