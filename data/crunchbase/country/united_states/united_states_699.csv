Following a “hub-and-spoke” model we have built a central holding company from which we will incubate several different yet complimentary subsidiaries each with its own market application and commensurate product and technology focus. The business structure is very much consistent with the original premise of Paratus Diagnostics that a common denominator missing from all diagnostic and biological detection solutions is the lack of a simplified sample preparation solution. The genesis of our company was built on the notion that a universal module could be constructed that would address this gap in the in-vitro diagnostics landscape and enable many different diagnostic applications and assay formats without the need for trained laboratory technicians and equipment while maintaining a common core design and manufacturing structure. We have trademarked this common core as the Paratus SDS®, a low-cost consumable cartridge which can be tailored for a variety of assay formats and biological samples to meet numerous diagnostic needs. While the impetus for the Paratus SDS® was the need for a simplified and highly automated sample preparation solution, each cartridge is capable of performing a completely self-contained assay, enabling a true sample-to-answer solution.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",1,John C.
