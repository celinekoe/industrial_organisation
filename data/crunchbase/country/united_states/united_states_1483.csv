You can choose one or be assigned one. In this capacity, your primary care provider is the doctor who provides access to the other services included in your health plan. Generally, you aren’t permitted to see a specialist or receive physical therapy unless your primary care provider refers you to one. Even if you’re not required to have a primary care provider, having one is still a wise choice.

Specializing in intelligent point-and-click front-end software applications that give GUI functionality to host ""green screens"", their mission is to extend the reach and functionality of host applications through Web-enablement, improved user interfaces, and integration of business information with the Internet, intranets and traditional Windows-based PCs. The ResQNet.com product line is based on their patented proprietary ResQNet technology. ResQNet is a 100% Pure Java applet that provides on-the-fly graphical connectivity to host applications on the Internet and intranets through the use of Java-enabled browsers, like Internet Explorer or Netscape Communicator. ResQ! was developed in the early 1990s to meet user demands to incorporate a modern graphical user interface into legacy applications. CSI Complex Systems Inc. was the first to incorporate ResQ! into Banktrade, their trade finance software. Today, ResQ! and Banktrade can be found in banks across North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia. Recognizing the broad-based appeal of the ResQ! product, ResQNet.com (then known as Advanced Transitions Technologies or AT2) was formed and continued developing ResQ! into ResQ! for Windows, and ResQNet. Todres Yampel is President and Chief Technical Officer of ResQNet.com. He is the inventor of the patented technology on which ResQNet products are based and spearheaded technical development in the Complex Systems Group of companies for over twenty years. ResQNet.com markets its products through VARs and resellers, and through its international representatives around the world. In 1996, Computer Generated Solutions (CGS), the world's largest software vendor to the sewn-products industry, chose ResQ! to provide a GUI for Optima, its flagship product. In April 1998, IBM and ResQNet.com signed two agreements. The first agreement lead to the integration of ResQNet's default GUI into IBM's Host On-Demand connectivity package (beginning with v.3.0). In the second agreement, IBM became a global reseller and service provider of ResQNet for Host On-Demand. With 80% of all business data still residing on Mainframe, AS/400 and iSeries computers, ResQNet.com foresees a bright future by facilitating e-business solutions through the integration of host-based information with other areas of an organization's systems. The latest development in ResQNet integrates data between host systems and desktop applications such as Word and Excel, enabling companies to provide Services On-Demand to their clients, vendors, and employees, thus facilitating the trend toward Web-integrated network computing.","Information Technology, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The Workflow Timeline is a live feed of essential business updates: sales, tasks, client notes, emails, and timecards.  Customer management and employee productivity is improved with visibility to the entire team.  This is necessary for SBOs, as optimizing resources is paramount to success when resources are tight.  AllProWebTools facilitates advanced marketing strategies, transparency of company data, and correlations that provide a clear view of what is and is not working in a marketing strategy. Alternative ERP products are designed for larger businesses and require staff training; their high price limits adoption by small businesses.  Typical usuage of 20 of these point solutions makes comprehensive reporting across these separate solutions very time-consuming. We offer the only Workflow Timeline which incorporates data from all business activities into one solution.  This integration allows us to create more powerful tools to optimize small businesses, reducing costs of time and actual expense. After 12 years in business, early adopter Real-Noni.com saw an increase of sales from $7K/month to over $45K/month in 4 years after switching to AllProWebTools.  This growth came from greater overall efficiency and from our marketing coaching services.  Colour Restoration, an auto restoration company in Loveland, has seen an increase in staff productivity as a result of better time-tracking and reporting.  This resulted in a revenue increase of $60K in 6 months. After 5 years in online sales, LogHomeMaintenanceAndSupply.com saw sales grow from $1K/month to $14K/month in the first 6 months after using AllProWebTools and taking advantage of our productivity tools and marketing coaching services.
