Revelstone Compass helps municipalities of all sizes to make data-driven decisions based on facts, not politics or the status quo.  Compass drives new insights, operational efficiencies, better communication, and improved outcomes for citizens.  Revelstone was founded in 2010 by a small group of software and consulting executives with deep experience working with Fortune 500 companies in performance management.  They recognized that the tools and approaches available to help municipal managers were outdated, and insufficient to overcome the serious challenges facing their local governments to ‘do more with less.’  Inspired by the remarkable results big cities and businesses have had using good data to manage well within resource constraints, they designed Revelstone Compass specifically to bring these expensive capabilities to local governments in an affordable and easy-to-use format.  These goals were achieved by combining best-of-breed capabilities from enterprise software like IBM and Oracle with a cloud-based solution.  They believe that a fundamental transformation in the way cities think, operate, deliver services, and engage with their citizens is underway across America.  They are proud to have participated in the inaugural Code for America accelerator, and continue working with Code for America supporting much-needed data-driven innovations for their communities.","Consumer Electronics, Government and Military, Hardware, Information Technology",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
