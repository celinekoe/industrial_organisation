Pleasant Green Grass was founded by Scott Walker in the community of Pleasant Green Durham, NC.   After graduating from NC State University, Scott studied the science of fertilization, weed control, and the threats regularly used pesticides and other chemicals pose to people, pets and the environment. Scott moved out west to train and work for four years with an organic lawn care company. The experience of working with an established organic lawn care company helped him to combine his study of the science of environmentally friendly lawn care with excellent business practices and knowledge of what customers really want.  Scott created a safe and natural customized program for organic lawn care that avoids the conventional hazardous substances, produces better performing lawns and the best part is that he offers these services at about the same price as conventional “chemical” lawn companies. Scott, and Pleasant Green Grass, has developed proprietary and completely unique fertilization and weed control methods specific to the typical North Carolina clay soil.   After testing the program with strong results and happy customers, Scott returned to the community of Pleasant Green to begin Pleasant Green Grass Organic Lawn Care. Referrals from satisfied customers helped grow the company to one of the largest organic lawn care companies in the state. The current use and abuse of synthetic pesticides by the lawn care industry have been shown to potentially cause cancer, birth defects and pollute our water ways is alarming and in large part unnecessary. The lack of science-based decisions taken by most lawn care programs and lack of knowledge is also problematic. The natural and organic alternative to chemical herbicides and pesticides exists and has been used for generations with excellent results. We take the health and safety of our employees, our customers and their babies, children and families, our pets and wildlife extremely seriously. We are TRULY all-natural and organic (certified organic whenever possible), committed to excellent customer service, getting the job done right and making this world and the North Carolina Triangle region just a little bit healthier and more sustainable. Pleasant Green Grass ONLY uses all-natural and organic products making them safe for babies, children and families, pets and our employees.   Pleasant Green Grass is a company that has grown the right way with good, knowledgeable people.  Our integrity and concern for the environment, and for creating healthy ecosystems, in our lawns and elsewhere is genuine and what keeps us passionate about our work. Scott believes that all employees of Pleasant Green Grass should have the knowledge and training to satisfy our customers. Pleasant Green Grass takes pride in our employees and we work to hire the best possible people. Our technicians are experienced, trained in the use of organic applications and friendly! Scott thinks it’s important to provide a safe and enjoyable atmosphere for all employees and we work hard to do so.

The Macgregor Group,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/the-macgregor-group,"Financial Services, Information Technology","Boston, Massachusetts, United States","Founded in 1991, Macgregor is a premier financial technology provider servicing the global investment community.","1,042,940","Greater Boston Area, East Coast, New England",,Active,1991-01-01,year,2005-07-13,day,,,For Profit,,"Founded in 1991, Macgregor is a premier financial technology provider servicing the global investment community. Macgregor provides financial institutions with the technology infrastructure and applications required to radically improve the speed, accuracy and efficiency of the entire investment process. Macgregor's Order Management Network (OMN), Macgregor XIP, give clients superior connectivity to all necessary internal functions and external organizations required for a seamless trading environment. Macgregor's extended architecture affords its clients and partners the unique efficiencies and power that can only be achieved through a large, diverse and well-connected community of users. Macgregor has an appreciation for the incredible speed with which the value of investment information decreases over time as thousands of people at hundreds of organizations chase the same investment opportunities. They recognize that those firms that are a fraction slower, a little less efficient, or who make the slightest mistakes do not fare well. Sustainable competitive advantage they believe can only be achieved by those organizations that can increase the relative speed by which they acquire, process and act on investment information. They focus our attention on the areas of the investment process where increased speed can have the greatest impact: the front and middle-office. Fundamental to our development approach is an emphasis on optimizing investment operations to improve investment performance, rather than simply minimizing the cost of operations. The cost of not acting fast, they feel, is often greater than the operational costs a firm is trying to save with patient and careful trade implementation methods. They also believe that the investment process can only be as strong as the weakest link and that a solution that can not integrate the pre-trade, trade and post-trade areas of a client's workflow is inferior. And to do that successfully means extending the solution beyond the investment manager's walls to include the brokers, exchanges, custodians, settlement and clearing organizations and a variety of service providers that are all necessary parts of the investment process. In 1993 they introduced the industry's first Windows-based trade order management system, Predator. What was most unique about Predator was that in not only integrated the investment manager's internal portfolio management, compliance, trading and operations areas but also real-time market data and a fully supported network that provided access to brokers and other sources of liquidity. In 1997 they established the industry's first FIX network, and in 1999 acquired Merrin Financial to become the industry's leading provider of trade order management systems. Today, Macgregor counts many of the top investment management firms, brokers and ECNs in the world as its clients. With a pioneering legacy of innovation in the development of technology-based solutions and an unmatched track record of successful system implementations, Macgregor's employees remain dedicated to delivering workflow solutions that improve their client's investment performance.","Financial Services, Information Technology",,,,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
