NATIVE LANGUAGES Most Social Listening tools analyze Sentiment under grammatical and semantic rules associated with the English language. However, Spanish, and other Romance languages ​​use countless contextual elements, making the interpretation of an expression above its literal meaning very challenging. In addition, elements such as sarcasm, ambivalence, double meaning, or implicit mischief are not easily classified by a tool whose operational and internal structure was designed to analyze English content.  Qaptum breaks this barrier, using AI and NLP, associated with regionalized libraries such as Mexican, Argentinian, or Spanglish, makes Qaptum an ideal tool for analyzing content specific to a country or region with a high level of precision. SENTIMENT VS. EMOTIONAL ANALYSIS Sentiment Analysis provides data points limited to reflect only Positive, Negative, and Neutral feelings in a conversation. In contrast, Emotional Analysis examines these sentiments in further detail and interprets them into specific behaviors.  For example, a Negative Sentiment can further be categorized into sad, angry, or skeptical, while a Positive Sentiment can be happy, optimistic, or enthusiastic.  Qaptum’s Emotions Engine, “available in Maximum and other advanced products,” offers an incomparable new dimension in understanding and interpreting the conversation around you.

Efficiency increases productivity and reduces costs which result in greater profitability for doctors and increased affordability for patients. The current lack of standardization in the industry has led to inefficient methods and inconsistent patient outcomes.  A Reviticell Kit will significantly improve upon the status quo by optimizing and standardizing procedures so that any medical professional can conduct a given protocol in the exact same way - like a paint-by-numbers system - thereby minimizing patient risk and limiting doctor liability. A Reviticell Kit’s proprietary platform technology is an essential tool for the regenerative medicine industry because it will meet the unmet need for a standardized system that makes it possible for doctors to perform regenerative medical procedures in a way that is safe, predictable and consistent. The unique correlation of technology and components in Reviticell Kits will result in multiple revenue streams that continue to increase in number and magnitude as medical technologies advance. Regenerative medicine is an industry focused on revolutionary procedures that utilize a patient’s blood or body fat to restore parts of their body that have been damaged by trauma, disease or congenital defects.  Locked within body fat are stem cells – the building blocks of their bodies. Unlocking these powerful cells is the key to the future of Regenerative Medicine and Reviticell Kits will be the means to facilitate their release.

History The PDFfiller platform was originally created in 2007 by Vadim Yasinovsky as a personal tool for a friend who needed to digitally fill a form and wasn’t happy with the services available at the time, particularly the requirement to download and install expensive, specialized software. Over the next few years, the application was given to friends, family, and acquaintances by request, and quickly grew in popularity. As the user base of PDFfiller grew, so did feature requests from its users, and it became apparent that the initial problem Yasinovsky set out to solve affected more than just friends and family. The platform quickly grew from being a simple solution for a few people into a full-fledged company, and PDFfiller was officially incorporated in 2009. As of 2014, PDFfiller has employees in 7 countries around the world, working in product development, engineering, marketing, operations, and 24/7/365 technical support. How It Works  PDFfiller allows users to add documents in PDF, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Powerpoint, or Notepad formats by uploading from a local disk, importing from Dropbox or Google Drive, by emailing their unique PDFfiller email address, or by using the platform’s document search engine containing over 10 million fillable forms.  PDFfiller’s editing tools include: add text, highlight, erase, redact, check or circle items, add shapes, add images, add notes, draw freehand, and add signature. Signatures are powered by the company’s DigiSign technology, and can be added by typing, uploading, photographing with a webcam,  or signing with a mouse, trackpad, or on a mobile device screen. The platform’s document management features also allows users to reorganize, merge or delete document pages. Once completed, documents can be saved locally to a computer, emailed (standard or secure), printed, or eFaxed. The service also offers a share feature with which up to 5 users can collaborate on a document, and a SendToSign feature that allows users to request up digital signatures, which are verified by the company. In 2014, PDFfiller introduced Inbound Fax, an add on service that allows users to claim their own fax number and receive faxed documents directly into their account.  Since its founding, PDFfiller’s user base has expanded 100 fold, 20 fold in the last two years, and averages 2 million users annually with 20,000 forms filled per day. The service’s capabilities have grown from simply allowing users to add text and signatures to offering two dozen editing and sharing features, including the ability to highlight and redact text, add images, and collaborate with multiple users. Despite its growth, the PDFfiller is still focused on solving singular document editing problems for individuals, and strives to save users time and money through powerfully simple features that offer freedom from software and access to documents anywhere, anytime, from any device.","Apps, Information Technology, Internet Services, Mobile, Software",3,"Boris Shakhnovich, Semyon Dukach, Vadim Yasinovsky",51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Carlisle,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/carlisle,"Construction, Manufacturing","Scottsdale, Arizona, United States",Carlisle Companies Incorporated is a diversified global company with a portfolio of businesses focused on the manufacture & distribution.,"170,520","Greater Phoenix Area, Western US",,Active,1917-01-01,year,1978-01-13,day,,,For Profit,http://www.carlisle.com,"Carlisle Companies Incorporated is a diversified global company with a portfolio of businesses focused on the manufacture and distribution of highly engineered products for both original equipment and aftermarket channels.  Carlisle's markets include: commercial roofing, energy, agriculture, mining, construction, aerospace, defense, foodservice, healthcare, sanitary maintenance, transportation, industrial, protective coating and auto refinishing.  Leveraging the Carlisle Operating System (COS) and an entrepreneurial spirit to drive continuous improvement, Carlisle's worldwide team of employees generated $3.5 billion in net sales in 2015. Carlisle Companies Incorporated has a long and proud history which began in 1917, when Charles S. Moomy opened Carlisle Tire and Rubber Company in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, to sell inner tubes to Montgomery Ward and Company. With thirty employees Carlisle Tire and Rubber Company began producing automobile inner tubes. The Company continued to grow and prosper through the 1920s. With the Stock Market crash of 1929 and the beginning of the Depression, Carlisle Tire and Rubber, like most other companies during that era, found itself in a desperate struggle to stay afloat. Near the end of the 1930s, in order to avoid bankruptcy, Moomy turned all of his common and preferred stock over to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia which by then, as the largest shareholder, had control of the Company. The end of the depression and the beginning of World War II forced changes upon the rubber industry. Japan cut off 95% of the natural rubber supply from the East Indies, forcing Carlisle, along with other companies, to seek other sources. In December 1945, Carlisle began to manufacture inner tubes using synthetic rubber. Carlisle Tire and Rubber was purchased by Pharis Tire and Rubber Company in 1943 for $330,000. But significant losses followed and in 1949, the Board of Directors decided to liquidate the company. All Carlisle stock was distributed to the Pharis stockholders and the company was officially renamed Carlisle Corporation. In 1946, Carlisle purchased a company that produced molded friction products that are used on traditional brake shoes and thus began the starting point of what today is Carlisle Brake & Friction. This also ushered in a new phase for Carlisle as they began growing as a diversified manufacturing company. During the 1950s and 1960s, Carlisle continued to acquire a variety of other companies further diversifying their product mix to include insulated wire and cable, which today is known as Carlisle Interconnect Technologies. On June 1, 1960, Carlisle Companies Inc. became a publicly traded company on the NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) with a ticker symbol of “CSL.” By the end of the 1960s, Carlisle was producing aerospace and electronic products, recreational tires, automotive accessories and other divergent products. In the 1970s Carlisle pioneered rubber sheet roofing. Using highly engineered formulation and processing techniques to produce synthetic rubber sheets capable of competing with traditional roofing materials. This established Carlisle as a formidable player in both the new and replacement roof markets. This was the genesis of what today is Carlisle Constructions Materials. In the 1980s Carlisle acquired a company that manufactured compression-molded plastic and melamine dinnerware, and later a company that manufactured foodservice equipment and supplies, which was the beginning of what today is Carlisle FoodService Products. So the beginnings of Carlisle Companies Inc. can be traced to 1917 when the company was dedicated to rubber products for transportation, later to be augmented by the acquisition of several wheel manufacturers in the 1990s to become known as Carlisle Tire & Wheel Company. In 2001, Carlisle purchased a manufacturer of transmission belts for industrial applications and, together with Carlisle Tire & Wheel, Carlisle Transportation Products was formed.  In 2013, Carlisle sold its Transportation Products business. Carlisle’s diversification efforts, both through product line extensions within its core businesses and through acquisitions, has continued to build a strong decentralized company led by entrepreneurial management teams. Carlisle continues to bring innovative product solutions to solve customers’ challenges. The Company’s family of businesses builds market leadership that creates enduring competitive advantage, and thereby add value for shareholders. Carlisle Companies’ worldwide team of employees is focused on continuously improving the value of the Carlisle brand by developing the best products, insuring the highest quality and providing unequaled customer service in the many industries Carlisle’s Companies serve.","Manufacturing, Real Estate",,,10001+,,IPO,,,,,,,,,,19,Public,1978-01-13,,,CSL,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/carlisle-ipo--048077ac,NYSE - New York Stock Exchange

Additionally, we offer inter-dealer institutional fixed income trading services through Fundamental Broker Inter-Dealer (FBI) and operate registered investment advisory subsidiaries. Our firm was ranked among the fastest growing private companies in America by Inc. Magazine from 2010 through 2013. In 1996, then 26-year old Gary Wunderlich coupled his investment banking background with an entrepreneurial vision when he acquired a small broker/dealer in Memphis, Tennessee, and launched Wunderlich Securities. During a time of broad consolidation among the larger, regional investment firms, Wunderlich sought to fill a void with his new venture. Initially, Wunderlich Securities focused only on serving individual investors in the Memphis area. But within two years, the industry took notice and Wunderlich’s Private Client Group welcomed a team of like-minded advisors in Houston, Texas, which became the firm’s first of many branch locations. By 2002, the firm was well-established with 60 experienced financial advisors. Over the next six years, Wunderlich expanded its reach into institutional sales, trading and research with the launch of its Fixed Income division, followed shortly by an Equity Capital Markets division. During this time, the firm’s growth and business model attracted the attention of Coil Investment Group, a Norwegian-based private equity and venture capital firm, which then became a financial partner in 2007. This investment fueled continued expansion for Wunderlich in the years ahead. As the Private Client Group added advisors and new locations in Tennessee and Michigan, the Equity division expanded into investment banking as a result of two banking boutique acquisitions. By 2011, the firm’s equity research effort had grown to 16 analysts following over 200 companies. Considered by this time a full-service financial services firm as a result of a broad offering of individual and institutional services, Wunderlich was recognized by Inc. Magazine as one of the fastest growing private companies of 2010. This honor was repeated again in 2011, 2012 and 2013 as the firm continued to chart steady growth across all divisions. By 2013, Wunderlich’s Private Client Group had surpassed 200 financial advisors with $8 billion in client assets. During that year, the firm received a second capital investment through Altamont Capital Partners, a California-based private equity firm with over $1 billion in capital. Yet another notable milestone was Wunderlich Investment Company’s 2015 acquisition of Dominick & Dominick, an esteemed firm with a history spanning more than a century on Wall Street. This group of advisors continues to serve high-net worth investors from offices in New York, Miami and Atlanta as a division of the Wunderlich Securities Wealth Management division. Within a few months, the firm also added a Dallas-based investment advisory firm, Fiduciary Financial Services of the Southwest, with over $400 million in assets under management to our company. At the conclusion of its 2015 fiscal year in June, Wunderlich had 500 associates working in more than 25 locations across 17 states to manage $10+ billion of client assets. As Wunderlich looks forward to the 20th anniversary of its founding, the firm is committed to the vision that has led to its success thus far – remaining ever diligent in its focus to serve Wunderlich's clients well.","Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Sales and Marketing",1,Gary Wunderlich,251-500,1,M&A,40000000,USD,40000000,40000000,USD,40000000,Altamont Capital Partners,1,1,1,Private,,,,,,

About Us Great companies start with an idea and an inspiration. Our idea was to make the car buying process better, faster and simpler. And our inspiration was technology. In 1997 that spark led Mark Bonfigli, Rick Gibbs, Mike Lane, Jamie LaScolea and Ryan Dunn to found Dealer.com and begin redefining the expectations of the auto industry. By bringing a full suite of digital marketing tools to OEMs and dealers, coupled with direct consultation to make those tools work harder for customers, we helped to change the digital face of the industry. But we didn’t just focus on the world outside – we looked inward, to see how we could create a work environment that was unlike any other – where the desire to be creative, innovative, healthy, expressive and fun were nurtured and appreciated at a whole new level. It was the collective fostering of these missions that made Dealer.com what it is today: an 850-person strong company with bi-coastal offices serving 40 percent of the auto industry’s marketing needs; all made possible through a culture rich in openness, wellness, development, community engagement, and individuality.","Advertising, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Sales and Marketing",2,"Mark Bonfigli, Michael Lane",501-1000,4,M&A,5000000,USD,5000000,5000000,USD,5000000,"Accel, Apax Partners, Klass Capital",,3,2,Private,,,,,,

This is a multi-billion dollar problem across the US, but it is felt most severely in low-income communities. This problem will only get worse with climate change looming.   Off-grid water solutions are necessary for a future where no one has to worry about dirty water. Enter the NuTree - a novel on-site wastewater treatment device. It empowers everyday people to treat their own water by harnessing nature’s methods.   The NuTree is no harder to maintain than a fish tank or small garden, which makes the system easy to construct and affordable to maintain. Its modular units, at under $10,000 each, can scale to treat the waste from a single household to a growing business. With a circular, zero-waste system that includes water recycling, bioenergy, and growing crops the NuTree is a force of nature.
