They take the place of either Push-Pull or Scissors style brakes currently offered. D’s Locks work independently of the tire by locking the wheel at the hub. Tire types and air pressure no longer matter. Your wheels can be locked securely in place, regardless of tire condition. Because D’s Locks lock at the hub, they are the answer to suspension chairs. They mount completely out of the way, so thumbs stay intact. Additionally, the brakes are no longer the widest part of the chair. D’s locks add no width to the chair, and wheels can be taken on and off with the locks engaged. D’s Locks can be self-installed in usually less than an hour, with no special tools.  With D’s Locks, the danger of wheelchair movement and slippage during transfer is almost entirely removed.  Created by a wheel chair user and designed with the safety and autonomy of the wheelchair customer in mind, D’s Locks are durable and secure. One-finger operation allows for total control in wheelchair stability, eliminating the inconvenience and threat of injury during transfer associated with the use of standard wheelchair brakes. These safety benefits translate into increased freedom and peace of mind, decreasing the dependence on others. D’s Locks are durable, safe, and are compatible with most wheels and chairs.","Manufacturing, Professional Services",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

When I was young, growing up just outside New York City, I dreamt about adventure in far-off lands. So I left to live in the West as soon as I could. After more than 15 years, I returned to New York City to be near family. And an interesting thing happened when I did: in the middle of the Fashion Capital of the world, I couldn’t stand my clothes! Living and working in the city, I had to wear traditional office attire. But after my son was born, I went through a major re-shuffling of my priorities and one of the things nagging at me was how much time and energy I was spending maintaining my work clothes. Never mind all the ironing, even just washing my pants after each wear felt excessive and completely out of whack with what I really cared about and wanted to be doing with my time. What I needed was clothing that could keep up with my life. I needed pants equally comfortable for biking to work, presenting to a client, and wrestling on the grass in Central Park. And when all that was done, I wanted to throw them in my drawer to be worn again – without ironing or doing laundry. My first product is my dream pair of pants. I mixed the sense of purpose you find in outdoor gear, with comfort and technical fabrics ready for physical challenge, and refined looks appropriate to the office to create Bluff Works pants. My Bluffs are ready to be the one pair of pants you take to Southeast Asia for six weeks, or the one pair of pants you can wear to work six times without washing. Either way, they are designed to carry you far. I’m glad you’re here, excited you are interested in Bluff Works and eager to hear how you use my products! THE BLUFF WORKS COMPANY Bluff Works is headquartered in NYC where I currently live and where the pants are produced. The vibe of the company is from Portland, Oregon where I lived for many years and have employed the Sandstrom Partners design firm. I am passionate about good products, taking care of my customers, building a team of people I want to be around, and having a positive impact on the world. These may be traits we have in common.","Clothing and Apparel, Community and Lifestyle, Design, Sports",1,Stefan Loble,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

We are all seasoned product developers, understanding what it takes to get a product to market; our PD heritage is what makes us different from other innovation and research firms. Clinvue is united by a passion for innovation and firm belief that the best solutions are born of a deep understanding of real-time (current) insight into the realities of the rapidly evolving international healthcare environment. Our experience covers a broad range of medical specialties from cardiology to thoracic surgery, imaging to drug delivery, surgical instruments to high volume disposables, and educational services to medical sales and corporate communications. We’re at home scrubbed-in in the OR for 8 hours, in the boardroom, or working with a child or elderly patient in their home. Clinvue's staff is respected worldwide for their knowledge of clinical practice and industry best-practice. You will find us lecturing undergraduate and graduate classes at Virginia Tech, Hopkins or Purdue or sharing our knowledge, tools and principles at B2B events around the globe. Most frequently, we’re working with our clients, not only to achieve a specific project goal but also to leave a legacy of best-practice. Our clients include both global corporations (where we support both upstream marketing, product management, and R&D functions) and start-up companies, providing a turn-key function for a specific period or program. Clinvue's staff has contributed to a broad range of products including: surgical robots, patient monitoring, patient rehabilitation, and numerous surgical instruments and surgical devices from laparoscopic tools to wound care products. In the world of high volume disposables we have addressed patient safety, sample collection, product packaging, drug delivery, and even drug disposal. We’re regularly hands-on in the USA, UK, and mainland Europe. Increasingly we are being asked to bring back and translate insight from South America, India, China and beyond. One thing we can guarantee is that what is right for one market is rarely right for another and therein lies the very point of gaining cost effective, on-the-ground insight; insight that needs to go beyond simply procedural understanding and product use, to culture, environment, attitudes, and support structure. Recent experience with a FT Global 500 medical company highlighted how pressures of patient throughput in emerging medical markets can have a major impact upon product use, re-use, attitudes toward disposables, packaging, sterility, and consequently, product specification and design. Getting these things right will have a dramatic effect upon adoption in emerging markets and Clinvue helps decode this ‘Product DNA’.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
