As young athletes move up in the world, many times they are faced with living on their own for the first time.  They are having to feed themselves for the first time, they have constantly changing class, practice and sleep schedules.  This is an extremely stressful time of change for many athletes.  NutriUnit is there to help bring regularity and accountability back into their lives and help them reach the goals they and their coaches have set for them. Almost every aspect of an athlete's training is down to a science; their lifting, their practices, cycling their intensity, as well as game preparation.  Competition is ingrained in all these areas. NutriUnit is extending that same competitive drive into your athletes' nutrition. By seeing their teammates progress throughout the day, they are constantly reminded of what they can do to stay competitive. The NutriUnit nutrition algorithm gives each athlete a custom nutrition goal which changes with their training intensity and whether they are in or out of season.

The singular focus of TOLIS Group™ is the development and support of ultra-reliable data backup, restore, and archival solutions for end-users and OEMs based on TOLIS Group's proven BRU™ technology. The genesis of BRU in 1985 as a commercially available tool was driven by the inability of popular tar-based operations to reliably backup and restore archives on Unix systems. The mandate of BRU's design was to return the most data possible during a restore, limited only by physical damage. In January of 2005 TOLIS Group announced its bruAPP™ Backup Appliance solution.   bruAPP™ is a data backup and restore-focused appliance that delivers the industry's first truly ""server-less"" backup services across client/server system topologies. The bruAPP™ Backup Appliance virtually eliminates the configuration, installation, and compatibility issues faced when designing and building a data backup system. In January of 2010, TOLIS Group entered further into the hardware market providing one stop shopping and support for tape and BRU software bundled offerings. In 2018 TOLIS Group will enter the Windows market with BRU Producer's Edition™ for Windows, and enhanced offerings to it's bruAPP™ Backup Appliance for the Windows user.
