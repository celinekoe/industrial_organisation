The combination of Global Resource Investments with Sprott Inc. in 2011 produced a powerful alliance for natural resource investors. Sprott, Inc. employs more than 130 professionals and manage in excess of $8 Billion in resource investments. They believe that they are the largest investment house in the world that is focused on small capitalization natural resource stocks. The merged entity offers access to investment opportunities in all resource sectors across the globe. Sprott Global, headquarted in Carlsbad, California, employs financial advisers with decades of experience in the industry.  In fact, many of their financial advisors worked in various natural resource industries before they began their financial services career, thus making their advice  more valuable than the advice you might receive from a generalist stock broker at a mainstream brokerage firm or an order-taking clerk at a discount brokerage. This experience, along with their dedication to both visiting project sites and evaluating company finances, allows us to provide thorough analysis on the prospects of natural resource companies. their sole focus is helping investors and speculators like you make profits, so we do not waste any of their time on sectors outside of their area of expertise.","Energy, Financial Services",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
