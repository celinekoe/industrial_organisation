While the company's objective is long-term ownership, a history of strategically timed dispositions has allowed for the redeployment of capital into a fully owned core portfolio. This approach has resulted in the accumulation by the individual principals of one of the most respected, privately owned Manhattan office and retail portfolios amassed over the last 35 years. Similarly, property operations managed by Meringoff Properties, Inc. adhere to the principle of in-house, vertically integrated ""owner/management"" common to multigenerational New York family portfolios.

With RideConnect, you can schedule your rides, or order a car from a simple interface. RideConnect is a ridesharing platform. Casual and commercial drivers can offer transportation directly to their riders through RideConnect, thereby keeping what money they make. With RideConnect, people in cities, towns or any other type of community can organize their own rideshare even where other car service options don't exist. Features RideBoard A centralized scheduler for rides. Riders can schedule their rides with their preferred drivers up to 24 hrs in advance. Drivers can announce their trips so that riders can ask for a ride. My Community A dynamic list of riders and drivers sourced from your private contacts. You control who's in and who's out. You can never rideshare with a total stranger because everyone in your community is either directly connected to you or through someone else in your community. RideMode See where the rider is, how long to the pick up, and the progress of the ride. Communicate with one another using the walkie-talkie. Best Practices Do not use RideConnect in places where such services are illegal. RideConnect is not a taxi service. RideConnect is software that can be used by taxi and car services in order to offer their transportation services to customers. When giving people a ride, do not handle your phone and drive at the same time, this is dangerous. RideConnect is inherently private. The only way people can get onto your Community is if you add them outside the app. You are responsible for who is a part of your community. You can manage your community by removing people from your phone book, or unfriending them on Facebook. You can also block people within the My Community screen in RideConnect and this will prevent them from sharing rides with you but will not remove them from your community. Be safe. Drive safe. Ride safe. That's it. Start sharing rides.",Transportation,1,Santosh Krishnan,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
