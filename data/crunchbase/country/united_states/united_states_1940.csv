Their innovative FluidVisionTM accommodating intraocular lens (IOL) is poised to help individuals affected by presbyopia and/or cataracts regain the ability to dynamically adjust focus for clear vision at all distances. Fifty years ago, vision correction surgery was changed forever by the invention of the intraocular lens, which is used to treat a cataract – a clouding and hardening of the dime-sized, normally clear, crystalline lens inside your eye which can rob you of your vision in your 60’s, 70’s and 80’s. PowerVision set out to dramatically improve vision correction surgery again. They began the development of their FluidVision IOL, which mimics the way a healthy eye works and can restore clear vision at all distances, near, far, and everywhere in between.   It uses a tiny amount of fluid inside the lens and natural eye muscles to change shape and adjust focus just the way your healthy eye does. For the more than 20 million people with cataracts in the U.S. and, ultimately, the more than 90 million with Presbyopia – the loss of ability to focus up close that affects people in their 40’s and 50’s – the FluidVision lens can potentially give them freedom from ever needing glasses, contacts or any vision correction procedure again.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",2,"Barry Cheskin, Matthew Frinzi",51-100,8,M&A,122927457,USD,122927457,122927457,USD,122927457,"Medtronic, Venrock, Correlation Ventures, Aisling Capital, Frazier Healthcare Partners",2,11,,Private,,,,,,

It flies completely automatically after takeoff, with no pilot intervention needed. Flexrotor quickly assembles for flight, can be rapidly re-stowed in its compact case for storage and transported on a small flatbed truck. Aerovel Flexrotor has a flight endurance of more than 32 hours, which is a record-setting Group 2 UAS flight endurance, and a 100-kilometer communications range. It is an all-weather aircraft that has operated in harsh conditions including off of various vessels in the Arctic and tropics. A fixed-wing aircraft, Aerovel Flexrotor requires no runway or launch and retrieval equipment.
