Mark Wachter – our own shoe genius - founded On the Run in 1977 on a very basic principle: 'When it comes to people’s feet and well-being, I don’t settle.' Using that principle as his beacon, Mark transformed a modest shoe store into the best foot health retailer in the Bay Area. It all started with Stanley Wachter. In 1964, Stanley and his wife Lidia brought their young children, Luba and Marek (Mark), to San Francisco from war-torn Warsaw, Poland. Stanley worked as a tailor at the famous San Francisco clothier Fritzi’s and instilled in both his children a passion for customer service and the desire to improve peoples’ quality of life. In 1974, Luba started Luba Designs - a women's clothing store - in what is now CitiShoes at 751 Irving Street. In 1977, Mark opened On the Run on the 1300 block of 9th Avenue.  Inspired by his passion for improving his customers’ quality of life, Mark began utilizing the knowledge and experience he had gained to design and manufacture his own brand of high-quality orthotics, imported from Poland and Germany. In 2005, he added CitiShoes based on the principle that “just because it’s fashion, doesn’t mean it can’t be comfortable.” CitiShoes offers the same focus on foot health and shoe customization in fashion shoes.Today, Mark trains all of his sales associates to biomechanically evaluate specific foot issues and match shoes to specific individual needs. At On the Run & CitiShoes – we believe that a knowledgeable and courteous staff that provides genuine and specific customer service can offer far more than “discount prices” can.","Clothing and Apparel, Commerce and Shopping, Consumer Goods, Health Care, Other, Professional Services, Sales and Marketing, Sports",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

By interfacing with existing POS software, virtual bills are updated on the customer's phone in real-time.  Customers order through the server verbally, like normal.  When the server inputs the order into the POS, Brio reads the tab and delivers the update to the customer's phone.  When the patron is ready to pay, they can split & pay right from their mobile device.  This sends a tokenized payment back to the POS and closes the tab via the payment processor that exists on the POS system (i.e. There is no manual close-out process and no need for a third party payment processor). The utilization of existing POS software and payment processors means no additional hardware costs or training for servers.  All processes remain the same while the efficiencies of mobile payment drive increased customer and server satisfaction, table turnover, and profitability. Mobile payments allow Brio to collect unprecedented consumer feedback.  Upon submitting payment, Brio automatically delivers a unique survey to each user.  The survey consists of each item paid for by that user, and is accompanied with options to give each a thumbs up or down, as well as comment.  The streamlined process allows Brio to collect more feedback and aggregate the information more easily than ever before. This information helps management be proactive in QA, menu review, and training.  There may be dozens of people night who have negative comments regarding a dish, but hold their tongue as to not cause an awkward situation, or because the dish was only mediocre.  The ability to indicate displeasure in a dish or experience without causing a potentially awkward situation allows for unadulterated feedback and more of it as nobody has to go out of their way to indicate their displeasure. In the future, this feedback will also be leveraged in personalized menu generation and targeted suggestions in order to optimize the experience of every individual who steps foot in partner establishments.  Through the convenience of mobile payments and unprecedented feedback, Brio is set to optimize the dining experience for patrons, servers, and management alike.","Apps, Financial Services, Information Technology, Mobile, Software",,,1-10,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,Madworks Seed Accelerator,1,1,,Private,,,,,,
