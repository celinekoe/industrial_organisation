Goal: Put their grandkids on a strong financial footing, a serious need given the financial challenges the majority of Millennial parents face (student loan debt, high housing costs, overall high costs of raising kids). Financial Firms - B2C: New-fangled Facebook- and Paperless Post-inspired incremental marketing platform for our financial firm partners to capture and retain trillions in assets passing along to the next generations, including while the Boomer grandparents are still alive. Problem / Solution:  With mounting college debt and other expenses, Millennial parents are struggling to put their youngsters’ on a strong financial footing. Traditional options for saving and investing are falling woefully short. Ballooning Nest Eggs helps solve this problem by tackling a singular pain point: Parents prefer financial gifts for their kids, but rarely receive them beyond a few discrete life events because asking for money is awkward. Meanwhile, the Boomer grandparents and great aunts and uncles – who’d love to pitch in – are too often sitting on the sidelines, holding onto the bulk of their assets until they pass away.  Our patented app strikes at the heart of what’s missing in the marketplace – all the social tools parents need to tastefully steer and conveniently enable family and friends – including the grandparents - to gift their kids money for their slew of celebrations, large and small. Think birthday party invitations, birth announcements and grin-worthy social updates, which graciously put gifting on the radar and for the first time are connected to the kids’ financial accounts held with our financial partners.    Notably, our app spurs financial gifting by engaging Millennials in their favored “currency” – social sharing – while giving financial firms an entirely new, more meaningful ways to acquire, retain and deepen relationships with this coveted demographic, expected to inherit $15 trillion in the coming decade, and their close Boomer relatives.  Overall, Ballooning Nest Eggs helps parents collect the assets; our financial partners manage them.","Community and Lifestyle, Financial Services",1,Amy Moses,1-10,2,Seed,513000,USD,513000,513000,USD,513000,,,,,Private,,,,,,
