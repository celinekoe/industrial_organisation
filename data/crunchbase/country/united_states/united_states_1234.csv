Caraa was founded to address major white space in the millennial consumer market. The most active generation yet, 81 percent of millennials practice group fitness vs. 61 percent of their baby boomer parents. This overwhelming majority factors the location and timing of their fitness class around their daily routine. While there are significant number of active apparel brands to address this demand, the options for well made, versatile, and luxurious sports bags are practically nonexistent. We collected data across 12 major US metropolitan areas and saw that 86 percent of millennials who exercise daily carry separate bags for the studio/gym and office, and nearly 100% of them are in the market for a singular bag that can be used from morning until night, seamlessly transitioning between work, fitness, and social activities. We have since created the world’s first “luxeletica” collection: the perfect set of hybrid handbags that strike balance between craftsmanship, quality, and sport functionalities. To disrupt the traditional luxury leather goods and accessories market, we source our materials from Milan, Italy and use the same luxury nylon, leather, and hardware as luxury brands like Chanel and Louis Vuitton, but charge honest retail prices below $500. Our products have high function design features including tech compartments, hidden air ventilation, and water-repellent and moisture-wicking materials.

Luggage Free was founded in 2001 and launched in April of 2003 by Eric Mautner and Barry Wolf, owners of Need It Now Courier Service. Initially founded at a time of chronic air traffic delays and mounting customer dissatisfaction about airline service in general, including baggage handling. Today, while both the delays and the complaints have plunged along with airline traffic, the tighter security and increased baggage fees have bolstered the incentive for some travelers to have someone else handle their luggage. In 2004 Jeff Boyd became president of Luggage Free and the number of bags the company shipped doubled each year from 2004 to 2007, with shipments reaching around 40,000 in 2007. Luggage Free cooperates with a network of agents and carriers to retrieve luggage from a client’s location at a specific time, insure them and then wraps the luggage in plastic protective packaging. Luggage Free prices by the weight and dimensions of the shipment. The overwhelming success of Luggage Free can be attributed to the White Glove treatment, which protects travelers from lost luggage, check-in and baggage claim wait-time at the airport as well as weight restrictions; the difference is evident from the moment you pick up the phone. With over 41 million complaints of lost luggage by airline passengers in 2011, Luggage Free continues to grow in over 140 countries worldwide.","Other, Transportation, Travel and Tourism",2,"Barry Wolf, Eric Mautner",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Pleotint was founded by Harlan Byker, Ph.D., the sole inventor of the electrochromic (EC) technology used by Gentex Corporation (NASDAQ:GNTX) in its auto-dimming automotive rearview mirrors.  As a result of that invention, Gentex is worth over $5 billion today.   Suntuitive utilizes thermochromics, a completely different technology than the EC technology used by Gentex.  It’s also significantly different than the solid-state EC technology used in its competitors' products.  Suntuitive is a robust commercial product that Pleotint is selling, and the company believes that Suntuitive will have broader appeal than the EC windows as Pleotint ramps up its marketing efforts and generates greater awareness that Suntuitive exists and is a great alternative, energy-efficient product.  Suntuitive is the only dynamic glass technology that does not require electricity and human and/or software intervention or controls to work.  Suntuitive dynamic windows are based on a sunlight-responsive, thermochromic interlayer, which is activated by heat from direct sunlight, causing the window to tint as necessary.  The thermochromic elements are embedded in a PVB (polyvinyl butyral) interlayer, which is then laminated between two sheets of glass.  This laminate is then incorporated into the final product, a dynamic insulated glass unit (d-IGU). The Suntuitive interlayer darkens in direct sunlight to block excess solar heat gain. It also blocks virtually all the ultraviolet, while maintaining a view and maximizing daylighting since it clears up in the absence of direct sunlight (https://suntuitiveglass.com/optimized-daylighting/).  There is no electricity used to make this resilient product work and the window unit installs in the same way a traditional unit does. Suntuitive adapts to all seasons and weather, and the glass tints to a neutral gray. Tinting takes place only when there is direct sun and the potential for excess solar heat gain. The tinting is largely independent of ambient temperatures.  Our competitors’ EC windows add complexity, as they have to be hardwired in the building, require electricity and controls to work, and tint to blue.  Suntuitive windows are at pricing parity with those EC windows prior to their added costs for wiring and controls.  Suntuitive is the only truly “green” dynamic window on the market.","Consumer Electronics, Consumer Goods, Manufacturing, Real Estate, Science and Engineering, Sustainability",2,"David Byker, Harlan Byker",101-250,1,Early Stage Venture,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

They are reclaiming the vast, remaining reserves from their Nation’s producing oil fields. They focus on acquiring fields with existing production that are underdeveloped and located within formations that have demonstrated good historical production. Cardinal is a long term asset play, in a traditional energy sector that continues to grow globally. They are managed by public company and energy industry professionals that are admired and dedicated to their craft. They are a resourceful player suited to take advantage of the industry downturn. Their management brings the depth of experience and diversity to steer Cardinal’s future. Their team has an average of over 25 years’ experience, with some of their individuals approaching 40 years’ of know-how in their respective fields of expertise. Their finding and lifting cost of production is significantly lower than the national average because they pursue shallow oil, within know formations that have good historical production. Consequently they will be profitable in the $30.00 range should the price of oil ever reach that low. Furthermore, they are not over leveraged like many of their competition; they have a small staff of executives and professionals, which keeps their overhead low. And they outsource all well drilling and completing operations. However, they maintain pumping operations and administration once a well is complete. They anticipated this price decline during the formation of their company. Their research indicated that America was emerging as the number one producer of oil and gas in the world due to new technology that has unlocked its vast shale reserves. They also understood that the Russian, Mid-Eastern and South American oil companies were producing at record levels. These unfolding events coupled with waning global demand for oil indicated to us that the energy sector would naturally decline. Therefore they developed Cardinal to take full advantage of the next upswing by positioning their company to exploit the emerging opportunities in this downturn. Many of their competitors are suffering from the price collapse of oil, making them unprofitable. As new assets become available from financially strapped companies, they can selectively choose the best of their distressed prospects as they become available at deep discounts.",Energy,,,11-50,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Public,2010-01-21,,,CEGX,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/cardinal-energy-ipo--9c376b3e,OTC Pink
