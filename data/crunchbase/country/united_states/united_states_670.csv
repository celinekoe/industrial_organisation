More people are blogging than ever. But at the same time, more people today prefer to listen rather than read. So, we thought: What if bloggers could offer a way for people to listen to their content? Converting a written blog to a podcast involves what’s known as text-to-speech. But text-to-speech alone cannot create podcasts that connect with people. Good podcasts need more than a voice to tell the story: They need music and rhythm to create an emotional impact. That’s why we came up with BuildBubbles. It’s a web app that can help bloggers easily make awesome podcasts without a microphone or studio equipment. Bloggers do not even need to know how to edit the podcast. BuildBubbles converts written blog posts into compelling podcasts with sound design! With BuildBubbles, your blog will stand out and you’ll reach a much wider audience. As a content provider, you spend a lot of time creating interesting content. Make sure it reaches as many people as possible! BuildBubbles is easy and intuitive. Just three steps and a few minutes and it’s done! 1. Paste a link of your WordPress blog post you’d like to convert to a podcast 2. Choose the BuildBubbles podcast template and voices you want 3. Edit your podcast if you wish. Once you’re finished, you can download it or embed it in your blog. Please try it!

We offer two unique value propositions: 1) Curate only the most valuable and relevant content for individuals and groups to conduct in-depth stock research. 2) A platform for investment clubs at colleges, universities, and business schools to share internally-generated stock research. Our Research Center is a source for unprecedented, curated content on best-of-breed companies.  We believe that investors struggle with the flood of information available online, often missing the most valuable content or intimidated to even begin the research process.  We solve this problem by filtering information down to “only what matters,” utilizing a technology and human layer to ensure only the best information is displayed on our system. The Research Center makes in-depth stock research easier than ever as it’s a one-stop-shop for investors interested in becoming more-informed about a stock.  Here’s what we offer: • Investor presentations and financial data from the company’s Investor Relations page. • Webcast, transcript, and Investors Mosaic summary of the last four conference calls. • Webcast for the most recent Wall Street Conference. • Top 10 company-specific articles and presentations. • Top 10 industry-related articles and presentations. • Top management interviews from conferences, trade shows, and television. • Detailed financial model, including income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow. Our platform for investment clubs, called the Report Library, aggregates internally-generated stock research the clubs prepare for their investment decision-making process.  For example, students write detailed reports outlining industry dynamics, competitive landscape, product offerings, and financial model for any stock they propose to add to their portfolio.  Since much of this data has a long “shelf life” such as industry size, growth rate, and competitors, there is no need to reinvent the wheel when beginning research on a company.  We want students to use a historical report in our system as the baseline for their analysis, add incremental information, update the financial model, and upload the new report back to the system.  The goal is to allow time-constrained students to conduct fundamental analysis more efficiently by leveraging the power of cumulative knowledge.","Financial Services, Lending and Investments",2,"Evan McCormick, Josh Tucker",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
