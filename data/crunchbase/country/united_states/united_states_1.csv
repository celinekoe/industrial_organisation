Initially focusing on preventing access to un-secured alcoholic beverages and to help local convenience stores reduce loss due to theft. While increasing convenience, future revenues and safety of the retailers and their customers. Traken has engineered and developed the HopsLock™ ID Verification System for use by retailers of beer. The HopsLock™ device serves as a deterrent to would be beer thieves by leveraging the responsibility of access to the beer coolers to the customers of the retail stores and taking the burden off employees and managers.  After querying several local convenience store locations in a major chain throughout the valley we have discovered that beer theft, on average accounts for approximately $7,000 per quarter and some locations have reported upwards of $30,000 in theft per quarter.  By combining our current system with the MOBICLOUD and utilizing the IP's algorithm we will be able to store/retrieve the data from each swipe of an ID. This information can then be SECURELY and wirelessly transmitted and retrieved anywhere from the secure cloud. This data will be used in several ways to include: Prosecution of crimes committed against retailers, data collection and analysis of market, specific target advertisement based on collected data. The aforementioned features will initially create an immediate deterrent to those who commit beer theft crimes against retailers.The evolution of the IP will allow future products to be accessed remotely and securely which will give us a unique ability to safely retrieve customer's data without the risk of identity theft. The secure wireless abilities allow us to cut costs during installation by eliminating the dependence of wired devices and onsite hard drives. By lowering our cost we directly lower our customers cost and are capable of delivering a superior product at appropriate prices.","Information Technology, Internet Services, Privacy and Security, Software",3,"Joshua J.
