Leadis designs, develops and markets analog and mixed-signal semiconductors that enable and enhance the features and capabilities of mobile and consumer electronics devices. Their first core product area was color display drivers with integrated controllers. These are integral components that translate digital display data into analog voltages that drive the liquid crystal or OLED array of displays used in mobile consumer electronics devices. The performance characteristics of a display driver are critical to the visual quality and appeal of the images and text generated on the display as well as the power efficiency of the mobile device. Starting in 2007, they began offering LED driver and audio solutions including a CODEC with headphone amplifier and FM transmitter. Leadis LED driver ICs drive a precisely controlled current through the light emitting diodes of mobile backlighting units found in small panel color LCD displays. Their LED drivers feature flexible current configurability through a 1-wire or I2C interface and best-in-class efficiency, resulting in longer battery life for portable devices. When coupled with Leadis PowerLiteline of LCD display drivers, their LED driver solutions can help customers achieve power savings up to 50% compared with standard architectures. Leadis audio solutions also feature significant differentiating advantages for their customers. Their CODEC with integrated headphone amplifier delivers excellent audio performance at one-third the power dissipation compared to competitive offerings. It also incorporates a high efficiency capless mode that eliminates the large DC blocking capacitors commonly used by other amplifiers, resulting in a smaller solution footprint and lower BOM cost. Their FM transmitter product similarly reduces parts count and BOM costs, while delivering broadcast quality FM signals suitable for worldwide FM band operation in regions including the U.S., Europe, and Japan. The current focus for their products includes the wireless handset market and MP3/4 markets, where high performance display drivers, LED drivers, and CODECs allow handset and consumer electronics manufacturers to provide differentiating low power display and audio features to attract wireless service providers and consumers. Indeed, their products offer an attractive value proposition for any mobile consumer electronics device where best-in-class power consumption can enable end-product differentiation via longer battery life and, ultimately, a more pleasing consumer experience. Leadis products are sold directly to display module manufacturers, wireless handset manufacturers, and mobile consumer electronics manufacturers.","Hardware, Science and Engineering, Software",1,Steve Ahn,51-100,,IPO,,,,,,,,,,1,Delisted,2004-06-16,2009-10-23,day,LDIS,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/leadis-technology-ipo--41547261,NASDAQ

The company employs a proprietary platform to discern the gut microbiome’s role in the cause and progression of disease. Therapeutics are developed to precisely target pathogenic pathways in the gut lumen. AI capabilities efficiently identify drug candidates with desired characteristics which are validated in the company’s lab.  Products consist of small molecule drugs. Piton does NOT develop live bacterial therapeutics (LBTs) or seek to modify the composition of microbiota in the gut. Piton’s lead pipelines, IBD/Ulcerative Colitis & Autism Spectrum Disorder, target unmet needs in markets with 5 million and 50+ million patients, respectively. Parkinson’s Disease constitutes a third area of focus. Piton's therapeutic approach for Ulcerative Colitis uniquely targets a cause of the disease for a sub-type constituting ~45% of the patient population. The approach has strong support in the clinical community and represents a potential ‘paradigm change’ in the treatment of the disease. In-human trials are anticipated in 2025. Recently published research suggests that Piton’s therapeutic strategy for UC may have application in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and weight loss management. Piton’s therapeutic approach for Autism Spectrum Disorder has been validated in successive, in-vivo experiments. Several drug candidates are under consideration for what could be the first approved drug to treat the core symptoms of ASD. Application of Piton’s discovery platform for Parkinson’s Disease led to the discovery of a causative hypothesis and a target for novel therapeutic intervention. Given strong links between this hypothesis and many chronic diseases, including Intestinal Bowel Disease (IBD), this program may hold cross-disease blockbuster potential.

Pistons must be lubricated to survive. Lubrication must be cooled to survive. Cooling gasoline engines throws away two-thirds of the energy of the fuel.  Basic efficiency of gasoline engines is 25%. Their engine does not use cooling and so it has three times as much energy to work with. The introduction of the supersonic supercharger, the patented key component of Tomorrow's Engine, produces piston-like compression without using any cooling.  So this supercharger has three times as much gasoline energy to work with as gasoline piston engines. With good design, autos can run on 1/3 as much fuel.  That also means 1/3 as much emissions such as CO2. The new supercharger engine has 90% fewer parts than piston engines and will substantially lower the cost of cars.   The supersonic supercharger can also provide greater efficiencies in heating and refrigeration equipment.

The facility is all cage free and consists of a hotel, pet spa and indoor dog park. The play area has an agility course, toys and even a wading pool.     Americans love for dogs continues to grow and dog lovers consider their pets as family and are willing to go to extreme measures to protect and care for their furry best friends. Combine love of pets with the busy work lives that two income households must live, and the massive opportunity becomes clear.    Otis & Friends was named after the founders English Bull Dog, Otis. The family has three dogs and found it very difficult to get care for their dogs. In fact, the Rawitch Family has been paying $125 per day, to have their 3 dogs cared for. Even with that expense, they found that most Pet Sitters did not show up as promised. Yes, the dogs were fed, but the Pet Sitter did not walk them or play with them This was discovered through the use of Web Cams used at their front door.    Otis & Friends is a safe and secure place to leave your dog, whether you want them to stay and play for the day, or overnight, while you travel. Web Cams will be located in each room of the facility, giving owners the pleasure and security of watching their dog 24/7, should they desire. This is not uncommon for other upscale Doggy Day Care businesses. However, they take it another step! Each Dog will be provided with a Micro Camera that is worn on the dogs collar. So, not only can you watch your pet play, you can also see the world as your Furry Friend see's it all day long.    The business is being build with concierge service that includes Red carpet drop off. The client will be met at their car, given a fresh cup of coffee, while they gently whish their baby away, for a day of play.
