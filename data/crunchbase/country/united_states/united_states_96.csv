Our products yield more than 50% revenues in an almost unlimited market. Our technology was tested and approved by the premier experts in the field - the Dutch government (see movie in the external links). After successful establishment of our activity we offer you the opportunity to join us and become a part of the success. Now you can invest in the only known company that developed and implemented a proven technology that mines cellulose from wastewater (WW), an endless untapped source of cellulose, transforming it into profits. ACT’s patented technology automatically recycles cellulose from WW in commercial facilities, thus reducing sludge by up to 50%. The unique Sewage Recycling System (SRS) mines the cellulose from WW, recycling and processing it into a clean, pasteurized, environmentally-friendly product called Recyllose™ (recycled cellulose).  This Recyllose™ provides ACT with an additional high-margin and recurring revenue source as it is a valuable commodity perfect for various industries. Recyllose™ is used in plastics, insulation, pulp & paper, construction, bio-fuels production, and more, and directly meets the tightening global standards for WW treatment & sludge disposal. In addition to the revenues from the Recyllose™, the SRS technology offers further operational & environmental benefits:  •	Reduces plant OPEX & energy consumption by up to 30% •	Increases plant capacity by up to 30% •	Reduces GHG emissions and carbon footprint ACT is the first sewage mining company in the world to convert WW into a valuable resource, while producing a dual source of income– sales of the SRS itself, and a recurring revenue stream from the process’ recycled by-product.
