This is our story. In May 1872, a tall, 34 year-old, red-bearded lawyer stepped down from the stage-coach at the Plaza of Los Angeles. Corporate attorney John Bicknell had his sights on building a law practice. What greeted him at the stage was a humble little pueblo with dusty unpaved street, no industry and scant business. He saw a pueblo of narrow streets and alleys between decrepit adobe buildings roofed with ""brea"" from tar pits west of the city. Bicknell, who had summed up his philosophy this way when counseling a younger lawyer, ""The safe way is to select a business that you will be satisfied to follow and build up a business of your own."" He began to follow his own advice. By the 1880s, he had attracted one of the region's most important clients, the Southern Pacific Railroad. It took time to select a quality partner. But in 1890, Bicknell, a Republican, teamed with Walter Trask, a Democratic litigator, thus launching the unbroken chain of partnership that today is Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. Also launched was a set of unique firm attributes. Those included selecting only quality lawyers; balancing ideas across the political spectrum; and providing powerful resources in both transactional and litigation-related legal services. More than a century later, these attributes still define today's Gibson Dunn. In 1897 Judge James Gibson joined the firm, thus instituting another Gibson Dunn tradition – hiring lawyers who make an impact in their communities. In 1903, in a move that created the largest firm in Los Angeles, Bicknell, Trask and Gibson merged their practice with that of former Los Angeles City Attorney William Dunn and former Assistant City Attorney Albert Crutcher. Carried out at the behest of a client in order to create a ""full-service"" firm, the combination was called an ""experiment"" in the local press. It has worked ever since. Nearly 100 years later, the press recently dubbed the firm ""The Rescue Squad"" for its response and service to clients in legal need. Another article remarked that it remains easier to get into the CIA than to become a lawyer at Gibson Dunn. The firm grew as the region grew, into both Northern and Southern California, and both nationally and internationally. By the 1970s, Gibson Dunn had offices in London and Paris. Shortly thereafter, the firm took the bold step of launching its practice in the nation's capital and New York. Since 2000, the firm has further expanded in Europe, South America, the Middle East and Asia. As John Bicknell might say, the firm has ""built up a business"", based on those attributes of quality, balance and impact and on an unrelenting mission of achieving success for clients – a mission shared today by approximately 1000 lawyers worldwide.",Professional Services,2,"John Bicknel, Walter Trask",1001-5000,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Our philosophy is simple: An  enjoyable travel experience does not involve carrying or checking your luggage.   A great vacation does not begin at the baggage carousel, or worse yet, with lost or late arriving  luggage or sports equipment. In 2004, two guys who had met in high school and spent their share of time schlepping bags through airports set out to fundamentally change the way people travel.  Luggage Forward has since grown to become the leading provider of door-to-door luggage and sports equipment delivery to more than 200 countries and territories worldwide.   Offering a range of specialized options allowing clients the convenience of traveling without their bags, Luggage Forward has multiple services and price points to fit the requirements of almost any itinerary.  The company has pioneered a straightforward process of forwarding luggage by leveraging proprietary technology as well as trusted relationships with a comprehensive network of agents and shippers, resulting in unparalleled reliability. Luggage Forward’s industry-leading set of online tools allows clients to generate pricing, securely book online and track luggage real-time.  Powered by the proprietary Automated Routing Control™ system, the Luggage Forward website is able to instantly identify the most reliable, convenient and cost-effective method of shipment for each individual booking. Beginning in 2009, Luggage Forward embarked on a strategy of consolidation of the then-fragmented luggage shipping industry. Ultimately, seven different brands have been acquired so far. The combined industry experience of these companies approaches 50 years.
