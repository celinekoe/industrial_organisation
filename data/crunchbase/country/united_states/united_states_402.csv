The pace of technological change is faster than ever before in today’s global economy, and competitive advanced technologies are critical to national economic growth. Private-sector investments in research and development are mainly focused on incremental improvements to capture faster returns to companies and their shareholders. Few financial institutions, venture capitalists, and angel investors fund unproven, early-stage technologies. This strategy, however, erodes the groundwork for game-changing advances that are key to creating new capabilities, improving productivity, and ensuring growth. This is where ATP comes in.
