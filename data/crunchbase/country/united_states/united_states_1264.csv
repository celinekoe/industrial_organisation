Whistle allows businesses to respond or triage incoming messages via a real-time chat interface to and from the customer's preferred app. Whistle supports the popular mobile messaging apps that your customers are already comfortable using, saving your customers from downloading an additional app. The massive adoption of mobile messaging apps validates these communication channels as pillars of private conversation. Whistle enables businesses to leverage this trend. Customers who ignore available help resources create a disconnect with a company's staff. Whistle bridges this disconnect by providing customer communication options with which the customer is most comfortable engaging. Customers turn to Social Media and public forums as the go-to channel for complaints. Your customers are provided an intermediary outlet for complaints, praise, and interaction. Unresolved customer complaints lead to negative reviews, which impact sales. Whistle ensures follow through by both parties and discourages false claims by saving a history of all communication between customers and staff.

Parabola,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/parabola,"Financial Services, FinTech, Mobile Apps, SaaS","Charleston, South Carolina, United States",Parabola is a SaaS for financial advisors. We use gamification to automatically track a user's progress against financial goals.,"188,159","East Coast, Southern US",Less than $1M,Closed,2015-04-03,day,,,2020-01-01,year,For Profit,https://www.myparabola.com,"Parabola is a mobile app specifically designed to help improve retirement plan participation and outcomes; educate, encourage, reward savings habits; and provide financial advisors with the tools and up-to-date information necessary to proactively support the success of the individual and determined goals within the advisors prescribed financial plan. We all know that the defined contribution plan system at present has massive room for improvement. By and large, employees simply don't save enough to retire well. Most participants have a ""set it and forget it” mentality during an enrollment meeting and that’s the last time they are engaged. Parabola aims to disrupt the current retirement system by optimizing it to reach its full potential and finally be an adequate replacement for the obsolete defined benefit plan liability. In other words – pushing the probability light years ahead toward meeting the saver’s needs. The Parabola mobile app helps the end user reduce financial stress by linking their accounts and automatically tracking progress toward nearly 50 common and pre-defined financial goals. The user is notified when they reach a goal and awarded a badge, similar to what you might see with Fitbit or other fitness-related concepts.  Because the user has linked their various accounts (the average adult has 16 different accounts from credit cards to checking/savings to car and mortgage loans), they can more consistently and easily make deposits, enhancements, asset allocations, evaluations, and more. Their advisor (who provides the mobile app) receives a more complete financial picture much more quickly than the typical data collection method and can give better financial advice as a result. Rather than focusing on data collection, the advisor can best utilize time helping the client. This information is always up to date and readily available. Our primary goal is to drive users to increase contributions to their company retirement plans and personal investments. The natural effect is better outcomes toward achieving goals while AUM increases which helps advisors build AUM (and their compensation) more quickly.","Apps, Financial Services, Mobile, Software",1,Joshua Hatter,1-10,1,Seed,75000,USD,75000,75000,USD,75000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

However, it has become apparent that introducing AI to traditional industries requires a new and more collaborative approach. We started as a fund focused on investing in AI startups, but quickly understood that AI startups have little trouble raising money. Instead, they have a whole assortment of other common needs and challenges with building their businesses. That’s why we didn’t stop at the fund. We created the Labs programs, each providing an environment in which to build and grow companies. We partner with established industry brands to give startups access to vital resources and knowledge that otherwise would be out of reach. Together, we set up programs to help startups and partners discover new insights about how AI and robotics can transform industries like healthcare, agriculture, construction, transportation, and more.

However, the history of KEMET actually began a long time ago. Kemet Laboratories was established by Union Carbide Corporation in 1919 to purchase the Cooper Research Company of Cleveland, Ohio, which had invented a promising high-temperature alloy. The name ""KEMET"" is a blend of the words ""chemical"" and ""metallurgy."" KEMET's first product used this high-temperature alloy for grid wires in vacuum tubes. In 1930, the product line was expanded to include barium-aluminum alloy getters, an essential element in vacuum tubes. KEMET's development of automatic machinery allowed production of high-quality getters in the huge quantities needed to match the rapid expansion of vacuum tube usage. In fact, it is estimated that over 80% of the vacuum tubes used by the Allies during World War II contained KEMET getters. The business continued to grow and prosper until the early 1950s when Bell Telephone Laboratories invented the transistor. As the transistor began to displace vacuum tubes in electronics, the getter business stagnated. Fortunately for KEMET, Bell Laboratories had also invented the solid tantalum capacitor, which complemented the use of low-voltage transistors (semi-conductors) in electrical circuits. Since Union Carbide had experience in the fields of high-temperature metals and alloys, the solid tantalum capacitor was chosen as KEMET's ""new product"" to complement the getter product line and to provide the vehicle for future growth.","Consumer Electronics, Energy, Hardware, Manufacturing",1,Hugh S.
