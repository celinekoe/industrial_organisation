Our prediction is that by the end of this century, humans will engage in more conversations with sentient digital entities (AI) than with other humans. However, the current emotional technology fails to fulfill the fundamental human need for emotions. This is precisely where MetaSoul steps in to provide a solution. With fields as diverse as AI, metaverse, gaming, healthcare, and automotive, emotion synthesis is the ultimate upgrade for any product or service. In addition, the growing presence of AI, gaming, and virtual reality in society shows how critical and meaningful emotional interaction is to remove the barrier to widespread adoption. What sets EPU apart in the industry is that we're capable of generating any emotional state in an AI (LLM) from multimodal stimuli through wave computing. We also allow the AI to emotionally understand a situation by emotional reasoning and make a decision. Each unique MetaSoul (Persona) is linked to an EPUID to progress the development of its emotional personality over time, thanks to deep machine learning. MetaSoul’s breakthrough AI in advanced emotion synthesis dynamically layers emotion and empathy into any voice application and automated responses without the need for additional coding. Emotion synthesis technology not only controls voices but can also control the different facial micro expressions (FACS) and body languages of digital humans, robots, avatars, or NPC’s.’ faces in real-time using FACS What Make Us Unique MetaSoul holds a foundational patent family, granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, for perceiving and computing emotions in artificial intelligence (AI). Today, major tech companies in the US are using MetaSoul's technology when they deploy language and learning models (LLMs), as well as synthetic voices that can express dynamic tones, and life like avatars. As a result, MetaSoul has garnered significant attention.” Most of the AI research and innovation in this area has focused on detecting the emotional state by machine. Our unique, technology goes the next step by using AI to shape the machine’s cognitive appraisal and response, especially where voice and facial applications are involved. As a result, we are transforming the capabilities of Robots and AI, creating emotional states and synthetic emotion in for generative AI models. EPU is the industry’s first virtual emotion synthesis engine that delivers high performance machine emotion awareness. The EPU III family is transforming the capabilities of Robots and AI. MetaSoul has completed the deployment of the first EPU (emotional processing unit) in the cloud, a technology that creates emotional states and synthetic emotion in intelligent machines. The EPU is based on Patrick Levy-Rosenthal’s Psychobiotic Evolutionary Theory, extending Ekman’s theory by using twelve primary emotions identified in the psycho-evolutionary theory and pain/pleasure and frustration/satisfaction. Our revolutionary algorithms enable machines to respond to stimuli in line with one of the twelve primary emotions: anger, fear, sadness, disgust, indifference, regret, surprise, inattention, trust, confidence, desire, and joy. The Emotion recognition classifiers achieve more than 83 percent accuracy (ISEAR) on the conversation. The most innovative aspect of MetaSoul’ s emotion synthesis breakthrough is its real-time appraisal computation with reinforcement learning and Emotion Profile Graph (EPG) computation functionality allowing the AI or robot to experience 64 trillion possible distinct emotional states. Emotional stimuli are stored within the memory bank with their associated cognitive and physical state. The vEPU III has developed an EPG, which is used to register and develop over time a bank of emotional associations for each memory data within each intelligent machine. The EPG can communicate the data to other AI technologies to achieve a realistic range of expressions and interactions designed specifically for the user. The data allows the AI technologies to virtually understand/get to know the user and elicit the same emotional response. This technology allows an AI, robotic toy, or IoT device to develop a unique MBTI personality and emotion sensitivity (MetaSoul®) based on its user interactions and memories which will ultimately mean that no two have the exact same. Our emotion machine-learning cloud platform working with the EPU is built on years of research protected under issued patents for Special purpose processors (GPU). It becomes more emotionally intelligent with each interaction through symbolic reinforcement learning. In the near future, generative AI is poised to revolutionize the film industry by creating entire movies, going beyond just generating images or text. The demand for generative AI to produce synthetic emotions through character facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice, based on a deep understanding of the script and visual elements, will take center stage. MetaSoul, as the architect of emotion synthesis for AI, stands as the sole provider capable of offering a comprehensive solution in this domain.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Gaming, Media and Entertainment, Science and Engineering, Software",1,Patrick Levy Rosenthal,11-50,13,Seed,1570000,USD,1570000,1570000,USD,1570000,"Quake Capital Partners, Ascend Venture Capital, New Age Ventures, PAN Group Australia, Kathryn Stewart",1,5,,Private,,,,,,

Attracting top students from across the nation and more than 100 countries around the world, OU provides a major university experience in a private college atmosphere. OU is number one in the nation in the number of National Merit Scholars enrolled among public universities and is in the top ten of public universities in the nation in the graduation of Rhodes Scholars. The OU Honors College is one of the largest honors programs among public universities in the United States, matching the University’s best and brightest students with faculty in classrooms of 19 or fewer students. OU is one of the few public universities in the nation to cap the class size of first-year English composition courses at no more than 19. OU offers students the opportunity to study abroad in over 100 cities and 50 countries, including our signature program in Arezzo, Italy. The number of endowed faculty professorships and chaired positions has increased from less than 100 15 years ago to more than 560 today. This enables OU to keep and attract faculty researchers of national and international stature.    For four of the last six years the OU Debate team has won the National Debate Championship. Other students from across campus have worked in teams to also win top awards in the National Petroleum Engineering Competition, the National Kennedy Center Competition in Drama, and the entrepreneurship program consistently ranks in the top five nationally.   OU has emerged as a pacesetter for public higher education in the United States and is ranked by The Princeton Review among the top 10 public universities in the nation in terms of academic excellence and cost for students. OU has more than doubled the amount of private scholarships in five years and raised its scholarship goal to $250 million. In addition, OU’s private endowment has increased more than five-fold since 1994, growing from $204 million to more than $1.8 billion.    There is a true sense of family on the OU campus. Serving as a model for other public universities, OU established the Faculty-In-Residence program which places faculty members and their families in each of our residence halls to foster faculty and student interaction and encourage intergenerational friendships. Further, a different professor adopts each floor of the residence halls as well as each fraternity and sorority, allowing students and faculty to build relationships outside of the classroom.    OU’s Fred Jones Museum of Art ranks in the top 5 university art museums in the United States. It received the Weitzenhoffer Collection, the largest gift of French Impressionist art ever given to a public university in the US.

Its devices reduce healthcare costs and improve safety, quality, patient experience, and access to services around the globe. Invented by Dr. Tropello, CoapTech delivers a novel platform technology combining magnetic attraction for device placement guidance, and low-cost, point-of-care ultrasound for visual feedback in diagnostic, interventional, and therapeutic procedures. Strong rare-earth magnets are used to manually guide devices placed inside the human body, while real-time, low-cost ultrasound provides visual feedback to the clinician to ensure safety. This platform technology, invented by the company founder, has the potential to disrupt multiple medical procedures, substantially reducing costs while improving safety and patient experience. Their lead use case, selected because of its low risk, clear FDA pathway, and strong commercial viability, is for the insertion of gastrostomy tubes. They have defined the use of Coaptive Ultrasound to perform this novel gastrostomy procedure, as Percutaneous Ultrasound Gastrostomy (PUG). Briefly, PUG is a point-of-care (as opposed to the operating room) procedure for inserting gastrostomy tubes which can be quickly and easily performed by non-surgical providers.
