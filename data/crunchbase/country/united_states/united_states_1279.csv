OUR PRIORITIES Wysebridge’s management consists of founder Bryan Doreian, with continual input and oversight from a number of trusted and experienced mentors from diverse backgrounds (Academia, Scientific Research, Communications).  Before joining with these pioneers, Bryan spent most of his life studying, researching, and learning how to organize information while both working in the Drug Design industry and obtaining a PhD in Cellular Biophysics.  Because of this (and his partial OCD organizational tendencies), he is always thinking of better ways to present and assimilate data, in ways that well, are just easy to understand.  Because we’re a small company, literally every person who joins to study will be in touch with us from day one till they pass. WE UNDERSTAND The seemingly overwhelming task of studying for and passing this exam.  We’ve just gone through that process with you (in 2012!), and frankly, like many of you, were frustrated with the types of study materials out there, the general LACK of direct and honest talk about how to study for the exam (where to even begin, for example).  However, our years of experience in a wide variety of fields and industries allows us to communicate with you in ways that will be most effective for you.  IT’S PERSONAL What we like to do is create.  We’re all about innovation, improving, and designing.  Hey, we’re all in this patent world together, right?  Thus, what we decided to do is build upon known facts, our own experiences, and a little creativity, to enhance the studying process for you.  This whole concept was born through our own journey in passing the exam, but in actuality, our entire lives and experiences were preparing us for this moment when we could begin to help others pass this exam as well.",Education,1,Bryan Doreian,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
