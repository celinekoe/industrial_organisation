Platial users are interested in documenting their own travels as well as seeing those of other users. Platial's key feature is a map creation tool that lets anyone put locations markers over any point on the map they've visited and then annotate it with pictures and comments. A Google Adsense text advertisement appears on each annotation to match the context in each place. Users can tag each stop on their map as well as see other users that have been there. Clicking on a Tag will take you to a menu of other destinations with similar features. Clicking on another user who has been to any given location will take you to his/her map that shares that location. By networking this way, users can uncover the best places to go in any region quickly and easily. Google maps has less functionality than Platial, yet now allows users to create custom/sharable maps.
