Curated News is a news aggregation platform that provides misinformation proof news at a fraction of the cost of major companies, like Facebook, strengthening user information consumption habits without compromising democratic values. Why do we need it? News revenue strategies rely on ad-tracking technologies to serve you content to increase ratings. Scandalous stories centered on outrage have been shown to increase user activity and ratings, deepening the cycle of misinformation. Who is it for? News is the primary mechanism people use to drive their daily decisions. Information quality is of the utmost importance for those who want to make high quality decisions, including consumers who want to get quality information faster. What makes it stand out from the crowd? There are currently no secure news aggregators that utilize the statistical methodology Curated News employs. Furthermore, there are no platforms that serve high quality information content while simultaneously producing democratic values. What’s next? Curated News has looked to expand its statistical methodology to information drivers outside traditional news-focused areas, including medical study information, providing a “channel” where you can see the wide application of its method.","Content and Publishing, Information Technology, Media and Entertainment",1,Matthew Benchimol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Oftentimes, the only alternatives are surgical headlights, which cause headaches and necks trains, which obviously are not ideal operating conditions. Insufficient lighting contributes to the $1.5 Billion annual cost surgical errors inflict upon the U.S.  healthcare system. That is why they designed the SurgiLight lighting system, which provides surgeons with a simple, high quality illumination source for deep cavity surgical procedures.  It connects to existing overhead lights, and features a long, flexible cable that will allow the user to direct the light into the cavity from any desired angle. This unique LED device delivers a bright and localized light without the burden of heavy headlamps and wired systems, and allows View Medical to offer hospitals a cost effective way to improve patient outcomes.","Hardware, Health Care",3,"Jack Ratcliffe, John Ratcliffe, Simren Dhaliwal",1-10,1,Seed,100000,USD,100000,100000,USD,100000,"Innova Memphis, MB Venture Partners, ZeroTo510",,3,,Private,,,,,,
