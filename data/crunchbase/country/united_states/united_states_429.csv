Their proprietary digital mobile media platform consists of a social network community that leverages their ability to more efficiently deliver any form of digital content (including streaming video) to virtually every mobile user worldwide regardless of their device, network or carrier. The technological limitation of 90% of the handsets in use today combined with the complications and expense of reaching users through carriers and aggregators has stunted the growth of mobile devices being used as a medium for content delivery.   Recognizing this disconnect, Uronimo spent over two (2) years developing an innovative mobile messaging platform that enables users to send and receive any form of digital content including:  video, images, MP3s, etc.  This platformâ€™s architecture not only solves the issues plaguing every other mobile content delivery provider, but also achieves their primary objective of enhancing the mobile user experience by being: Uronimoâ€™s technology platform is completely proprietary and only contains source code that has been developed in-house from the ground up.  The fundamental architecture of the Companyâ€™s technology is based on Linux and the software has been developed with scalabilty in mind, both from a technical and licensing standpoint.  The platform has not used any software that would require expensive licensing as the system grows and each component of the system (Messaging, Media transcoding, serving, WAP server, data store, Web servers, etc.) has the ability to scale by simply adding more computers to each cluster of components as the load increases. Since Uronimo is in complete control of its technology, it can ensure proper integration with any third party vendor technology should a certain application require additional functionality not currently developed.  Therefore, Uronimo has the flexibility to evaluate a â€œBuild vs. Buyâ€ strategy as it relates to any of the future functionality currently identified on our product roadmap.","Mobile, Software",1,Robert Salinas,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
