You allow us to provide tools to  further success, encourage expression, and create an equal education for all students.” For every purchased box one will be donated to a Nigerian Student in Africa.   Our funding priority is school supplies for youth education up to college, specifically in the following areas  STEM. The emphasis is on increasing student achievement in STEM  science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and literacy at the end of the school year a  college scholarship will be giving to One Student in America and one student in Nigeria.   We created Mitch School Box Club as a non-for-profit so that not only is it a one-stop shopping portal for your back-to-school supplies and educational enrichment supplies, but a means by which WE collectively can help those children who need most support.  It will be donated to a disadvantaged child in your community.   ​ Our Focus Mitch School Box Club Foundation tackles critical problems primarily affecting the United States and Nigeria Africa for the  poor and disadvantaged, and supports strong and effective partner organizations to do the same. We believe that good stewardship means maximizing our resources, including grant funding and staff time, while building strong partnerships based on trust.  Students When families can barely afford rent and groceries, school supplies just can’t be a priority. For these students struggling with extreme poverty, and to provide distressed communities and disadvantaged students we can offer school supplies. We serve kids at schools where at least 70% of students are enrolled in the federal free or reduced lunch program. We do this through our National Network of Resource Centers and our School Ready Supplies program.  Teachers On average, teachers spend $578 per year from their own pockets on school supplies for their classrooms. That’s why we offer 40 Resource Centers across the country where teachers can go to obtain free school supplies. We also offer Teacher Supply Boxes provide successful applicants with two boxes containing roughly $500 in the most essential school supplies — from notebooks and markers to pens and glue. ​ Education A solid foundation in education is key to success later in life. Your donations fund teachers, books and extracurricular activities to help get youngsters off to the right start. This will also help us support every School in America with a strong S.T.E.M Program in there school which will also help our overseas schools in Nigeria. Community Community is the family that goes beyond family. It is the people and places that we come in contact with each and every day. When we strengthen communities, we strengthen individuals.

Famous venture capitalist Guy Kawasaki said in his book, The Art of the Start, â€œOf the effort you put into write a business plan, 80 percent should go into the executive summary.  These are the most important paragraphs of your organizationâ€:tm:s existence.â€ Big Problem - The Angel Capital Association estimates that only 1 to 4% of start-ups applying for angel investment make it through the entire process to successfully raise capital.  With such a low success rate many entrepreneurs seek high-priced consultants to write their business plan for them.  The problem is the ACEF strongly recommends that the business owner write the business plan when applying for angel investment -- no consultants.  How can a software developer or an engineer with no business plan writing experience possibly compete? Unique Solution - The ExecutivePlan is the worldâ€:tm:s leading online authority in providing entrepreneurs with assistance in the process of writing business plan executive summaries.  We provide free guides, templates, videos and articles to help entrepreneurs write powerful executive summaries. The Opportunity - According to the ACEF only 1 in 4 that submit an executive summary to an angel investor will  successfully make it to the next round.  This means that 75% of entrepreneurs seeking angel investment capital need assistance in writing a more powerful, more effective and more memorable executive summary.  Each month Google receives the following number of queries for our relevant keywords:     * How to Write an Executive Summary - 9,900 per month     * Write Executive Summary - 18,100 per month Why the ExecutivePlan - As Kawasaki stated, 80% of the entrepreneurs effort should go toward writing an executive summary, and yet startups spend precious cash on business plan consultants.  Now entrepreneurs can write their own business plan, and then simply engage with the ExecutivePlan for content, advice, and consulting services to create an incredible executive summary.  After you get in the door with bankers and investors, your management team, your financials, and your presentation skills will seal the deal.","Education, Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Professional Services",1,Adam Hoeksema,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

As a valuation expert and founder of Pellegrino & Associates, Mike has worked for over a decade with some of the world’s largest companies across every major industry sector. He experienced firsthand the lack of integrated service platforms in the IP market that generate analysis at the business strategy level. As a result, he came up with the idea of IP Software to alleviate the time and expense spent on IP research, provide easier access to IP information, maximize the leverage IP owners can extract from their assets, and enable business strategy decisions. He saw this as a great opportunity to offer products that combine his IP valuation experience with IP analytical tools.
