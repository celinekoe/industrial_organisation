Among those initial supporters were the founding Board of Director members and Advisory Board members : Dave Almstead, Megan Dowdy, Alan Fidelo, Mike Foristall, Alan Gooch, Joe Hornstein, Jeff Lagos, George Lamelza, Joe Mckinney, Mack Mclaughlin, Alan Morrison, and Scott Rose. As this idea was forming, Laura Goldstein — a strong, early advocate of the game — was diagnosed with stage IV metastatic breast cancer. This unfortunate event inspired the initial Board of Directors to choose breast cancer research toward finding a cure as its charitable funding focus. Board members knew that each college bowl game donates to a charity. However, most fans are unaware of which charitable causes are being supported. To separate this bowl from the rest, they wanted to give the public the chance to support the game as well as a significant cause. To do this it was decided the cause would be permanently incorporated into the game title. As a result, the Cure Bowl was born. Unfortunately, Laura Goldstein will not be able to experience the bowl game that she helped inspire. She lost her long and hard fought battle with breast cancer on April 20, 2011. Another devastating loss hit close to home when on March 24, 2015, OSF Board CFO Sandi Breitenstein passed away from stage IV liver cancer. Laura, Sandi and others who will lose their battle against cancer today, tomorrow, and the days to come continue to motivate OSF to make the AutoNation Cure Bowl presented by Florida Hospital a success.",Health Care,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

That's a quick way to give your account some content vs. having to post links manually on Twitter (lkliey requiring you to first learn to use something like TinyURL).Also if you opt for Twitter first you need to learn how to compose your thoughts in 144 characters which some might consider frustrating.I know I sometimes feel like I'm talking to nobody when I write @replies on Twitter because you can't always expect a response.  On Friendfeed if you encounter any topic you're interested in, you're free to comment and you can count on more that just the author reading it in most cases.  I think, in general, Twitter is more about broadcasting where Friendfeed is more about content discussion which gives the latter the edge in engaging new users.Maybe I haven't been as caught up in the Twitter community as you, Rob, but I think that Friendfeed offers many fewer barriers to entry.  Either way, they're both very interesting to read.","Clothing and Apparel, Design, Media and Entertainment, Professional Services, Video",1,Jeffrey Guy Tunches,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
