Yes, but not in a traditional way. Their long term projects , based on the children's interests, will allow children to tinker with science concepts and art mediums that will help them to learn shapes, color, symmetry, art skills and the ability to notice details. At the same time the teachers will guide them through related math, literacy, storytelling, poetry, singing, dancing and music on a global level. They will offer yoga, private piano lessons, violin lessons and a foreign language immersion program which teaches Spanish, French, Mandarin, and Hebrew through live music and puppetry. Their school is reflective of the progressive philosophy of Reggio Emilia. CNN has noted this approach as the """"world's best pre-school model"""". On weekends they'll offer Mommy and Me classes, birthday parties, and special events such as puppet shows.     Their target market- families with household incomes between $100,000 -$250,000+ .
