Polymersomes are nanovesicles (“hollow sacks”) that are comprised entirely of FDA-approved biodegradable polymers that spontaneously self-assemble in water. Compared to other nanocarriers, polymersomes have several distinct advantages including larger loading capacities and superior formulation stabilities. As such, polymersomes are particularly useful for the stable encapsulation of both water-soluble and insoluble agents, in high concentration, without the need for chemical modification of their cargo. They have successfully been used to deliver a wide variety of agents, including small molecules, peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Further, polymersomes’ unique structural properties enable specific delivery to target sites without concomitant loss of their cargo due to premature breakdown after prolonged shelf-storage or in high shear flow, in vivo vascular environments.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",,,1-10,1,,1285000,USD,1285000,1285000,USD,1285000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The communications equipment division, operating under Corvis Equipment Corporation, designs, manufactures, and sells high performance all-optical and electrical/optical communications systems. In response to the severe downturn in the telecommunications industry, the company shifted its focus to become primarily a provider of communications services, which comprises about 99 percent of its revenue. In 2003, Cincinnati Bell reclaimed its former name, selling its competitive carrier operations—Broadwing—to equipment manufacturer Corvis. In 2004, Corvis acquired Focal Communications, folded Focal into Broadwing Communications’ operations, and used that opportunity to change the name of Broadwing Communications’ parent company from Corvis Corporation to Broadwing Corporation. On October 16, 2006, Broadwing Corporation announced an agreement to be acquired by Level 3 Communications, and the deal to close in the first quarter of 2007.","Hardware, Software",1,Moïse AUGIS,1001-5000,1,M&A,,USD,,,USD,,New Enterprise Associates,,1,3,Private,,,,,,

We like affordability, but we’re not sold on compromises. They’re what separates common from extraordinary—an important distinction we’re sure you’ll know when you see it. Some call us control freaks (they’re not wrong), but we think covering all the bases is what sets us apart from the pack. Only great materials make great products, so we source our own and we design every piece from scratch. We know a supply chain shouldn’t cut corners, so we steer the ship ourselves and provide a new level of quality at a price worthy of a double-take. And as a guest in your home, we know that customers are as good as family, so we bring our best table manners everywhere we go. As certified homebodies we also believe we’re citizens of the globe. We’re passionate about making our collective home a better place to live, so we partner with like-minded do-gooders to help build resources like homes and schools for communities in need. With every Sixpenny purchase, we donate 6% of our proceeds to the community-building project of your choice.
