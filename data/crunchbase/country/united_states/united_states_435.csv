No matter how bizarre your interests may be, you’ll never run out of things to do at Swarthmore. In terms of financial aid, Swarthmore pledges to meet 100% of demonstrated need. The college determines your ability to pay based on a combination of your expected contribution and your parents’ expected contribution. State and federal grants are the primary source of financial assistance, but roughly half of Swarthmore students also receive institutional scholarships. Swarthmore’s admissions are among the most selective of any liberal arts college. If you want to increase your chances, it’s a good idea to schedule an interview.
