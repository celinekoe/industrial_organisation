Reminiscent of a high alpine meadow we are truly the sweet spot that connects the Silicon Valley to the beaches of Santa Cruz. Here the back drop is always lush green, surrounded by fresh air, whispering pines, puffy white clouds, and crystal blues skies. Scotts Valley was named after Hiram D. Scott who moved here from Maine in 1850. He purchased 4,436 acres known as the San Augustine Rancho and the seaman that turned gold miner decided to try his hand at ranching. Immediately he sent for his relatives which were the only inhabitants of this stunning landscape through the 1850?s. At that time horses and cattle roamed the countryside and all the suitable land for farming produced grain. The land was abundant with wildlife. Apparently there was a serious population of grizzly bears and deer but it was said that the quail were numberless. Today many of the lush green pastures still remain as open space where horses are free to roam and feed. Scotts Valley?s low elevation of 561ft provides us with the luxury of a moderate Mediterranean climate. This probably explains the considerable number of people out enjoying a walk, jogging, or cycling through the streets and neighborhoods in Scotts Valley. Many people are initially drawn to Scotts Valley for our excellent schools or wanting a prime commute location but probably if you polled the residents they would say they were searching more for a lifestyle than locale. The people here are honest, friendly, and kind. I think we have the best of what a small town has to offer, safety, freedom from congestion, and strong neighborhood connections. The people of Scotts Valley have relationships with their neighbors that create life long bonds.","Community and Lifestyle, Real Estate, Travel and Tourism",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
