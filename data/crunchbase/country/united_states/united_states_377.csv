As the name implies, ThreadThat.com is built around the concept that conversations that take place over time can be organized into Threads. As the FAQ for ThreadThat.com explains, all messages and files are protected from accidental discovery using AES 256-bit encryption while in-transit between the browser and web server and while at-rest on the database server.  The site offers two levels of privacy - confidential and secret.  The later requires the use of passkeys to protect thread content.  A proprietary passkey manager is built in to make the use of passkeys less objectionable.  Passkeys can be communicated to recipients using unsecured email without compromising security since those recipients must log into their account before they can access any threads. Any email account(s) users own can be used with ThreadThat.com.  The private content of threads is never transmitted or stored unencrypted.  Only notifications of new and updated threads are sent via email.  Threads are addressed just like email and can be sent to anyone even if they do not have a ThreadThat account.  Notification emails are automatically sent addressed from you and addressed to each recipient individually.  If you address a thread to 10 people, ThreadThat.com sends 10 emails - one to each recipient email address.  All recipients are required to create an account using their respective email addresses before they can access your threads unless the Untrusted privacy level is used.  Untrusted Threads allow read and reply access to anyone with a link to the Thread.  This option may appeal to business users that realize how difficult it is to get clients to create an account of any kind. Some of the security features in ThreadThat.com are: * Secure Login (optional multifactor authentication) * Email account verification (for proof of identity) * New IP address detection (email/SMS challenge to prevent unauthorized account use) * Multiple session detection (concurrent logins from multiple locations not allowed) * Session timeout (automatic logoff after specified amount of time) Some security features can be disabled or customized in user preferences. Other features in ThreadThat.com include: * Multifactor Authentication using any mobile phone * Unlimited attachments of up to 100M each * Unlimited confidential and secret threads * Anonymous accounts (TT can hide your email address) * Delete messages and users from any thread you own * Prevent recipients from inviting others to your threads * ""Read Only"" threads * Rich text controls to format thread content * Automatic notifications to email and/or mobile device * Notification template for new thread notifications * Self maintaining address book * Passkey manager * Instant account and thread deletion You can register all of your email addresses in one ThreadThat account.  You can then select any email address you own for your thread notifications.  This allows you to use a single ThreadThat account for communicating with family, friends, co-workers and clients. This site was developed using Microsoft ASP.NET 3.5 and SQL Server 2012, Telerik ASP.NET Ajax toolkit, Ajax Uploader ASP.NET Upload component and wodCrypt Active X Component (uses OPENSSL).
