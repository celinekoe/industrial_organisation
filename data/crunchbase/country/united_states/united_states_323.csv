It was suggested that the original photo was photoshopped, so a few videos were posted on [YouTube](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/youtube).

She looks similar to a Ragdoll or Snowshoe, but there have never been any of that breed around the house. Her mom is a calico domestic short hair cat and her father has grey and white stripes. Grumpy Cat’s petite size and famous face is likely due to feline dwarfism and her rear end wobbles a bit when she walks due to this. Being a normal kitty most of the time, Grumpy Cat plays, hides, and acts as cats act. She loves to hide behind the curtains. She isn’t in front of a camera all of the time like many people perceives.

In addition to offering residencies to soon-to-be doctors in such areas as Emergency Medicine, Ophthalmology and Dermatology, St. Francis trains and educates future nurses and radiological professionals.  In addition to a two-year RN program, St. Francis offers an LPN to RN bridge program, which is designed for licensed practical nurses who would like to become registered nurses.  The advanced technology found at St. Francis give students in all programs the chance to get hands-on training for their chosen profession with all the current tools of the trade.  A Catholic organization, St. Francis Medical Center also promotes the idea of compassionate loving service to patients. This mindset is integrated into the student curriculum and is also the reason for St. Francis’ community outreach activities.  Admissions requirements differ depending on the program. Admission to the nursing program, for example, requires a high school diploma or GED, submission of transcripts, three recommendation letters and a passing score on the Test of Essential Academic Skills (TEAS). Students increase the likelihood of acceptance if they have an academic background in such subjects as Anatomy and Physiology.  Pell grants, loans and private scholarships are also possible sources of financial aid that students may receive to help with tuition costs.
