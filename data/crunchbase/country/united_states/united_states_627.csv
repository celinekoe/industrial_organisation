Studies show that 4 out of 5 college students consume beer on a regular basis with the average student drinking 48.3 gallons annually. With over 21 million students currently enrolled in US colleges there is a huge opportunity to introduce homebrewing into an untapped college market.  In 2012, homebrewing generated over $1 billion in annual economic activity, growing at over 20 percent a year. Most of this new growth comes from young adults who are introduced to the DIY brewing craze, yet no one is targeting the enormous beer brazen college market. The perception is that homebrewing is a complicated and expensive hobby. Without any clear direction many would-be brewers are intimidated and give up before they even start. Many that do try homebrewing end up wasting hundreds of dollars on unnecessary equipment, ending up with bad beer. That's a problem…and an opportunity.   That's where College Brewer comes in.  We've simplified homebrewing. Everything has been broken down into the basics so that brewing your own beer is an easy-to-learn and fulfilling hobby. Between our online support, easy to follow instructions, and video database you'll never be stranded without an answer. And not only that, we've made everything affordable. College students are on a budget. Understandable considering they’re entering what is possibly the most debt ridden portion of their life. We’ve developed Brew Kits that allow brewers to make their own beer at college without breaking the bank.  To reach this goal College Brewer is seeking $50,000 in equity investment to fund the business start-up.","Commerce and Shopping, Education, Internet Services, Other, Social Impact",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
