Currently, patients use search engines, databases or referrals to find practitioners, but this approach is still a ""shot in the dark""​. Practitioners: A top pain point of practitioners is marketing their services, which require time, resources and expertise they don’t have. Currently, practitioners list and advertise their services and network when possible. These tactics are highly stressful and often unfruitful efforts.  SOLUTION Wellacopia is a compatibility matching platform that uses the proven concept of online dating to help patients find their ideal healthcare partner.  For practitioners, it is a comprehensive marketing platform that provides them with customizable profiles (i.e. advertisements), customer vetting (i.e. lead generation), and it is the only healthcare platform to allow practitioners to reach out to patients first because of the matching transparency on both sides (i.e. sales). ADVANTAGE Wellacopia is the 1st platform to use relationship preferences as criteria for matching in healthcare, plus we have made sure to incorporate the other necessary conveniences provided by existing platforms.  We understand the priority of compatibility and trust in successful healthcare. Our competitors were born out of the need to increase volumes (i.e. appointments).
