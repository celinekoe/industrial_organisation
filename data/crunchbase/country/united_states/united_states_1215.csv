The first is clunky tools obviously built by someone who has never lifted furniture.

It should look and feel as easy to use as the rest of the software that powers their daily lives. At MoveTech, they believe it is possible to build software that is not only functional, but is actually a pleasure to use. The second kind of software they’ve found is the same paper documents movers have filled out for decades, just on a computer or tablet.
