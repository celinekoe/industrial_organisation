Co-founded by Soraya Darabi (Foodspotting; The New York Times) and Maxine Bédat (The Bootstrap Project), Zady is a New York-based e-commerce brand that will provide customers with information about the conscious consumer movement and the option to purchase beautifully-constructed goods on its website, and later, its iPad application. The items available for purchase were created with craftsmanship and artisanship, qualities that have been sacrificed in a world of cheap prices and fast production.  Just as Whole Foods sparked a movement based on the belief that consumers should question where food comes from, Zady is creating a new vision for shopping and is at the forefront of conscious consumerism, which demands transparency for sourced products. Manufacturing transparency is at the heart of Zady; every item sold is from a designer who is conscious of where and how their products are made. Each product is personally vetted by Zady’s founders, using criteria for sustainability, including whether the product is locally-sourced, handmade, uses high-quality raw materials, is environmentally-conscious, or made in the U.S.A. The brands are required to sign a contract verifying the location of the company, the manufacturing city, and the source of the raw materials. However, consumers won’t need to compromise style for a clear conscience. All products sold on Zady are high-quality, timeless in style, and are build to last, withstanding fleeting seasonal trends and the short life-spans of poorly-made “fast fashion” items.  As such, Zady will be the arbiter of authenticity-meets-taste for this generation of conscious consumers.","Clothing and Apparel, Commerce and Shopping, Design, Transportation",2,"Maxine Bédat, Soraya Darabi",11-50,2,,,USD,,1350000,USD,1350000,"New Enterprise Associates, VTF Capital, Andrew Ferenci",1,3,,Private,,,,,,
