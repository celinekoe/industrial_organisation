The website is divided into 3 targeted sections: Articles, Blogs, and Model Mentors. The ""Articles"" section provides straightforward information regarding the modeling industry. It is unbiased and factual; the articles are concerned with the information offered within and nothing more. The ""Blog"" section differs greatly in that regard. The blogs written on ModelMentors.com are penned by professional models seeking to educate and inform; using their experience and personality as a direct way to emotionally connect with their audience at the same time. These Blogs appear to aim at supplementing the typical method by which models can find information online (that being rather impersonally; often relying on results from a search engine that feature advice from unidentified, yet self-proclaimed authorities). The Blogs are uncensored, and they revolve around the trials and tribulations of seasoned, successful, and respected models. This can potentially provide a much greater sense of understanding than a typical Google search may offer. The ""Model Mentors"" section allows its readers/""Mentees"" the opportunity to personally connect with, and learn from, a team of established, successful, and professional models. The featured ""Model Mentors"" all have lengthy resumes and an abundance of credits and accomplishments to their respective names. The Mentoring sessions offer a 1-on-1, 60-minute, private video conference- exclusively between mentee/mentor. This is the mentee's chance to directly ask their mentor for guidance, advice, recommendations, warnings, industry contacts, connections, and more. This is a personalized experience, as-yet-unseen on current ""modeling advice"" internet offerings. Whereas once the Mentees may not have been able to get in contact with the models that inspire them- let alone speak face-to-face regardless of geographic considerations, these barriers no longer exist with the launch of ModelMentors.com.

The firm’s investment vehicles and separate accounts (SMAs) focus on publicly traded U.S. equities. It employs a market neutral approach and a long/short equity strategy to invest in undervalued stocks of companies, while focusing equally on flawed companies to engage in short sales.  The firm utilizes fundamental analysis to generate a bottom up stock picking approach for constructing its portfolios. Willow Creek Capital Partners L.P. was founded in April 1995 and is based in Greenbrae, California. Their decades-long track record of success has enabled the company to work with dozens of inspiring investors and business-builders during Willow Creek Capital Partners, L.P.’s existence.  This company works to identify, invest in companies that are undervalued, often due to investor disinterest/neglect, frequently due to the investing public’s lack of understanding about a business or its industry dynamics. This investment approach is based on a disciplined process that measures risk (downside) while identifying the catalysts for increasing value. To achieve transformative results, Willow Creek Capital Management purposefully engages only in friendly transactions and works with talented management teams. Given the hundreds of companies analyzed during its history, Willow Creek Capital Partners, L.P. strives to assist companies it is considering making an investment in by offering suggestions for improving results across varied elements of a business’s operations thereby attempting to help to maximize value. Willow Creek Capital Partners, L.P. draws on the skills and experience of its employees, consulting relationships and other like-minded investors.  The company’s main objective is to deliver superior long-term and risk-adjusted performance through investing in undervalued stocks of small-cap and mid-cap companies to construct its equity portfolios, while always maintaining a robust portfolio of fundamentally flawed short positions. Central to Willow Creek Capital Partners, L.P.’s investment philosophy is a rigorous process of fundamental research which includes meeting with company management, as well as analysis of publicly available information and proprietary and independent research. This firm invests in a diverse range of markets and uses a wide variety of investment styles and financial instruments to accomplish their goals. This investment flexibility unlocks unique opportunities for its investment vehicles and SMAs.  Willow Creek Capital Partners, L.P. has established a formal governing process and an efficient operational structure – utilizing “outsourcing” of all non-investment functions whenever possible --  to maximize efficiency. The company also benefits from the long-term relationships they have built with a number of reputable service providers that specialize in fund accounting and administration, securities laws and regulations, audit and tax, and technology. Willow Creek Capital Partners L.P. believes that over time this approach should deliver additive risk-adjusted performance as we strive to identify and invest in the great companies that have the potential to appreciate significantly and continue to find short opportunities where the companies are very likely to fail and cease to exist.
