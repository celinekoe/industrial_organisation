Seemingly in their own world of superheroes and intergalactic battles. They have been captivated by Star Wars for quite a long time and probably since they were in diapers.  When they started college, they had the idea of going into animation so they can create their own epic superhero story. Unfortunately, the real world and the potential to earn big bucks swayed them in a different direction. After years of “routine” work, they explored ways to show and share their passions, and ZIA Sabers was born. Overview ZIA replica lightsabers offer all the fun and effects of a ""real"" lightsaber without the risks. A custom lightsaber from ZIA Sabers starts at around $100. From hilt design to blade color, one can create the perfect lightsaber replica for display or as a dueling weapon for battling friends from the dark side.

Appointment Scheduling soon followed based on the needs described by their customers. In 1992, through a collaboration with one of their Allergist customers, they created the roots of their current Allergy Lab System.  In 1993 they created the original version of their Electronic Medical Records application. In these early years, all of their applications were written for the ubiquitous “green screen” terminal. As PCs began to replace terminals in the mid-to-late 90s, a Terminal Emulator replaced an actual terminal. In 1996 they hired their first Visual Basic programmer. This began the eventual conversion of all Mountainside applications to the current Windows user experience. Throughout their history, Mountainside has worked closely with both new and existing customers to modify and enhance all of their applications to meet the needs of a wide variety of medical offices.  They recognize that no two offices are exactly alike, and that each specialty has specific requirements. By employing a set of “how should Mountainside work for you” setup questions, each site may be uniquely configured to meet their specific needs. They believe that (within reason) software should conform to you, not you to the software.",Software,,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Created to advance the state of cybersecurity, protect critical infrastructures, and improve the resilience of open-source software (applications, libraries, etc.), the ultimate goal of the SWAMP is to provide higher quality and more secure software for government agencies, businesses, academia, and end users. The SWAMP was developed to lower the barriers for software and tool developers, researchers, and educators/students (Audience/User Groups) to do continuous software assurance. By offering multiple software analysis tools and a library of software applications with known vulnerabilities, the SWAMP is committed to making it easier to integrate security into the software development life cycle. There are two ways to use the SWAMP: the ready-to-use cloud computing platform at mir-swamp.org and the SWAMP-in-a-Box (SiB) open-source distribution downloadable from GitHub. The SWAMP (mir-swamp.org) went live in February 2014 and is hosted at the Morgridge Institute for Research in Madison, Wisconsin. This shared, secure facility offers advanced networking capabilities and robust hardware to meet the continuous assurance needs of multiple software and tool development projects. Coupled with HTCondor, an open-source workload scheduling and compute management system, the SWAMP provides a powerful and easy-to-use environment to support high-volume continuous software assurance across a broad set of platforms that are embedded in a distributed environment. They provide an environment that enables run isolation and additional platform version choices. These machines are provisioned in a flexible, secure network setting that provides unique configurations to support and scale to meet the needs of the most demanding testing scenarios. Since software security testing requires the use of multiple tools to perform a comprehensive analysis, the SWAMP hosts a wide library of both commercial and open-source assurance tools to enable software projects of any size to be thoroughly and quickly tested for weaknesses. The SWAMP provides access to an integrated results viewer that compiles and prioritizes all of the test results into one central platform. This allows users to easily visualize the detected security weaknesses from all of the tools used and quickly remediate the most critical defects. By incorporating the SWAMP into the software development life cycle, it is easier to find vulnerabilities before that software is deployed for use or released to the public.","Information Technology, Privacy and Security, Software",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

In 2017, Clearwater Properties was named one of America's Best Brokerages by The Land Report. At Clearwater, we focus on providing quality customer service, superior market knowledge, and giving back to the communities we serve. Clearwater understands that above all in selling property, it’s about maximum exposure. We pride ourselves in being on the cutting edge of technology, marketing strategies, and trends, with special expertise in the ranch, farm and recreational sectors of the real estate industry. We are active in 9 Montana multiple listing services (more than any other brokerage in the state). And, as top Sports Afield Trophy Properties brokerage in the world, we gain worldwide exposure for our clients' listings.

To that end, Clearwater Agents and Owners are proud to give back a portion of all real estate proceeds to the local communities in which they are earned. We take pride in working to make our communities better, and helping to strengthen civic and charitable organizations, while maintaining our deep commitment to the lands we serve. Whether you are looking to buy or sell, the common traits you will find in all Clearwater Team Members are high levels of character and integrity.
