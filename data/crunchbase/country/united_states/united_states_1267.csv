Happy Joe's,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/happy-joes,"Food and Beverage, Restaurants","Bettendorf, Iowa, United States","Originator of the taco pizza, Happy Joe's is a family-friendly American pizza and ice cream restaurant.","299,333",Midwestern US,$1M to $10M,Active,1972-11-16,day,,,,,For Profit,https://happyjoes.com/,"Founded in 1972 in Bettendorf, Iowa, by a one-time Shakey's Pizza manager, Lawrence Joseph ""Happy Joe"" Whitty, the chain has, from its beginning, been known for innovation. Whitty was disciplined by his former employer for hosting a children's birthday party at the pizza restaurant. Once he opened the first Happy Joe's location, by contrast, such parties were not only encouraged but celebrated in epic fashion. Whitty's unique vision fueled the company's expansion in the midwestern and southern United States, as well as opening a Happy Joe's boat-shaped restaurant on the Nile River in Egypt during the 1980s. He related that, in the early days, a couple who had had fun at a birthday party asked about investing in a franchise. At the time, he said, he knew nothing about how to make that happen and had never really intended to expand. But expand he did. The chain took form as a combination pizza parlor and ice cream palace, known Whitty also claimed credit for inventing the chain's best-selling product -- The Taco Pizza. In 2005, Happy Joe's began serving breakfast pizza at select locations, and in 2013 it debuted a flatbread pizza. Shortly after that, Whitty's company introduced a second concept restaurant known as Happy Joe's Pizza Grille, with a limited buffet format. In addition to signature pizzas, diners are able to order traditional American fare that now includes a selection of tasty appetizers, pasta, popular sandwiches, gourmet salads, dessert pizzas, hand-dipped ice cream cones, and other family favorites. Happy Joe's continues to focus on fun and family connections and is committed to causes that benefit children, as it has been since its founding. Today, Happy Joe's embraces new technology and has faced major challenges during the COVID pandemic, but still offers a family-friendly experience that emphasizes fun as well as good food. Happy Joe's is one of only a handful of worldwide brands that connect emotionally with its guests. A very different type of pizza brand; at Happy Joe’s, pizza dough is a blank canvas. There are no restrictions to pizza toppings based on preconceived norms.  Very few restaurant brands can celebrate 50 years in business. Even fewer are true to the vision held by their founders. But this pizza (and more) chain epitomizes the ""can do"" spirit that led to its initial success. A Happy Joe's location in Dubuque, Iowa, and the original Bettendorf location continue to lead the chain year in and year out in sales and guest counts. They both offer consistently excellent food, great value for the dollar, are heavily involved in their local community, and operate with a Servant's Heart, Warrior Spirit, and are passionate about their business. One of the founder's annual practices was to close each location one day a year and invite children with special needs for a party. He also encouraged his franchisees to hire workers with special needs or disabilities. And he established the Happy Joe's Kids Foundation, which focuses on outreach to children with special needs. Its work continues to this day. Happy Joe’s focuses on family connections and being the place to celebrate any family event. Whether it’s a school or community group event, Happy Joe’s creates lifelong magical memories for its guests. Happy Joe's has been serving America's two favorite foods -- pizza and ice cream -- for five decades, bringing smiles to the faces of countless families. Over the past 18 months, Happy Joe's has signed more franchise agreements and opened more new locations than during the past decade, pointing to the fact that Americans are hungry for good times in a family-friendly environment. The chain has also attracted attention in the industry and has been named a QSR (Quick Service Restaurant) ""Top 50"" Contender, a FastCasual ""Top 200"" concept, a ""Top 400"" business by Franchise Times, and a ""Top 500"" restaurant by Nation's Restaurant News. That's not a bad record for a chain begun on a shoestring budget by a man who just wanted to have some fun by serving unique pizzas and ice cream at children's birthday parties.",Food and Beverage,1,Lawrence Joseph Whitty,101-250,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
