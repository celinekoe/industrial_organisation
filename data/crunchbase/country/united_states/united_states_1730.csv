Paying $4-$5 for a pack of Pokemon Cards is just too much and is not affordable for many players and families.  That’s why at Pokenerds we do something called Pokemon Card Breaks. What is a Pokemon Card Break? A Pokemon Card Break is when instead of just buying a pack, or an entire box of packs, you only purchase the ""type"" of cards you're interested in. For example, if you want to build a water deck and you're only interested in ""water type"" cards, we will open every single pack in the box/case and you get to keep ALL of the ""water"" type cards from the 36 packs per box! Instead of getting stuck paying for a lot of cards you don't really want or need.
