Since those early days, their product line has greatly expanded. They now offer wiring harnesses and controllers for all types of vehicles, from jeeps to motorcycles. They also offer other manufacturers' high-quality products such as Spal fans, BeCool radiators, and ididit steering columns. Today, they stick to the principles that they built this business on: they believe in providing safe, high-quality products that are easy to install and do what you need them to do. Their kits are built to last. Centech, Inc. goes to extremes to use the best materials available to manufacture their wiring kits. They use materials manufactured in the United States. You may find some items which are assembled outside this country, but they are in the minority. They use color-coded, high temperature Cross-Link SAE J-1128 Type GXL and SXL wire in all their kits. They label the wire every few inches to help you identify each wire. This wire is designed to operate at 275 degrees. That means that this wire can still work at full capacity even when it is used inside the engine compartment. It is resistant to oil, gasoline, anti-freeze, and other substances. Many competitors use less expensive, low temperature PVC wire to reduce their cost.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Manufacturing",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
