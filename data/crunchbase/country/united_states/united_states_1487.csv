A majority of these stations are nearing the end of their life expectancy and reliability issues are increasing.  As the the state grows, the electricity demand will increase.  This will place even heavier loads on the existing stations. Their goal is to supplement and fill the gaps when existing stations fail or have lengthy outages with clean solar power.  In addition, education for the population of the state with the positive long term effects of clean renewable solar power.     Long  term goal for the company is a 5 farm build, (5-6MW each).  Strategically placed across the state to supplement their dependence on natural gas and coal fired power generation.   Eventually, bringing 25-30MW of clean renewable power to the state over the course of a 5-10 year build.

The name Crabtree & Evelyn was inspired by John Evelyn, a 17th century botanist, and the English Crabapple tree, known for its beauty and use in home apothecary. Initially a small, family run business, the first store specialised in fine soaps sourced from around the world. One man's passion for travel coupled with an inherent desire for natural products, set the foundation for creating an international brand renowned the world over for its fragrances, body care products, fine foods and beautifully packaged gifts. Cyrus collected soaps and lotions made by small manufacturers around the world. What started as a vocation soon became a strong business proposition with customers delighting in the interesting and unique products available. From this one small shop selling an eclectic collection of fine soaps, Crabtree & Evelyn now has a strong retail presence in more than 65 countries including over 200 wholly owned branded retail stores. Creating the Crabtree & Evelyn brand was borne out of Cyrus' passion but he drew his inspiration from the life of John Evelyn, who was one of the first naturalists and conservationists and a visionary of his time. It was Evelyn's personal motto 'explore everything, keep the best' that resonated with Cyrus and remains at the heart of the brand today. Meal Soaps were the first products to be launched under the Crabtree & Evelyn brand and these have evolved over the years into a range of Heritage soaps which are still available today. These conditioning and rich-lathering soaps feature unique fragrance combinations from Crabapple & Mulberry to Black Sea Mud & Seaweed. From here the product portfolio expanded to include English Flower Waters and Toilet Waters, Bath Gels and Men's Colognes. The use of natural ingredients continued with the introduction of preserves, biscuits, teas and confectionery and Crabtree & Evelyn became known for its gourmet products in beautiful, botanically inspired packaging. Long before the 'natural' and 'wellness' movements became popular, Crabtree & Evelyn was producing ranges featuring fruit, flower and plant essences. The company continues to draw on its rich heritage and knowledge of plants and botanicals whilst embracing new discoveries. Today the Crabtree & Evelyn product range comprises fragrances, bath and shower gels, soaps, home spa products, body lotions, hand creams and home fragrance. The ethos of the company remains, seeking out the most beneficial ingredients inspired by nature to create a range of products which make a world of difference.

We prefer investment opportunities that already have the CEO on board who is capable of guiding the company through liquidity. On average, we invest $5-7 million per company, and we typically invest half of that amount in the first round of funding with similar amounts reserved for future private financing rounds. When we invest at an early stage of a company's development, we pursue a more conservative reserve policy, investing less per first round than many other comparable-sized funds. We believe that this strategy mitigates the increased risk inherent at that stage of investment and positions Salix Ventures to be a dependable participant in later rounds. We always invest with at least one other, high-quality, institutional venture investor in every investment.
