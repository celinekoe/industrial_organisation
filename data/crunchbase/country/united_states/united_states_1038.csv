Hemodialysis patients are at an increased risk for Hepatitis B seroconversion due to the opportunity for exposure during treatment and weakened immune systems. Seroconversion and prevalence rates have greatly declined since the 1970s when the first practice patterns and protocols to reduce the spread of HBV were mandated by the CDC. However, HBV is still of concern and outbreaks continue to occur. According to the CDC, “Investigations of these outbreaks have documented that HBV transmission resulted from failure to use recommended infection control practices, including: a) failure to routinely screen patients for HBsAg or routinely review results of testing to identify infected patients b) assignment of staff members to the simultaneous care of infected and susceptible patients c) sharing of supplies, particularly multiple dose medication vials, among patients Prevalence and seroconversion rates often differ facility-to-facility even with prevention protocols in place. HepBee addresses aspects of the practice failures that the CDC identified and ensures the successful practice patterns are being followed consistently and accurately by every staff member at every facility for every patient contact. HepBee interprets the complex Hepatitis B serological tests and guides the user to use correct protocols to reduce the incidence of HBV in hemodialysis patients.
