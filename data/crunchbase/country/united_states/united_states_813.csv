Aside from being a skilled tradesman, you also have to be concerned about lots of things, such as finding and targeting potential new customers, maintaining your business flow while keeping in view all the possible market standards. Local businesses typically find their first success by building a strong local network. However, what happens when the business is ready to expand to nationwide customers? Well, for glaziers, this can be a particularly difficult expansion. So much of business is determined by word of mouth, but for glaziers to be able to begin building a nationwide customer base, how do they overcome this grass-roots dynamic? The simple answer is by turning to a global, online marketplace to solve their problem. However, not just any online marketplace. The best online marketplace for local glaziers to turn for targeting nationwide customers is Glass Genius, for several reasons. Let’s walk through what Glass Genius is, how it works, and how it can help glaziers expand their existing local customer base to a nationwide customer base. Glass Genius is the first global online marketplace that connects local glaziers, installers, and fabricators with consumers, contractors, and interior designers in need of their services. Never before has there been a platform created solely for the glass and mirror industry. If you sell glass or mirror products and you are ready to expand beyond your existing clients to a nationwide customer base, then Glass Genius is the place for you! How it works could not be easier. First, you fill out a simple registration to create your account. Once registered, you can begin adding your products or services to your profile and connect with others within the industry or those looking to buy your services.

A close look at Hotel.com and they realized an amazing way to find hotels and compare prices anywhere with the click of a button.
