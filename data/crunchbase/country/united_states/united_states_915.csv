Professional networking can be as easy as swiping right. Valor Connect is a new mobile app applying the same principles of the most successful dating apps -- the swipe feature from Tinder, the compatibility algorithms from eHarmony -- to make finding and connecting with professionals you don’t yet know, but probably should, easier and more efficient than ever before.  Valor Connect is the ideal networking solution for whatever your goals are: - Consultants looking for business - Recruiters looking for candidates - Job seekers looking for opportunities - Students looking for mentors - Entrepreneurs looking for partners - Professionals looking to find industry experts - Individuals trying to expand their horizons Who you know often matters more than what you know -- it’s true. That’s precisely why networking is so crucial in building a career. But there’s an inherent problem with this system: the traditional networking process is awkward, time-consuming, and inefficient. People often fall short of their full potential because they can’t find the RIGHT people to connect with to locate the RIGHT opportunities for them. Networking at events is particularly challenging, and meeting interesting people is often a crapshoot. In addition to general networking, the other primary market for Valor Connect is conferences and events. Valor Connect provides an enhanced way for attendees to make valuable connections before, during and after events - all while also helping event organizers obtain potent metrics to really understand and know their attendees goals and interests.  Whether you are trying to identify the right people at an event, find an alumni mentor, or network with people in your organization, Valor Connect has made the process of finding inspiring people incredibly simple: 1. Log in with your LinkedIn or Facebook account.  2. Tap your professional and personal interests from a wall of tags.  3. Sit back and let our algorithm do all the work for you 4. Review your new curated stack of profile cards each day -- swipe right if you agree that they’d be a good person to meet, left if not.  5. Once both parties swipe yes, start messaging your new connection in-app.  At first glance, it may seem like Valor Connect is going head-to-head against LinkedIn, but the two actually form a symbiotic relationship. Valor Connect is not a competitor to LinkedIn; Valor Connect is a precursor to LinkedIn. LinkedIn is useful for storing your existing professional connections. The process is typically: meet someone in person at an event, through a connection, etc., and then connect on LinkedIn. The process on Valor is the opposite: meet on Valor, then connect in person at an event, conference, over the phone, email etc., and ultimately connect on LinkedIn. Meet on Valor, then connect on LinkedIn.","Apps, Community and Lifestyle, Professional Services, Software",2,"Andy Fine, Drew Riley",1-10,4,Seed,700000,USD,700000,1200000,USD,1200000,Ben Franklin Technology Partners,,1,,Private,,,,,,

Headquartered in Chicago, USG worldwide operations serve the commercial, residential, and repair and remodel construction markets, enabling their customers to build the outstanding spaces where people live, work and play. USG is an industry leader with 2015 sales of $3.8 billion, over 75 production facilities and a diverse footprint with sales and operations in over 20 countries. USG wall, ceiling, exterior sheathing, flooring underlayment and roofing systems provide leading-edge building solutions, while L&W Supply branch locations efficiently stock and deliver building materials throughout the United States. USG Boral Building Products is a leading plasterboard & ceilings joint venture across Asia, Australasia, and the Middle East. For more than 100 years, USG has built an ever-growing portfolio of groundbreaking products backed by unparalleled service. In the last decade, they have demonstrated their resilience by continuing to invest in purposeful innovation, expanding into different markets and by working smarter and faster. All to help their customers achieve their visions. Their commitment to innovation and focus on you, their customer is driven by a desire to help architects, contractors and workers alike to not only build better structures, but to build a better world. USG is North America's leading producer and distributor of gypsum wallboard, joint compound and a vast array of related products for the construction and remodeling industries. They are also the global leader in the manufacture of ceiling suspension systems and are recognized as the premier acoustical panel and specialty ceiling systems innovator. Their family of products provides creative building solutions that set new standards for productivity and efficiency, helping contractors and architects deliver high quality and innovative designs. USG, through its subsidiary L&W Supply Corporation, is also the nation's largest distributor of drywall and related building products. L&W serves the professional contractor through a network of more than 140 locations and strives to be their preferred source for all quality products and services they need to complete their projects — on time and on budget. USG has a rich history of innovation, with more than 1,100 patents granted for their industry-leading products. Most recently, their customers asked for lighter weight products and they responded by developing their award-winning ultra lightweight portfolio. Their culture of innovation — along with their commitment to all of their core values — drives us to constantly strive for new and better ways of serving their customers. USG has been committed to the safety of their employees, customers and the general public since 1902. They have developed and adhered to safety guidelines that exceed industry standards and regulations. In fact, 12 of their 34 U.S. manufacturing locations and three of their L&W Supply distribution facilities have applied and qualified for OSHA VPP Star status. To attain the Star designation, employees, management and OSHA work together to implement safety and health programs and processes that go beyond OSHA regulations to further protect employees and promote safe operations. Fewer than 2,500 worksites of the more than eight million in the U.S. have received the VPP Star designation. This ""safety first"" culture is what keeps their facilities more productive and it's why their employees are able to go home after every shift to see their families — many of whom work at USG for multiple generations. From the product formulations they choose, to the processes they employ, USG is committed to products that are designed, manufactured, distributed and used in a sustainable way and minimize overall environmental impact. And they have consistently led the industry in offering customers innovative products and services used in the construction of high-performing sustainable spaces. Their steadfast loyalty to the company's core business beliefs — safety, innovation, integrity, service, efficiency, diversity and quality — have helped us become the highly-regarded company they are today. USG's nearly 9,000 employees working in more than 30 countries are dedicated to helping their customers and partners achieve success.
