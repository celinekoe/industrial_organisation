Surface MIC acts as a ligand for the NKG2D immunoreceptor, which activates natural killer cells and co-stimulates CD8+ cytolytic T cells, leading to detection and elimination of tumor cells as part of normal immune surveillance activities. As the cancer progresses, cancer cells cleave surface MIC and releases a soluble form of MIC (sMIC) into the circulation. sMIC is highly immunosuppressive and disables the immune system by impairing NK and T cell activity, expanding the population of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tumor-associated macrophages in tumor microenvironment. Altogether, these damaging effects of sMIC allows cancer cells to grow and thrive. CuraB-10 clears the immune destruction of sMIC and re-invigorates the immune system to fight cancer.","Biotechnology, Science and Engineering",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Chava Energy,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/chava-energy,"Energy, Manufacturing, Mining, Renewable Energy, Solar","Miami, Florida, United States",Chava Energy™ (Chava LLC) develops breakthrough energy solutions,"931,429","Greater Miami Area, East Coast, Southern US",$1M to $10M,Active,2008-02-13,day,,,,,For Profit,http://www.chavaenergy.com/,"Chava Energy™ (Chava LLC) develops breakthrough energy solutions with the goal to dramatically reduce the need for fossil fuels and the associated economic, environmental, health, and geopolitical issues. Our new energy solutions will be substantially less expensive than any other existing form of power generation by tapping energy from the 96% percent of our universe that is currently invisible (dark energy and matter). These sources include Zero-Point Energy (also called Quantum Energy, or Vacuum Energy). Once technologies under development are ready for commercialization, Chava will enter the market with a strategically balanced mix between in-house production, partner-production in various applications including consumer products, and third-party licensing. There are countless claims and patents regarding new energy inventions to be found all around the world. However, none of these isolated claims have ever made it into commercially available products for a variety of reasons such as:     lack of adequate funding,     limited skills and abilities of individual inventors,     clashes between investors and inventors,     measurement errors,     fraud,     ridiculing by conservative ‘text-book’ scientists,     claims of suppression (through buy-outs and allegedly even threats or designation by the Government as Classified subject matter). Chava’s mission is to pursue an “Apollo Space Project” for clean, safe, abundant, and inexpensive energy, making it commercially available for everyone and breaking the existing monopolistic dependencies to benefit ALL consumers. Our goal is to fundamentally change the way we power our homes, businesses, transportation vehicles, and water purification systems in every part of the world, rich or poor. Current state: We are currently covering the full R&D life-cycle—from basic scientific research through applied development with proof of concept and prototypes and a production life-cycle from first tests to low rate initial production and then full-scale production. The Chava team includes some of the world’s leading scientists in diverse fields of research, electrical/electronic engineers, magnetic and materials scientists—as well as experienced entrepreneurs in startup development, corporate development, bridging R&D to full commercialization, sales and marketing, and Intellectual Property law for protection and enhancement, digital services development, through all forms of engineering. Chava Facilities currently include five Research Labs located around the world, in the US, UK, Germany, Italy, and Australia. There are excellent prospects for clean thermionic energy recovery process fueled by many sources of waste heat. For example, today’s cars waste 70–75% of the energy extracted from gasoline; power plants waste 40 – 75%; typically in the form of heat. Servers and data centers alone used more than 100 billion kWh in 2011, representing a USD 7.4 billion annual “electricity cost” and requiring the addition of 10 power plants to the nation’s power grid. Many large companies with massive heat generating server facilities have voiced strong interest for such Chava products once ready for mass-production. Key Target Markets: Residential Power Generation: We plan to enter the residential power market in a two-prong strategy. First, we are supplying consumers with small fuel-free devices covering most of the electricity demand in a typical household, while initially remaining connected to the existing power grid in a manner similar to many solar installations. After the initial trials are successfully completed, later generations of devices will be able to provide a grid-independent power supply to homes and apartments. These devices could be either purchased by the consumer or leased for a low monthly subscription fee. Automotive: Cars, trucks, buses, rail locomotives, RVs, electric-assisted bicycles, elderly person motive power, golf carts, scooters, electric motorcycles. Utilities: Utilities are constantly on the lookout for technologies that would enable them to build and operate power plants without the need of fossil or uranium fuels, producing renewable electricity at a much lower price point than any other alternative. It also eliminates the vast land-use and transmission/permitting problems that most other renewable power generation projects are faced with. Computing: PC’s, laptop, server – retrofit and new-build markets. Consumer Electronics: Cell phones/PDA’s, still cameras and video recorders, torches/flashlight, music players, portable DVDs, TVs, gaming, and power supplies; toys, scooters, bikes, electric skateboards. Aerospace: Initially engines for small aircraft. Later, advanced technology may ultimately replace or supplement engines for large air and spacecraft. Marine: Initially, propulsion systems for smaller vessels and yachts; but ultimately complete systems for large transport and cruise ships. Civil/Government: Street lighting; remote power; access control, security, surveillance, military bases, government office buildings, medical facilities and equipment.","Energy, Manufacturing, Natural Resources, Sustainability",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
