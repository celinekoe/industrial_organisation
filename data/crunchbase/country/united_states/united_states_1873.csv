Founded by a serial entrepreneur whose businesses make $5 million a year annually and as someone who has both succeeded and failed at multiple businesses, our mission is to guide and mentor business owners so that they can create their dream business and life. Too many business gurus preach that success in business is tied to just one thing, some say it's sales, others online marketing, social media, some say its finance, others swear by good management principles, but in reality it's a combination of each of these items and putting them all together in a working puzzle we call the 7 Figures growth algorithm.   When business owners harness the power of the growth algorithm within 7 Figures U their chance of building a 7 figures business increase dramatically.
