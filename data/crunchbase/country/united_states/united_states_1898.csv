The case was about the idea that “corporations are people” and allows special interest groups and the wealthy to spend money on U.S. elections. The money can be limitless and cannot be traced; in essence, U.S. elections can be bought. End Citizens United was formed on March 1st, 2015 to combat against large political funding groups with ulterior motives from paying for elections to go their own way. End Citizens United is financed not by big money, but by grassroots donations. They are committed to not only attempting to end Citizen’s United, but to see pro-reform candidates elected, keep the issue of using money in politics in the forefront, and more. As of August 2015, when End Citizens officially launched, they raised $2 million in support of their cause from small donors. As Richard Carbo, Communications Director of the group stated, “The groups entire cycle is set to take in an additional $25 million to $30 million more.” End Citizens United has backed pro-reform Democrats so far, and critics may point this out. However, the groups says “Even though many Republicans and Independent voters agree that undisclosed political spending is out of control, Republican leadership in Congress is standing squarely in the way of overturning this disastrous Supreme Court decision. It has to stop. So we will do what we can to support candidates who are champions for meaningful campaign finance reform.” If a Republican or Independent candidate were pro-reform, End Citizens United would support them. End Citizens United's website shows not only what they do, but posts the latest news, have a page for candidates that want finance reform, and a donation page. It also explains what you can do to end Citizens United by forming your own group, posting on your own social media websites, and spreading the word about pro-reform candidates up for election.",Government and Military,,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Like Ticketmaster serves large events, concerts etc, MadeIt.com provides a self-service ticketing platform to make it easier to sellout your small to medium sized events. How do we do this? MadeIt allows event organizers to: 1. Publish a customized event web page online 2. Promote your event using our online promotion tools 3. Easily sell and collect ticket revenue online The service works well for events like: - Workshops - Seminars - Tradeshows - Sporting events - Fundraisers  MadeIt.com's previous service: MadeIt.com, a social event planning application, has plans to displace Evite as the internet's most popular invite service.  Madeit brings to the table more customizable invitations as well as a social layer which evite currently lacks.   MadeIt's invites can have embedded video clips, photos, custom backgrounds, discussion areas and a place for general information of course.  Invites can be made from scratch or built up from a variety of pre-made templates.    The social layer comes in After events have passed.  MadeIt changes all events from invitation pages to ""aftermath"" pages where party goers can write comments and post pictures, videos and other media from the event.  The page becomes a mini-social network focused on a single event.  Unlike most social networks, MadeIt focuses on helping you meet new friends and then stay in touch by immediately bringing everyone back together online.   The company competes directly with [Socializr](http://crunchbase.com/organization/socializr) (from the founder of [Friendster](http://crunchbase.com/organization/friendster)), Evite, Mypunchbowl, SuggestLocal, Skobee and Renkoo.","Events, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Software",2,"Christoph Schmollmueller, Jonny Hendriksen",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Creators on Poemusart upload their poems, music, and art, then use our editor to digitally combine all three to create a new medium we call ""Poemusart"".   This new combination a moving image, spoken poem and background music is a lot more entertaining. Creators on Poemusart can speak or write their poems in their own unique style on various topics, from current affairs to comedy, from short stories to inspirational messages. All are translatable into 21 spoken languages at the click of a button.   Most people would not usually read a poem or scroll through art, but when poems, music, and art are combined, this new combination becomes a lot more entertaining. Creators on poemusart.com can speak or write their poems in their own unique style on various topics, from current affairs to comedy, from short stories to inspirational messages. All are translatable into 21 spoken languages at the click of a button. Users of poemusart.com are categorized as viewers, creators, and advertisers.   Viewers can stream the algorithm-curated Poemusarts as entertainment and discuss it in the comments section. And advertisers display their brands on the website. Advertisers and users are also able to commission creators to create content for them in exchange for tokens. Viewers can also purchase a subscription. Subscription benefits include: creation of a playlist; skipping advertisements; use of the Text to Poem AI; and use of the Text to Art AI. On poemusart.com, ""NFT"" (non-fungible token) means that we endeavor to make sure that each poem, music, and art uploaded is not a duplicate of one that already exists on the site. It is not blockchain. It is very easy to use for everyone.   We also make sure that each combination of poem, music, and art that constitutes a Poemusart is a one-of-a-kind combination. The primary purpose of the site is entertainment, similar to video streaming sites like TikTok.com. A Poemusart is like a video in that, when played, the viewer sees moving digital art and hears a spoken poem with music playing in the background. Creators and composers that contribute to the site are able to monetize their Poemusarts by receiving gifts in the form of tokens or through ownership transfers in exchange for tokens. The tokens on poemusart.com are similar to the tokens on Tiktok.com or the coins on Reddit.com; they are not crypto currency and only serve to lubricate gifts and exchanges on the site. The ownership transfer of a Poemusart is not the same as transactions on NFT platforms. Poemusarts cannot be downloaded from the site. There is no risk of your collection being stolen from the site.   Also, on other social media sites like TikTok.com, there are many duplicates of the same videos or concepts. Users copy each other's content because they seek the benefits of having that particular video on their page. On poemusart.com, since we take strides to ensure that each Poemusart cannot be duplicated, the only way users can acquire other coveted Poemusarts is by transferring ownership in exchange for tokens. Benefits of ownership include increased traffic to the owner's collection, more attention, more discussions, more donations, and possible ad revenue sharing.   Like the text-to-poem and text-to-art A.I. functions, the text-to-music A.I. function will allow users to simply type in certain keywords such as genre, styles, tempos, and moods into the text box, and the A.I. will generate a piece of music from that prompt.","Advertising, Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio, Other, Sales and Marketing, Social Impact, Video",1,Raymond Attah,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
