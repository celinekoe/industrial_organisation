Most importantly, users can then export their videos directly to YouTube or Facebook with a single click.  Our goal is to make video editing so easy that your grandmother can do it!   Loopster is currently seeking to raise $1M in seed capital.  Once funding is secured, Loopster will relocate to the Denver / Boulder area or Las Vegas.

Our novel approach uses a simple mechanism of action to selectively kill cancer cells and cancer stem cells while sparing normal cells. This provides a highly effective treatment with little to no side effects. Our lead drug candidate, OM-301, has two parts; the first attaches to a molecule that is present on the cell surface of more than 80% of cancer types we have assessed, but not on normal cells. When our drug attaches to this target, it uses it as an anchor; the second part then pokes holes in the cell membrane, causing extracellular liquid to rapidly enter, which in turn causes the cancer cell to burst. No known cancer drug uses such a mechanism, although many antibiotics kill bacteria in a similar way.  Our initial therapeutic target is acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Most AML patients relapse within 1 year of standard therapy, because it does not destroy cancer stem cells. As a result, AML has only a 25% 5-year survival rate. In contrast, OM-301 does destroy cancer stem cells, which has the potential to disrupt current medical treatment and fully cure AML. Recently, we showed that mice injected with AML cells taken directly from patients lived twice as long after receiving our drug. Following our proof of concept in AML, we expect to pursue development for patients with Multiple Myeloma and other blood and solid cancers.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",3,"John Abeles, Matthew Pincus, Steven Evans",1-10,6,Early Stage Venture,2045000,USD,2045000,2045000,USD,2045000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Founded in 2006 in St. Louis, the company’s revolutionary antenna technology allows for previously unforeseen advances in RFID technology by eliminating barriers to end user adoption while reducing infrastructure costs. RF Controls’ smart antenna hardware and software enables application of passive ultra-high frequency (UHF) RFID in real time location systems (RTLS). RF Controls’ bi-directional electronic steerable phased array antennas, which are core components of its Intelligent Tracking and Control System (ITCS®), use patented antenna technology to send a signal to a passive RFID tag, excite the tag (wake it up), and capture and read data from the tag. RF Controls real-time location systems are the only products in the world capable of tracking UHF passive RFID tags in real time, with accuracy of 12 inches. RF Controls has been awarded a foundational patent for its Intelligent Tracking and Control System. ITCS is best classified as a wide area RTLS  because ITCS provides much more than just tag identification data. By installing ITCS “smart antennas,” end users can illuminate an area (or volume) in which tagged items move or are stored, and achieve real-time, perpetual monitoring of an entire warehouse or retail floor. ITCS solves the fundamental business process problem of automatically and accurately locating arbitrarily placed tagged items without the spurious read problems inherent to other RFID systems.   RF Controls recently announced a joint venture with Stanley Black & Decker, View Technologies LLC.  Stanley Black & Decker is providing manufacturing, sales, marketing, installation, software and administrative services to the joint venture while RF Controls, in addition to ongoing scientific development, is providing an exclusive global license to its suite of groundbreaking bi-directional, steerable phased array fixed antenna systems.","Hardware, Internet Services, Professional Services, Software",4,"Graham Bloy, Thomas O.

With our technology, high-quality, controllable, and editable music is just a touch away. We're changing the way music is perceived and enjoyed, it's only a matter of time. We see a world where music creators are empowered to create and own their own music, and make a living doing what they love. We believe that everyone should have the freedom to express themselves through their art and be rewarded for their hard work and talent.  We're committed to building the tools and technology that make this vision a reality to support artists in their journey to success.  We're on a mission to unlock the true value of music and bring it to life for 1 billion people.
