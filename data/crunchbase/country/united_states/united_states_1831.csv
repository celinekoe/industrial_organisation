There is no constitutional requirement that district courts exist at all. Indeed, after the ratification of the Constitution some opponents of a strong federal judiciary urged that the federal court system should be limited to the Supreme Court, which would hear appeals from state courts.

Long duration dialogues are conversations and audio content ranging from 5 seconds to several hours. Yap specializes in accurately transcribing these dialogues for a variety of different scenarios including voicemail-to-text, conference call transcriptions, analysis of customer phone calls and voice-activated mobile messaging. The company was a TechCrunch finalist in 2007. Their management team previously worked on Apple's iPod, Honda's navigational systems, IBM's ViaVoice, Microsoft's Tellme speech division and Nuance's Dragon products. Yap white labels its SaaS platform -- i.e., Yap Speech Cloud(TM) -- to enable diverse use cases, including messaging, call analytics and voicemail-to-text. For example, Microsoft uses Yap for voice-based mobile messaging applications. Their end users can say anything they want to and have Yap's platform transcribe it into text (far more convenient than typing on the fumbling with a devices keypad while driving). MetroPCS also is a Yap customer. Cincinnati Bell, a regional carrier, uses Yap-based technology to convert subscriber voicemails into text. The carrier was a competitive win away from SpinVox (now Nuance). Part of the allure for Yap's service is that it's completely automated. That means there is no need for humans listening to messages, typing them out, and then sending them back out, giving Yap a real advantage in ensuring privacy. Because Yap is completely machine powered, the company is able to offer lower costs, higher speeds and greater consistency.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Hardware, Information Technology, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Messaging and Telecommunications, Mobile, Music and Audio, Science and Engineering, Software",2,"Igor Jablokov, Victor Jablokov",11-50,3,M&A,8000000,USD,8000000,10000000,USD,10000000,"Western Technology Investment, Harbert Management Corporation, Sunbridge Partners, Pittco Capital Partners, Timothy Biltz",3,6,,Private,,,,,,

The company combines expert media buying and unique technology to provide its clients with quality customer acquisition, lead generation, and user engagement. Union Square Media’s clients include Fortune 500 companies and top brands such as Wall Street Journal, Nestlé, and Match.com. Founded by Joshua Keller and Nick Matzorkis in 2010, the company has grown into a multimillion-dollar business with four offices across the United States.  Union Square Media is dedicated to supporting its employees and their families. Recognizing the challenges of women with families who are re-entering the workforce or who relocate frequently because of a spouse serving in the armed forces, the company established a “USM Mobile Workforce” initiative that allows them to maintain a work-life balance.
