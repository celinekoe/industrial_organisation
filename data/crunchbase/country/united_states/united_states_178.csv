Investors can get to know well-established real estate professionals and review their projects and profiles to make informed investment decisions based on market intelligence. They're also able to see the projects that aren’t doing as well; this transparency is something that has been widely available in everything from restaurants to stocks, but because of government regulations has been completely lacking in real estate investing. With the new JOBS act that all changes. Additionally, over time, being able to make smaller investments across a larger pool of properties allows investors to achieve greater diversification with their capital.  For real estate entrepreneurs, ForeFund exposes projects to a pool of potential investors quickly and easily. For larger projects, Entrepreneurs can leverage a team of professional marketers, putting years of experience with search, social, local and mobile media marketing to work to generate guaranteed investor leads and engagement in investments.

Adult services were located in a church on McKinney Avenue and children’s services were housed in the basement of Highland Park United Methodist Church on Mockingbird Lane. In 1959 UCP joined United Way.  The 1960’s saw an era of growth in mission and capabilities when both children and adults programs came together in a facility located on Core Street. Shortly after this relocation, UCPA’s leadership realized that the number of people it was serving had outgrown the new location and funds were raised to build a new facility located at Anson and Parwelk that would accommodate administrative offices and all UCP programs. In 1975 additional space for programming was acquired and the adult program was moved to a nearby location to better care for the individuals UCP was serving.","Community and Lifestyle, Health Care, Other, Sales and Marketing, Social Impact",,,101-250,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
