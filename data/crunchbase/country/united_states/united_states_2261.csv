Founded in 2000, NewQuest has grown from a single location in Tennessee to five facilities in Tennessee, Alabama, Illinois and Texas, serving over 100,000 beneficiaries in 60 counties and employing nearly 700. NewQuest operates four leading Medicare Advantage health plan providers: Tennessee HealthSpring, Alabama HealthSpring, HealthSpring of Illinois and Texas HealthSpring. In 2004, NewQuest was named one of Tennessee's Top 100 Companies by Business Tennessee. Also, in 2003, Nashville Business Journal awarded NewQuest one of its ""Best In Business"" Awards.

The company concentrates on a small number of high quality titles each year. NovaLogic is a privately owned company. The primary outside shareholder is Electronic Arts. A European office was set up in 1994 in central London to manage distribution, sales and marketing throughout Europe. Headed by the General Manager, Paul Rebhan, the office comprises 12 staff, bringing the total number of NovaLogic employees to about 100 world wide. The name NovaLogic, meaning ""New Logic"", represents a vision of designing and developing games from a new perspective. It is this new perspective that continually drives the company to produce innovative, leading-edge technology in order to achieve realistic environments, stunning graphics and addictive gameplay. The technology behind the success of franchises like Delta Force® and Comanche® has put NovaLogic firmly on the map when it comes to innovation in the games arena. NovaLogic spent its early years producing home versions of many popular arcade games and has produced original designs for more than a decade. These releases have established the company's reputation as a leading game developer. Success in the consumer military simulation market brought NovaLogic to the attention of the US Army. In 1999 NovaLogic Systems Inc. (NLS) was established to capitalize on the technologies NovaLogic had developed for the gaming market by bringing them to the military and civilian training communities.  NLS has worked with several US Army commands, notably as provider of training software for the Land Warrior soldier system. NovaLogic also has continued strategic partnerships with defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Sikorsky. With the introduction of its hugely popular NovaWorld™ game service in 1997, NovaLogic has taken the online gaming world by storm, enabling millions of game joins since NovaWorld's inception.  NovaWorld gives NovaLogic customers the chance to embark on knuckle biting multiplayer combat on dedicated NovaLogic servers. The unprecedented popularity of NovaWorld has contributed to the success of games like the Delta Force® franchise. Throughout NovaLogic’s history the company has developed original gaming content for both console and PC platforms and although NovaLogic is best known for developing military combat simulations, the company has, over the years, expanded its portfolio of titles.

Our proprietary Web-based software application, IQReview, provides savings and efficiency by re-pricing medical bills to the appropriate state fee schedule, usual and customary, or facility fee schedule. IQReview uses an Artificial Intelligence based computational procedure for duplicate bill checking. This process provides the most accurate and sophisticated method ever developed for eliminating duplicated charges of any kind. Many companies, large and small, entrust ACS CompIQ with their medical bill review work. ACS CompIQ's patented auditing process insures accuracy, screens for unnecessary services and applies the deepest network savings available. With the amazing IQReview, our team of expert bill agents double checks every bill for accuracy. ACS CompIQ will answer all provider questions and handle every re-evaluation. Our turnaround time and savings are setting the performance standard in the industry. ACS CompIQ Corp is very successful at developing customized EDI interfaces. The reality is that EVERY EDI interface is customized to a certain degree. Because we have world class software developers on staff, we are comfortable with even the most advanced levels of customization.Â  Our expertise extends to a wide variety of EDI interface technologies including the latest trends in XML web services for real time data transfer. The integration most often used for our clients begins with EDI transfer of claim and provider records from the claims management system to our bill review system. IQReview captures this data and makes it available to the bill review analyst's production use. Importantly, IQReview tracks any unique identifiers used by the claims system and returns them as part of the next step, which is the EDI transfer of payments records back to the claims management system.  This allows the claims management system to identify internal claim and vendor records associated with each payment with 100% accuracy and no manual intervention.  Many organizations have a need to interface with multiple claims databases and even different claims systems simultaneously. IQReview supports this requirement and automatically segments claim and vendor records so that the user is only presented with records from the appropriate claims system during production. IQReview interfaces with all major claims management systems such as:  David, David Renaissance, Risk Master, VOS, VOS Portal, Talisman, Sucaba, Pyramid, Stars, RiskCo, and Gensource.  As we add new clients we continually build new interfaces to client specifications.  The interface is provided via EDI (electronic data interface) to receive claims data and vendor data from an external system as well as transmit payment information to an external system. Payment information may include bill review fees, PPO fees and more broken down in whatever manner is appropriate to our customers' AP system. Additionally, IQReview provides data to claims systems in an EDI format to allow the printing of EOR information on check stubs.  EDI files can be transmitted via email, FTP, or floppy disk.  Information is also compliant with OLE, DB/ADO/ODBC - making it possible to work with any database engine. ACS CompIQ can accept import data in almost any format.  Likewise, we can accommodate almost any format needed for export.  Files are usually fixed-length ASCII data.",Software,,,1-10,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
