BSI's experienced staff features knowledge in the Unix, Linux, Windows, NetWare and Theos operating systems with application development capabilities in several programming languages.BSI was founded in September, 1976, and incorporated in March, 1977. Their original field of emphasis was in environmental database statistical processing (thus the name ‘biometrics’, which is the quantitative analysis of biological data). They developed several useful programs in their early years on a Cyber (Control Data Corp.) computer. With the advent of the early 8-bit personal computers some of these programs were ported to 8-bit microcomputer operating systems. As their reputation grew for the environmental analysis programs which they had developed, they began branching out into custom software development for a few local businesses. These businesses, in turn, recommended us to others and their software business burgeoned.  Their OASIS/THEOS experience dates back to some of the earliest versions of the operating system, which ran on Digital Group and Radio Shack TRS-80 Model II microcomputers. As the computer industry matured, they evolved through the Altos and IBC multi-user environments, into today’s Intel Pentium based computers, adding experience in XENIX and UNIX as 16 – and 32 – bit Personal Computers came to market.
