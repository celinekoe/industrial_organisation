We invest in four primary states: Arizona, Georgia, South Carolina, and Maryland. Our primary focus has been on residential properties, both improved and unimproved. We have secured liens on city homes, farms, lakefront cottages,...etc.     The majority of liens in the industry are redeemed by the owner (up to 98%), who pays the county his back-taxes, as well as interest payments to us. Owners who do not redeem and pay what they owe are susceptible to foreclosure, giving us triple digit returns.    Our target return is 100% net which we will share 50/50 with our investors. We enhance our returns by shortening the payment cycle of the lien repayment, and getting these investment funds back to work quicker.     We have developed sophisticated, proprietary software tools that automate every facet of the preliminary research that we do on each lien. Once we have a filtered shortlist of eligible liens, we manually scrutinize them, making sure we are aware of the collateral's criteria. We will also physically visit every lien's property that we are bidding on.    Tax liens are a superior way to make exceptional returns with minimal risk. We treat investor's money like its our own, and will not take any chances with it. Your investment is collateralized twice, once with the actual investment, and second with our funds, invested side by side with yours.    In the last 12 months, our best deals were:  Bought unimproved lot tax lien for $27K, sold 14 months later for $90K  Bought improved vacation home for $80K, sold 2 months later for $110K  Bought improved residential home for $95K, listed 1 year later for $199K  Bought improved residential home for $50K, will list for sale for $150K.","Financial Services, Real Estate",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
