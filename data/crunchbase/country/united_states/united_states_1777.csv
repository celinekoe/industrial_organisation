We do the heavy lifting with machine learning and computer vision to ensure untrained individuals have captured the right content and that it is of a diagnosable quality prior to transmission. We have built our solution to ensure that we can capture non-adherent patients where they already are by deskilling the process and improving accessibility for the most rural, impoverished, and marginalized populations. We've made it profitable to prevent diseases for the most at-risk Americans Business Overview:  Insight Optics empowers primary care providers (PCPs) to record and refer preventative pre-screening videos to local specialists for assisted diagnostics. Our goal is to enable PCPs to efficiently detect early signs of preventable diseases before permanent damage is done. We accomplish this by providing PCPs a platform to connect and send patient data to local specialists. This allows both users to monetize otherwise unrealized referral incentives and provide better care. Problem: Over 154 million patients in the United States are recommended for an annual retinal exam, especially those with a history of diabetes or high blood pressure. Unfortunately, less than 50% of this population will receive their screening due to the difficulty of visiting a specialist, lack of education or available specialists. However, most of these patients do see PCPs annually.   Solution: We’ve developed a telemedicine PaaS, enabling PCPs to record and refer retinal exams to local specialists for assisted review. PCPs create a new revenue stream through reimbursements and government incentives. Specialists find qualified leads and increase their screening capacity without the need for in-person appointments in a non-adherent population. Benefits: The OptoView system acts as a new revenue stream for both PCPs and specialists through reimbursement. The tool satisfies HEDIS requirements for PCPs and acts as a lead generation tool for specialists to find new patients. Annual reports determine whether managed care organizations receive reimbursements or penalties from state and federal agencies. Our application is designed to satisfy the requirements for annual diabetic eye screenings, increasing an organization’s compliance rates and ophthalmologists prioritize sick patients.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Hardware, Health Care, Software",3,"Aaron Enten, Jermaine Fanfair, Theodore LaGrow",1-10,5,Seed,930000,USD,930000,930000,USD,930000,"Microsoft, Newchip Accelerator, Health Wildcatters, CREATE-X, Ideaship",4,17,,Private,,,,,,
