IUMA's goal was to help independent artists use the Internet to distribute their music to fans while circumventing the usual distribution model of using a record company. IUMA originally existed as FTP and Gopher sites before the World Wide Web was widely used. On March 9, 1994 CNN featured IUMA in their ""Showbiz News"" segment. Around 1998, IUMA was purchased by EMusic, and moved operations from Santa Cruz to Redwood City, home of the EMusic offices. IUMA provided artists who registered with a free URL and web page. The artists could present their music over the Internet in stream, download, and internet radio format. Further, it provided an easy-to-use home page for the band and the ability to distribute their music with no bandwidth fees. Some of the original file formats used to encode the music were WAV, AIFF and MP2. MP3 was added later as that format became more popular.","Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio",3,"Jeff Patterson, Jon Luini, Robert Lord",11-50,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
