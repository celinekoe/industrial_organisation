Over 90% of generated or collected data provides no business or analytical value, yet we pay to collect and store it. Meanwhile, data production is only increasing at an exponential rate. The root causes are lack of skilled resources, lack of automation in current tools and ever-growing volumes of data. Research shows that this problem is felt across nearly every industry, across both public and private sector entities, and at multiple levels of the organization. Yet nearly every leader places Analytics and becoming more data-informed as a priority.  The Inzata Solution Inzata is a next-generation, AI-augmented software platform that solves this challenge head-on.  Inzata provides a platform and tools to speed and streamline the process of turning raw data into valuable insights and knowledge, usable by anyone, no technical degree required.

The BlinkLab smartphone application enables remote neurobehavioral testing in children and adults to help diagnose and monitor neurological disorders such as schizophrenia, autism and attention deficit hyperactive disorder. The app can also be used in neuroscience and psychology research to study fundamental mechanisms underlying learning and memory formation. Until now, these tests have required dedicated hardware in a permanent lab environment with substantial face-to-face interaction between researcher and participant. The new app is user-friendly, especially for infants and autistic patients since no face attachments are needed. The BlinkLab smartphone app allows performance of neurobehavioral tests remotely using the user’s own cell phone. Anyone can do the tests by themselves at home following the user-friendly instructions provide by the app. Experiments can be programmed by the healthcare professionals or researchers and selected from a list on the smartphone by the user. Data acquired with BlinkLab can be securely shared with healthcare professionals or researchers During a typical evaluation, the user will watch an entertaining movie or play a simple video game on the smartphone, while the smartphone delivers short auditory and visual stimuli in specific patterns. A test takes about 10-20 minutes. Using state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms, BlinkLab will measure the motor and emotional responses of the user to these stimuli. For most experiments, the main focus will be on eye movements and eye blinks. BlinkLab provides a behavioral readout using machine-vision algorithms, which can be used to characterize specific movements at video frames.","Health Care, Software",6,"Anton Uvarov, Bas Koekkoek, Chris de Zeeuw, Henk-Jan Boele, Peter Boele, Samuel Wang",11-50,1,Seed,1200000,AUD,881437,1200000,AUD,881437,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Nearly all solid cancers grow faster than their blood supply, leading to regions of low oxygen in the tumors and HIF activation. The HIFs in turn induce the expression of over 100 genes that help tumor cells survive and spread. OncoSpherix has several classes of small molecules that block activation of HIF-1 through novel mechanisms. OncoSpherix’s lead clinical candiate has been shown in mouse models to reduce primary tumor growth, inhibit metastases, and prolong survival in many types of cancer (glioblastoma, pancreatic cancer, uveal melanoma, lung cancer, breast cancer).

Clinical results generated to date using BackBeat’s own Moderato™ pacemaker incorporating PHC algorithms demonstrate that this therapy has a substantial and sustained therapeutic effect on blood pressure as determined by both in-office cuff measurements (average reduction of 24 mmHg from baseline) and 24-hour ambulatory measurements (average reduction of 14 mmHg from Baseline) with clinical follow up extending past two years in certain patients.
