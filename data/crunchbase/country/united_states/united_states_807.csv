The company is leveraging its DIMERx™ technology to address the problem of visceral hypersensitivity and pancreatitis in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders and the unmet medical needs in the treatment of both peripheral neuropathic and systemic nociceptive pain. The lead candidate ORP-101 is a peripherally acting sodium ion channel blocker (Nav 1.7), mu agonist/kappa antagonist dimer. The molecule does not cross the blood brain barrier and, unlike other opioids that constrict the sphincter of Oddi, ORP-101, when given intravenously in animal studies, has instead been shown to relax the sphincter. The former attribute implies no abuse potential and the latter minimizes the risks of pancreatitis and/or abdominal pain related to sphincter of Oddi constriction. These two attributes, in combination with the well-understood pharmacology of ORP-101, make the molecule a suitable candidate for chronic treatment of conditions associated with visceral and somatic hypersensitivity and hyperalgesia. Therefore we have positioned ORP-101 for two non-overlapping indications: the oral form for colonic hyperalgesia and gastric dysmotility in IBS-D and the parenteral form for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain. The potential clinical benefits are backed by compelling data from validated animal models. The company is also developing potent non-opioid and opioid conjugates to treat acute and chronic nociceptive pain. The non-opioid analgesic conjugate is designed to be non-ulcerogenic and liver-safe and, therefore, has the potential to reshape the pain market served by acetaminophen and NSAIDs. Similarly, the opioid conjugate is designed to be orally active and have a lower potential for dependence than currently available opioids. DIMERx™ technology results in conjugates designed to preserve the receptor pharmacology of their individual constituents, but to have therapeutic profiles well suited for different clinical indications. The components of the conjugates have all been previously proven to be safe and effective for other indications and, therefore, the conjugates have reduced developmental risks. The DIMERx™ conjugates are considered to be new molecular entities and have composition of matter intellectual property protection.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",3,"Frank Steinberg, Nikhilesh Singh, Pankaj Pasricha",11-50,2,Early Stage Venture,39000000,USD,39000000,41816012,USD,41816012,"New Enterprise Associates, Takeda Ventures, Pappas Capital, Relativity Healthcare Partners, Mario Family Funds",2,5,,Private,,,,,,

All of this is done in the name of protecting data. But, once files are moved, shared, or stolen, the data is no longer protected. Even worse, these controls get in the way and frustrate business users to the point they intentionally work around them. Anchor inverts the equation by baking protection into the data, invisible to the business users (like antivirus), so that files are free to travel and security is out of the way. Simply put, wherever the data goes, it is protected. Anchor is a SaaS platform, with an endpoint component, that bakes protection into your files with a unique transparent combination of encryption, continuous multi-factor access controls, and a digital chain of custody. And when you do share or collaborate, Anchor protection stays with your data, even when it leaves your organization. Anchor empowers you to maintain control of your files while collaborating on premise or in the cloud, including forensic logging and revoking access. In under 90 minutes, Anchor is fully deployed and empowers your business users to securely work and collaborate without complicated security products or rules in the way. All without requiring you to change existing IT controls or how your users and applications work today. DAtAnchor is a result of a multi-year research activity, developed at Ohio State University.
