My family and I have been using The Natural Solution products for many years and believe it's the best natural spa and hot tub cleaner on the market. Rainbow Rocks are the hottest selling, most innovative fragrance product to hit the market in years. We started using The Natural Solution for Hot Tubs because my wife was having adverse skin reactions to the hot tub chlorine and bromine I was using. She would get out of the tub with red, irritated and itchy skin. We began the search for a natural hot tub chemical alternative . When we found The Natural Solution, I was skeptical at first but after getting in the spa the first time, I was excited! There was no chemical smell and it was like sitting in a nice warm bath. After my wife got out of the hot tub, her skin was soft and smooth, not dry and itchy. I was a believer! We've been using The Natural Solution ever since. It was so easy to use and the tub was so clean, clear, and soft, I decided to start selling it. Now that I am telling the world about natural hot tub products and The Natural Solution I hope that you will have the same great experience that we've had. Why not share your experiences with family and friends and refer them to our on-line store for our entire line of spa chemical alternatives. I know they will Love it!!!
