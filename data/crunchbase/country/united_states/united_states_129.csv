The idea was to create a platform where Online Competitions and Talent Hunts could take place and artists could be chosen through public voting. The idea didn’t receive much attention as it was ahead of its time, therefore, talentsofworld.in was discontinued in 2019. In the year 2018, talentonline.tv was introduced, the concept was to provide a video platform to broadcast video as well as the content of talented artists to share their talent and creativity out there. The idea and the platform were cherished by a lot of people and thus, the company decided to make the required changes for its User-friendliness.  Later in the year 2020 for ease of understanding, its name was changed to 9xm.tv.  Production Services : Talentsofworld also provides Production services for Photoshoots and Video-shoots at minimal costs to Indian Artists.

The very first location in Clearwater, FL was opened the day after Thanksgiving and is still in operation. Within 4-months it became necessary to open a 2nd location in Seminole, FL which is also still in operation. Dan's Fan City continues to grow today and currently operates 44 stores throughout a 7 state area as well as placement in select lighting showrooms throughout the country and via the internet that ships product worldwide. Initially, Dan's Fan City utilized existing ceiling fan suppliers such as Hunter, Casablanca, Emerson, Fasco, Encon, Gulfcoast Fans, Union Fan Company and Fanimation. Dan established a strong bond with Gulf Coast Fans which was established in 1973 and was located in Safety Harbor, Florida right nearby the first location. Gulfcoast Fans was one of the first companies to supply ceiling fans to retailers in the United States with parts supplied from Taiwan and assembled & packaged in the US. In 1983, Dan's Fan City purchased Gulf Coast Fans so that he could begin to give the customers a new experience in purchasing a ceiling fan allowing him to differentiate themselves from the new mass market retailers such as Home Depot & Lowes and to control quality. The idea of the ceiling fan in the box gave way to a new customer experience in which the customer now can choose the style/finish of fan then choose from a variety of blade options and they can add lights & accessories if they choose.",Manufacturing,,,101-250,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
