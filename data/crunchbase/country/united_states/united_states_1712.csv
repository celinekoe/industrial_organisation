King Cayuga Vodka,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/king-cayuga-vodka,"Craft Beer, Food and Beverage, Organic","Ithaca, New York, United States",King Cayuga Vodka is made on a farm with organic local white wheat.,"3,093,020","East Coast, Northeastern US",,Active,2014-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,http://www.KingCayuga.com,"""""The King of Vodka"""" King Cayuga Vodka is made on a farm with organic local white wheat from the Fingers Lakes and spring water that has naturally flowed through limestone. Through the use of state-of-the-art technology in conjunction with old world techniques, King Cayuga is developing the best vodka in the world.     The Name and Logo King Cayuga Vodka gets it's name from being produced in King Ferry, NY right next to Cayuga Lake.  The royal logo of a duck fitted with a crown pays homage to the Cayuga Duck, found only in the Cayuga Lake area.   The Distillery The distillery has received Double Gold and an award for """"Best Vodka"""" from the New York International Spirits Competition. Likewise, it produced the alcohol used in the brand that won Double Gold and """"Best Vodka"""" in the San Francisco World Spirits Competition. By using only local organic ingredients, a controlled slow fermentation system, as well as a complex distillation and filtration process that takes place 10 times, King Cayuga is creating the purest and best tasting vodka in the world. Creating The Vodka Vodka this good has never been on the market before. King Cayuga Vodka is made with the utmost care and patience, making use of all new technology and machinery. While some vodkas only ferment for three days, King Cayuga rests for two whole weeks in a controlled high-tech tank. This results in a much purer alcohol before it is filtered.   Environmentally Friendly The wheat that goes into King Cayuga Vodka is 100% natural, organic, and local, conveniently situated on the same farm that homes the distillery. Any waste that is produced from the production of vodka is recycled into the farm for use. Also, the bottles are sourced from the fingers lakes area, less than an hour away. These three things cut down on their carbon footprint and help sustain American jobs.","Food and Beverage, Sustainability",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

With SkyJuke, users add their songs to a shared playlist that everyone can listen to. SkyJuke features two types of play methods to suit your needs: Group Play and Party Play. With Group Play, SkyJuke plays the “now playing” song out of all connected smartphones at the same time. Instead of sharing earbuds, SkyJuke lets you share and experience music with your friends with your own smartphone. This play method is ideal for a couple on a plane who want to listen to the same song together or for a group of friends on a crowded subway. And with Party Play, the “now playing” song from the shared playlist plays out of only one smartphone. Now, the host of a party can have his or her guests contribute to the music, or a coffee shop can give its customers the ability to control the music that is playing inside. Smartphones with Wi-Fi Direct can use SkyJuke without a wireless router. This comes in handy so you can have SkyJuke playing music while on a road trip or camping with friends. SkyJuke also allows users to create profiles, vote songs to the top or out of the playlist, text chat within the app, and ban undesirable users from the SkyJuke network.  Download SkyJuke so you can share, stream and discover music with your friends…or complete strangers…in real life.","Content and Publishing, Hardware, Information Technology, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Messaging and Telecommunications, Mobile, Music and Audio, Platforms, Software, Video",1,Cody Cox,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
