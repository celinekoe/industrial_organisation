Ternionâ€:tm:s â€œPhoto Bioreactorâ€ systems both enable CO2 emitters (e.g., power producers, refineries and manufacturing facilities) to lower their greenhouse gas emissions and thereby comply with emerging regulations and emissions-reduction incentives, and turn emissions into â€œfoodâ€ for a wide variety of algal strains which then can be converted into products such as biofuels, nutraceuticals, animal feed, bio-chemicals, industrial lubricants and solvents, fertilizers, plastics and more.  Ternion's Photo Bioreactors overcome the biggest challenges facing existing algae-based approaches to carbon sequestering:  scalability and control.  The Photo Bioreactor system is designed to scale vertically as well as horizontally, allowing much higher-density algae production on a compact footprint. And because the Photo Bioreactor is a closed-loop, self-contained system, it is not vulnerable to inclement weather or contamination (from pollution, rogue algae species or wind-borne contaminants). Ternion goes beyond simply sequestering, or storing, carbon dioxide and other harmful emissions. Ternion effectively recycles these emissions to grow useful algae. This approach is unique compared to mainstream approaches such as burying emissions underground or on ocean floors. Ternion can grow essentially any strain of algae in our Photo Bioreactors, providing tremendous flexibility in the â€œoutputâ€ markets we serve.","Energy, Health Care, Natural Resources, Sustainability",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

By implementing e-commerce best practices, we help this underserved market grow both their audience and revenue significantly. The problem we are solving-->> Online retailers excel at the bottom of the purchase funnel: search and decision, but fail in inspiration and browse. Consumers visit retail sites with a product in mind, and never browse the inventory retailers try to promote and expose.  Online influencers have really figured out inspiration. They have a dedicated audience that comes for inspiration and ends up purchasing based on what they read and see. But the whole shopping experience for these influencers is based on simple text links, lacking all the standard best practices we're used to in e-commerce experiences (similar items, hotness signals, recommendations, search or browse paths). Our solution-->> Witlee bridges that gap by providing the best e-commerce solution for influencers today. We provide influencers with a retail standard, e-commerce storefront that's fully based on their images, and implement all the current e-commerce best practices across desktop and mobile.  Our Witlee store is a fully automated solution that creates an intuitive shopping experience for their audience. Their great content, and our store, enhances conversion and engagement tremendously.","Advertising, Commerce and Shopping, Content and Publishing, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Sales and Marketing",2,"Doron Gavra, Drew Schulz",1-10,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,TEC Ventures,,1,,Private,,,,,,
