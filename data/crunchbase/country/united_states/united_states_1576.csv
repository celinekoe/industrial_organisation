To use the site, simply do the following:   1. Sign Up (No personal info required)   1. Create categories to track your expenses or income (i.e. Groceries, Utilities,         Gas, etc.)    2. Then just add transactions for those categories.  Transactions can also be entered  through our Google gadget or iPhone web app. Expenseview will then take this data and provide users with an overall view of their expenses, income and potential savings.   The site doesn't collect any personal data.  It only works with expense and income transactions entered by the user.  It does not collect any account information either.  This provides total security since the data is completely anonymous.   The other reason for this manual entry approach is that keeping track of expenses should take some effort.  Entering transactions and seeing an expense breakdown makes for better educated consumers. In the future, the site will be adding native IPhone, Android, Symbian and Blackberry apps.  This will make it easier for users to view and add transactions easier on the go. The other goal is to also share the collective data with our users in an easily searchable way.  We hope this will help users to make truly informed purchasing decisions.","Apps, Data and Analytics, Financial Services, Software",1,Rens Methratta,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

This service provides social access through warm introductions. Pearescope users do not need to subscribe to another social network, rather, this service enables existing networks to come offline and into the real-world with a self-regulated balance of privacy and connectivity.  How it works: Users set their ""spotlight"", the area in which they wish to be seen around their smartphone, and apply their social networks to that geographic area. Users may also define their ""surface time"", the duration in which they want to be actively networking with those nearby. ONLY when their spotlights and surface times of two users overlap, and both share a mutual connection, will Pearescope send an icebreaking text message to both members: ""John, Jane is in your spotlight who also knows your friend Jon Smith."" Why its different: Pearescope is check-in free and private.  This service provides social access through mutual connections. Pearescope allows users to cherry-pick the most important and meaningful relationships from their second network through a demographic filter. Such filters include gender, school, and relationship status. Its patent pending technology only alerts members if both are within each other's spotlights. For example, if Jane sets her spotlight to 5 miles and Jon sets his to 500 feet, both would only be introduced if Jane was inside Jon's spotlight.","Apps, Commerce and Shopping, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Sales and Marketing, Software",1,Whit Schrader,1-10,2,Early Stage Venture,325000,USD,325000,325000,USD,325000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

WiMAX is also an acronym meaning ""Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX). WiMAX is a wireless digital communications system, also known as IEEE 802.16, that is intended for wireless ""metropolitan area networks"". WiMAX can provide broadband wireless access (BWA) up to 30 miles (50 km) for fixed stations, and 3 - 10 miles (5 - 15 km) for mobile stations. In contrast, the WiFi/802.11 wireless local area network standard is limited in most cases to only 100 - 300 feet (30 - 100m). With WiMAX, WiFi-like data rates are easily supported, but the issue of interference is lessened. WiMAX operates on both licensed and non-licensed frequencies, providing a regulated environment and viable economic model for wireless carriers. At its heart, however, WiMAX is a standards initiative. Its purpose is to ensure that the broadband wireless radios manufactured for customer use interoperate from vendor to vendor. The primary advantages of the WiMAX standard are to enable the adoption of advanced radio features in a uniform fashion and reduce costs for all of the radios made by companies, who are part of the WiMAX Forum™ - a standards body formed to ensure interoperability via testing. The more recent Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard is a similar term describing a parallel technology to WiMAX that is being developed by vendors and carriers as a counterpoint to WiMAX.",Mobile,1,Michael Wolleben,11-50,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
