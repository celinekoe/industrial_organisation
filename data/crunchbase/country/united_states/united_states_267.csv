Inspired by the beauty of nature and the wildlife that inhabits it, each piece of jewelry they manufacture tells a story and reflects the rich culture it symbolizes. The talented artists they work with contribute their intricate artistic designs, representing the Northwest Coast Native American and First Nations, Celtic, and Tahitian cultures.  Their story began in 1895, when one man’s ambition to leave a lasting impression on the American jewelry industry became a reality. Soon after striking gold in the fields of the Great Klondike in Alaska, Joseph Mayer built Joseph Mayer & Bros. Inc. in Seattle, Washington. The company began by producing souvenir spoons, flatware, and wholesale jewelry then grew to become one of the largest jewelry manufacturing companies in the United States. Known today as Metal Arts Group, their passion for manufacturing quality jewelry follows that of Mayer all those years ago. Over time their jewelry line has expanded into much more, taking culturally inspired artwork from well-known artists across the United States and turning them into not just jewelry but heirloom works of art. Metal Arts Group was acquired by The TharpeRobbins Company (now called Enage2Excel) in 2014, moving the manufacturing facility to Attleboro, Massachusetts. Since 1892, TharpeRobbins has earned a unique place in history as a manufacturer of military badges, Olympic medals, NASA medallions and World Trade Center 9/11 Medals of Honor and Heroism. As a leader in the jewelry industry, the ISO 9001:2008 certified manufacturer offers a wide-range of capabilities, world-class design and craftsmanship to its customers.","Clothing and Apparel, Community and Lifestyle, Consumer Goods, Design, Manufacturing",,,101-250,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
