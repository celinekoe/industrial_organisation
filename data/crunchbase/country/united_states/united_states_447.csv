Wouldn’t you like extra money in your wallet each month? If you answered yes to both of these questions, then the experts at Atlantic Duct Cleaning have the solution for you - dryer vent cleaning. With a professional dryer vent cleaning, you will reduce the risk of fire from lint build-up in the vents and increase energy efficiency, resulting in lower electric bills. A clean and properly installed dryer vent is critical to ensuring that water is fully eliminated from the clothes and expelled outdoors during the drying cycle. If your dryer vent has a lot of build-up, moisture can condense into pools of water in the dryer vent, resulting in conditions where mold and mildew grow. A professional dryer vent cleaning makes the air in your home is healthy to breathe. Dryer fires can occur when lint builds up in the dryer or in the exhaust duct. Lint blocks the flow of air, causing excessive heat build-up, and can result in a fire. As a preventative measure, clean the dryer vent and exhaust duct on a regular basis. By eliminating the build-up in the vent, your dryer won’t have to work as hard. Increasing your dryer’s efficiency will use less energy while operating (saving you money!). Extend dryer life. Similarly, a dryer vent line that is clogged with lint will cause your dryer to work harder, resulting in a shorter life span. A properly maintained dryer vent helps to achieve maximum performance and can extend the life of your dryer. ","Energy, Sustainability",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

People don’t have an ability to create events that they can get their friends to participate in at venues or establishments from their smartphones. Problem: The mobile world today provides no simple unified way that allows people organize a group get together at a venue or event. Social applications should be easy to use, fun, and connect people from many social venues. GoDutch is a social networking Application that connects users across all social spectrums (think Facebook & Twitter) on iPhone and Android devices. The application geographically publishes and enables you to share any event or item at any venue and the cost, within or outside of your immediate community. GoDutch also aims to change the way that merchants use advertising to attract consumers. By bucking mainstream advertising mediums with bloated costs and unknown returns and leveraging the richly dominating mobile smartphone device market, GoDutch will provide merchants with DIY-like control through a slick socially connected Advertising application engine. This provides a simple but immediate choice outside of the typical street corner bed mattress clown and convoluted Ad channel ecosystem.   ""I'm in! What's the first thing that comes to mind when you think “Go Dutch”?  For the 6 co-founders at 4Creative Inc. it simply chained back to a term that a family member used when referring to their foray into dating = ‘ lets split the bill!’. The possibilities exploded.  From there it quickly developed into a mobile Application that offers users not only the ability to publish the cost of an event, but create an event that collectively reaches out to friends, establish a venue enriched with on device mapping, provide a timeframe, post a picture...  and GoDutch! All the essential social networking features that give users a compelling experience.  Most importantly, the Application provides the ability for users to broadcast an event to an to a broad and powerful social networking audience including Facebook, Twitter, email, SMS and push notifications on device with the ability for recipients to respond inside the Application alerting the creator ""Who's in"".
