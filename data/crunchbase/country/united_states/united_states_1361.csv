One was in it's third round of funding having just received $54 M. BigDay! Reminder is an app that ""Never let's you forget another important event in the lives of people you care about, and helps you to always buy the perfect gift."" It is available for free in the App Store for iPhone & iPad as ""BigDay!"" and also on the web at www.BigDayReminder.com. Besides sending users automatic reminders of friend's (or the users private) events, it also provides the opportunity to shop at over 500 stores online for gifts. Because users can pre-select their favorite stores and build ""wish lists"" of gifts that they would like to receive, the app makes shopping an enjoyable and stress free process.
