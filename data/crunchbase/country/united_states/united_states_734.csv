The early designs incorporating our core technology and patented scientific principles have consistently demonstrated precision in measurement far superior to current measurement devices and technologies.   Our core technology began as The Sentinel, a non-invasive consumer glucose measurement device. This technology led into the development and refinement of IP designed specifically for automated blood glucose measurement before, during and after surgical procedures and in critical care units.  Research consistently shows that properly managed blood sugar reduces healthcare costs and improves patient outcomes. Today, there are no patient monitoring solutions that provide this data with sufficient accuracy, immediacy, or frequency to achieve necessary blood sugar goals. Moreover, current methods are labor intensive, expensive, and lack the accuracy that our IP provides.  In fact, the accuracy of TecMed's patented and patent pending clinical measurement IP has been demonstrated in more than 30 human trials. In this unserved global market, currently valued at nearly $3B, we are the only organization that has met the current US government regulatory specifications for glucose measurement accuracy in critical care environments.  Over 370 shareholders have invested nearly $58M in the creation and refinement of our core technology for utilization in this $15B industry.  As we transition from research and development to marketing, we are actively seeking commercialization partners.   Our IP for non-invasive consumer, automated clinical patient, and other medical measurement and monitoring designs are ready to be transferred to others for utilization in adaptive medical device design development, manufacturing and monetization.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Manufacturing, Science and Engineering",,,11-50,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Each program follows a mastery-based approach rather than a memorization- or assessment-based pathway. At the core of the Delphian School’s academic approach is the educational philosophy of L. Ron Hubbard, embodied in his Study Technology structure. Study Technology enables self-directed learning: the ability to teach oneself whatever one wants to learn. Students move through the school’s forms (the equivalent of grade levels) and ultimately complete its graduation requirements through a combination of experimentation, hands-on project work, community service, and other nontraditional academic activities that help them apply whatever they’re learning in the classroom. Each program also covers basic topics across disciplines like history, art, foreign language, science, mathematics, and literature. As an independent nonprofit organization not affiliated with any government, religious, or interest groups, the Delphian School receives operational and capital funds from tuition, fees, and charitable contributions from alumni and supporters. Its parent organization, Delphi Schools, Inc., is licensed to use Applied Scholastics® educational services.

Pinnacle is a Limited Liability Corporation with two business units, IT consulting & engineering services, and vocational rehabilitation services for veterans. IT consulting & engineering services will pursue federal government contract set-s-sides for small businesses and SDVOSBs. Vocational rehabilitation services help Veterans transition back into civilian life and join the private-sector workforce.   Despite the political gridlock in Washington over government spending, funding for the VA has grown in 2015, by nearly 68% from 2009. The politicians understand our nation has a solemn obligation to take care of our Veterans and to honor them for their service and sacrifices on behalf of the United States. To deliver on this commitment, the Federal budget provides $65.3 billion in discretionary funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), a 3-percent increase above the 2014 enacted level.   Pinnacle is poised for success because it will take advantage of current atmosphere in Washington, policies, and initiatives to enter in to the federal contracting business to capitalize on the abundant opportunities set-a-side for SDVOSB. The atmosphere in DC, paves a short path to success for Pinnacle. This plan will show how Pinnacle will breakeven in the first year of business, and become a $25 million company by 2019.","Information Technology, Privacy and Security, Professional Services",1,Micheal Davis,1-10,1,,30000,USD,30000,30000,USD,30000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Dynamic Data Concepts began in 1992 when it developed a custom software package called School Director Pro for a large school. The school had searched the commercial market for an “off the shelf” solution, but found the available products to be rigid, cumbersome, and unsuitable for their specific needs. The school hired a software-consulting firm to help them in their quest. With their help, it was determined that an application that would meet their needs simply did not exist. Determined to create the system of their dreams, and armed with a comprehensive needs assessment, the school interviewed several prospective software developers. Upon being selected, the developer spent three years “experiencing” the school, interacting with all levels of the staff and analyzing their needs throughout the school-year cycle. It was within the school setting, hand-in-hand with the end users, that the application was designed, programmed, and tested. Once implemented, the school saw productivity increase and the margin of error diminish. By having one centralized and comprehensive system, all their data was now conveniently organized and readily accessible, facilitating the tasks of the various staff members throughout the school. The success of the system circulated throughout the education and non-profit world and calls began to come in from other organizations requesting similar assistance. In response, Dynamic Data Concepts, Inc. was formed in 1995. The system was packaged for the commercial market and the original School Director Pro application was released to the public. As soon as the application hit the market, numerous schools and fundraising organizations jumped on the bandwagon, eager to utilize SDP for their computing needs. As clientele grew, so did the system’s level of sophistication. Since our initial DOS-based system, Dynamic Data Concepts has released three Windows based systems.  Our current release, the 360° Solutions Suite incorporates over 20 years of client feedback with the latest in technology. Surpassing all others in terms of scope and penetration, the 360° Solutions Suite includes Windows, Web and Mobile solutions.",Software,1,Chaim Schwartz,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
