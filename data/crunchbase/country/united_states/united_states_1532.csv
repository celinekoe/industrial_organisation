Our finding of a significant decrease in the function of CO in platelet mitochondria isolated from subjects with MCI solidified the hypothesis that interference with mitochondrial function is an early and detectable systemic event in AD pathophysiology which can be leveraged as a biomarker of the disease. While the mitochondrial assays used in that earlier work have shown themselves to be relatively laborious and variable, each requiring mitochondrial isolation from the target cells as a first step, our early work with this technology has revealed a new methodology for the application of reliable tissue histochemistry to cells in suspension, thus enabling the accurate assessment of mitochondrial enzyme activity without confounding mitochondrial isolation, greatly improving sensitivity and ease-of-use, and reducing cost.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The problem with this approach is that general reviews and ratings do not take specific wine preferences into account. WineLog's recommendation system allows users to compare their recorded comments and ratings to those of other WineLog users. For example, if two users both highly rate one brand of chardonnay, then it is likely that they will also enjoy other similar types of chardonnay. Their respective WineLogs display the chardonnays highly rated by the other user and proposes them as wines that they may also enjoy. The more wines users enter into their log, the more specific their wine recommendations will be.
