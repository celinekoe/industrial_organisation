Cochiti, the northernmost Keresan Pueblo in New Mexico, is located in Sandoval and Santa Fe Counties, approximately 13 miles northwest of Interstate 25 and 35 miles southwest of Santa Fe, New Mexico. The topographic elevation varies from 5300 to 6800 feet above mean sea level and is characterized by the Rio Grande, which flows through reservation lands.  The principal land use includes farming, livestock, recreational, economic development, and agricultural and Pueblo home/residential construction purposes.  The demographic breakdown includes: 880 acres for agricultural; 4,443 acres of lake areas and wild river Bosque/wetlands; 7,042 acres dedicated to economic development consisting of residential and commercial lease properties and a golf course; and 41,424 acres of rangeland, pinion/juniper woodlands and Pueblo and residential use lands.  The people of Cochiti continue to retain their native language of Keres.  They maintain their cultural practices and have instituted programs dedicated to teaching and educating the younger generation Pueblo traditions and cultural practices emphasizing the native language.  Cochiti is well known for their craftsmanship in making jewelry, pottery, (storyteller), and drums.  Water in the Rio Grande, flows through Pueblo lands and is intermittently stored behind Cochiti Dam, which at a maximum capacity stores 502,330 acre feet of water known as Cochiti Reservoir. Cochiti has recently developed a Farm Enterprise Plan, which included the restoration of large acreage’s of traditional farmland inundated by seepage caused by the storage of water behind Cochiti Dam.  The reclamation of these lands, in cooperation with the US Army Corps of Engineers, (COE), was completed in September of 1994. The Santa Fe River which headwaters in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains east of Santa Fe NM flows downstream through Santa Fe NM, La Cienega, NM and finally into pueblo lands at the mouth of La Bajada Canyon.  The river flows through Pueblo lands and discharges into the Rio Grande several miles hence. Historically, Cochiti has had no private employers or economic enterprises.  This was changed with the Pueblo’s acquisition of the Town of Cochiti Lake and the creation of Cochiti Community Development Corporation, (CCDC) in 1995.  The Town of Cochiti Lake was established under a 99-year lease agreement with private investors to establish residential housing units under a strict building code and relative covenants.  The property has been under the direct management of Cochiti since the early 1980’s and has been a primary revenue source for the community. Of primary importance to the Pueblo de Cochiti are the land, air and water on and adjacent to the reservation, which is the lifeline of the Pueblo Traditions and Culture. The Pueblo is located in the heart of the traditional homeland and it would be impossible to retain peoples and culture if the environment is impacted to the point where the Cochiti decide the land is dangerous to utilize for habitat, farming, fishing, hunting, and maintaining Cultural Tradition.","Agriculture and Farming, Community and Lifestyle, Other, Real Estate",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

When you update your profile on mEgo it updates your avatar profile on all your online properties. This will allow people to have one consistent, updated profile as they join, enhance and migrate from social network to social network.  mEgo founder Ariel McNichol previously created popular software, games, and mobile products for Yahoo, AOL, Lucas Arts and Disney, and her co-founder Julia Johnston was a ""lawyer and highly accomplished business strategist in the technology, media and telecommunication industries."" Ariel started working on prototypes for creating, managing and updating online profiles back in 1999. Their new online profile avatar mEgo's revenue model consists of a blend of advertising, sponsorship, referral revenue and ecommerce.  In addition, mEgo will offer users the chance to allocate a portion of advertising revenue generated by their mEgos to a non-profit cause of their choice.  The company's growth will come from viral marketing and promotion and distribution deals with social networks and other sites.  Future plans include adding the following features: expanded widget support, enhanced visuals, non-avatar profile for professional networking, browser sidebar profile and a mobile mEgo.

DRA works with companies in many industries along with specializing in professional liability for architects, engineers, environmental consultants and other design firms. DRA works with more than 4,000 firms with offices throughout the country. DRA's professional singular focus is on strategically partnering with clients to develop risk management and insurance programs specific to the unique requirements of their individual firms and risk tolerance. Services The Application.  DRA provides extensive assistance to policyholders at inception and renewal time by clarifying and explaining questions on the application. This service is routinely afforded during visits to clients’ offices by DRA Account Executives and by DRA Account Managers during phone consultations. Educational Programs.  DRA is a strong supporter of loss prevention education programs. We conduct a quarterly series of practice management seminars in our Oakland Office, some of which qualify for continuing education credits. Additional counseling is available from DRA for firms who request more in-depth assistance in critical areas. Contract Review.  DRA’s Contract Analyst reviews our clients’ contracts for uninsurable clauses or areas of unusually great liability, suggesting alternatives to objectionable clauses, suggesting language to specifically protect the design professional and assisting in negotiations with the owner. This service does not constitute legal advice, but our clients have told us they place a high value on this loss prevention counseling. Loss Prevention Training.  DRA staff is very experienced in the exposures faced by design professionals and utilizes this background to provide helpful loss prevention counseling to our policyholders. Our Contract Analyst or Account Executives provide this service during phone consultations or “brown bag” lunch workshops. Coverage Review.  DRA staff is thoroughly schooled in the professional liability coverages needed by design professionals. Our Account Executives routinely review coverage issues in such areas as contractual liability, design/build projects, joint ventures, equity interest, and specific project insurance. Claims Monitoring.  DRA’s Claims Manager counsels our clients on reporting of claims. We can also serve as an advocate with the insurance company should they not respond properly to a claim. Due to the sensitive nature of professional malpractice claims, and the complexity of errors and omissions policies, the specifics and timing of the claim report can be critical. Our policyholders rely on our claims department’s expertise in both the initial reporting and follow through on claims.","Financial Services, Health Care, Professional Services",,,101-250,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
