We’re glad you asked… the CitySlips “story” is one of our favorites!!! Having lived in the city for three years as NYU students, Susie Levitt and Katie Shea were oh-so-familiar with the pain caused by pointy pumps and strappy stilettos. Their love/hate relationship with these fashion icons wasn’t helped by the fact that these petite powerhouses both stand no taller than 5’2”. Despite their suffering, they simply were unwilling to (totally) give up on these beloved wardrobe staples. And yet, corporate internships, subway dashes, dinner dates, the NYC social scene… all of the above led to too many moments of hobbling, near tears, back to their Union Square apartments. The front door never seemed to come soon enough. One too many encounters with shoeless socialites and barefooted babes led to their AH HA moment... CitySlips was born. These entrepreneurial sole-sisters came up with a concept and design that allowed women to carry back-up ballet flats comfortably, compactly, and conveniently. Juggling classroom term papers and corporate term sheets throughout their senior year of college, Susie and Katie enlisted the opinions of friends, the help of NYU professors, and the time of many NYC professionals and mentors. Nine months later (their baby, literally!), they now have a product that is funk-tional, fashionable and affordable! They’re confident that all of you well-heeded women on-the-go will enjoy these fabulous sole savers.","Clothing and Apparel, Commerce and Shopping, Community and Lifestyle, Design",2,"Katie Shea, Susie Levitt",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
