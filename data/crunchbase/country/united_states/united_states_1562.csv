The early years saw many research and development contracts.  R & D work led naturally to production contracts, and Hanley quickly became a trusted source for explosive components for artillery and bomb fuzes. When, in 1961, John F. Kennedy set the nation upon the path to the moon, NASA called upon Hanley to design and manufacture explosive bolts critical to the safety of the astronauts. With the onset of the Vietnam War, Hanley began to get more production contracts.  In time Hanley transitioned to a 3-shift operation, producing 40,000 detonators per day, week after week. By 1980 Hanley had outgrown its original grounds and the move was made to the present facility.  In 2001 additional land was purchased for future expansion. Recently Hanley has expanded its capabilities.  With the addition of personnel and additional equipment Hanley has become active in the CAD PAD market.

Unfortunately, there wasn't any. Not that I was even picky- I would have settled for something without all the cool jquery and whatnot, but nope. nothing. And so began the birth of card.ly- We went through a few domains also while in beta. First we were profileist.com (until I realised it should technically be profilist.com, which was taken) and uxCard.com (which I was informed was impossible to remember). Card.ly stuck- I am sure it had something to do with bit.ly being a big site in the .ly space, but who knows.

They research and experiment to achieve proof of concept and extract lessons that can be built to scale by their partners, who apply their insights in the marketplace.  Globally, about 1.7 billion people have no financial account -- at a bank, mobile money provider or other formal institution. Even when they have accounts, many poor people find them of little value and they are left unused. The result is that roughly one in three of the world’s adult population lacks the financial services they could use to dramatically improve their lives. They have no savings for a child’s education; they cannot access loans to buy the seeds and fertilizers; and they have no insurance to protect them from medical or natural disasters.","Financial Services, Media and Entertainment",,,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
