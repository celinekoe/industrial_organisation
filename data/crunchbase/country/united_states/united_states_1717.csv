All photos and content added to LifeGoRound gets an auto-URL-shortener, as well as the ability with 1-click to send to twitter or facebook.   There are a growing amount of ""widgets"" within LifeGoRound that allow you to view your twitter feeds, facebook news/updates and local weather as a looping slideshow. You can add an unlimited amount of RSS feeds (pure photos as well as text and photo feeds) from your favorite sources of content, and we give you a starter selection as we scoured the internet for you: http://lifegoround.com/blog/rss-feeds/ The fun begins when you add friends and groups to LifeGoRound.  To share content with ""friends"" you simply drag and drop the content onto your ""friends"" mug shot (profile image:-)  You can also create ""Groups"" so you can share with more than one friend with a single drag and drop.  The clever ""Group"" functionality also answers that age-old digital camera issue of how all people snapping photos at an event can easily and simply share the photos with everyone at the event (such as the Thanksgiving family gathering or the kids soccer game).   While LifeGoRound is a stand-alone social media sharing platform, we have also developed the technology to allow a LifeGoRound-enabled device, such as a ""Digital Photo Frame"" to automatically receive and ""stream"" the content from your LifeGoRound.  Sharing photos with friends and family has never been easier or more fun.  As soon as they are shared within LifeGoRound, they show up auto-magically on their â€œeMotion Social-Connect Digital Photo Frameâ€, in real-time...

We are surrounded by many apple farms including our close neighbor Beak & Skiff. At HillTop Farm, we raise a variety of Pheasants, Waterfowl, Peafowl, Pigeons and some Chickens. When available, we sell eggs, chicks, adult birds and breeders. All our bird aviaries and pens have fresh running water with plenty of natural cover to make them feel safe and home. Our ponds are large and deep enough for waterfowl to enjoy diving. All our birds are full-wing and fly around in our aviaries. All birds with possibility of cross breeding are separated into isolated pens during the breeding season. Our birds are very winter hardy. On an average, we receive 160 inches of snow per year and our temperature can go down to -20 during some nights. Yet, we still get 3 to 5 weeks of hot and humid weather during the summer months with temperature close to 100. Our aviaries have shelters for the birds to escape from storms and blizzards. Fresh running water along with aeration keep the ponds open during the winter months. All waterfowl are raised on Mazuri Waterfowl Starter feed for a good and healthy start along with plenty of boiled eggs. Many birds hatch their own young, some by broody chickens and some in our incubator. Regardless of how they are hatched, all young birds are hand raised making them more friendly towards people.","Agriculture and Farming, Food and Beverage",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
