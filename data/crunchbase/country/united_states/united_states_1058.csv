They have no co-pays, no-deductiables, no insurance headaches at all.     In their model the provider is free to deliver real personalized care to their members. An insurance company is not making the decisions about their member's health care. Those decisions are between the patient and the provider, like they should be. Their members receive unlimited visits and around the clock access to their provider. They make house calls, at no additional cost, if their members are too sick to come to the office. One of their medical staff will over see a member's care if they should need to be hospitalized, in person. The level of care they provide is unparalleled.    The average wait time national to see a primary care provider is nineteen days with an average of office visit of eight to twelve minutes. That is not health care. That is sickness management, at best! They are all acutely aware of the heath care crisis facing their country. Their is a huge shortfall of primary care providers and that shortage is increasing daily. There are less and less providers and more and more people in need of and gaining access to health care insurance. The health care bases primary care insurance model is broken.
