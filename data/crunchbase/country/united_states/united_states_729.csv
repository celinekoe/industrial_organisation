The B2B buying journey is more complex and multifaceted than it’s ever been. Sales cycles are longer and more individuals are involved in buying decisions, each with their own roles and priorities. They’ve also entered a new era where buyers are discovering and learning about companies through multiple online touchpoints, making content the centerpiece of their buying journey. These changes require that successful B2B marketers be buyer-centric. To rise above the noise and drive engagement and consensus among the multiple people (personas) in an account, marketers must provide high-quality content, messaging, and interactions that support buyers’ needs and processes in the manner they desire. Achieving this, however, is dependent on having a truly deep understanding of your buyers. The challenge marketers face is that existing technologies do not fully support this shift from being vendor-centric to buyer-centric because they’re solely focused on execution. While content production, account-based marketing, and personalization solutions exist, none of them can be used to their potential without first having Marketing-Sales alignment on the audience, how they buy, and how to effectively sell to them.

By developing solid-state production methods to improve electrodes, the company produces batteries using less energy, materials, and equipment. Intecells is breaking manufacturing out of its decades-long stasis toward a future full of new products and capabilities. Founded in 2018, Intecells invented solid-state printing techniques leveraging cold plasma to fundamentally change the way electrodes are shaped and built into flexible cell formats. The company is revolutionizing what is possible not only for manufacturing and environmental impact but also for consumer product creation for years to come. Partnering with leading battery makers, OEMs, and academic institutions, Intecells plans to bring its innovations from lab to production in 2022. The startup is the brainchild of Dr. Shawn Gayden, a Chinese American inventor, and business executive, who led battery manufacturing research for more than a decade, and Christian Buske, a German entrepreneur whose company first commercialized cold plasma technology decades ago. Intecells’ technologies eliminate binders and solvents for a cleaner electrode-making process, thereby opening new paths for a wide range of cell chemistries and applications across sectors at low production costs.     This game-changing endeavor is a rising tide that lifts everyone in the value chain. For materials and equipment suppliers, collaborating with Intecells adds value to products; for cell manufacturers, applying Intecells’ technology means they can write the rules for future battery production; and for OEMs, Intecells innovations eliminate many traditional and costly design constraints.  By adapting proven cold plasma technology to solve new problems, Intecells’ technology allows the battery to follow product form, not the other way around. The company’s new technology shrinks battery size, with limitless possibilities for shape, while retaining the same power output for less money. In the short term, Intecells is working to demonstrate its flexible batteries that offer personalization for a new wave of consumer products.  The company’s long-term goal is to revolutionize the electric vehicle battery industry and accelerate renewable energy storage. Today, the company creates bespoke technology for customers seeking to improve manufacturing processes and economic outcomes.","Energy, Manufacturing",2,"Christian Buske, Xiaohong Gayden",1-10,1,Seed,1999999,USD,1999999,1999999,USD,1999999,Walden International,1,1,,Private,,,,,,

Relationships matter. Sometimes in the hi-tech world they live in today, it’s easy to forget that. But they have always been keenly aware that the point of a good CRM system is to help build better relationships, and that all of their features should meet that criteria. After years of success in the recruitment industry, the founders of TrackerRMS grew increasingly frustrated that the CRM systems available in the market weren’t really built from a recruitment industry insider’s perspective.  There were a lot of venture-funded CRM platforms targeting the industry with big investments backing them, but none of them really seemed to ‘get’ the business from the perspective of someone that was actually in the trenches of the industry every day. So after six successful years of owning and running a recruitment business, David Alonso decided to sell and form TrackerRMS with Andy Jones, committed to building a CRM that is 100% focused on the recruitment industry, and has equal focus on relationships and the bottom line.  Their mutual passion for recruitment and building better business systems provided the fuel to get TrackerRMS started, and they quickly launched their initial product with good traction straight away.  Customers understood that the founders of TrackerRMS knew the market well, and realized that their personal experience helped build a product that would work for recruiters as well as business owners.  At TrackerRMS, their team is committed to always remembering that relationships are the foundation of success for their customers.  Their vision is to continue to support the SMB space and to help them grow their recruitment businesses by using TrackerRMS to build better relationships and to run their operations more effectively--the end result being increased growth and profitability, which is what their customers are all ultimately after.","Information Technology, Professional Services, Sales and Marketing, Software",2,"Andy Jones, David Alonso",11-50,4,Seed,917500,USD,917500,917500,USD,917500,,,,,Private,,,,,,

When you ask us what home is, we don’t have an easy answer. It’s complicated. We have the city we chose to live in and call home, and then we have our culture, the country we come from, which we call home as well. And it’s a big part of our identity, it’s who we are. Homeis was created to help people like us, who belong here and there, and feel that the Internet is undeserving them. We’ve witnessed how difficult it is for local foreign-born communities to digitally connect, share their culture, their local knowledge, and unique context. We saw how important these communities are in one’s life, how supportive they can be, and how effective their common wisdom can be to its members. So we decided it’s time to give foreign-born communities a dedicated comprehensive product. A product that understands them really well, and most importantly - empowers them. It’s what we’re here for. While local culture networks have always existed, our mission is to use technology and innovation to turn these invisible groups into visible communities. Homeis was founded in Feb 2017 in NYC and Tel Aviv. We’ve launched our first community in Dec 2017, and are planning to open many more in the next months. As most foreign-born people, we are BIG dreamers.
