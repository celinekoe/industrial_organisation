A vision of high quality, dramatic machinima, Lethal Lens produced its flagship title, Lethal Ladies using Battlefield 3 and publishing on YouTube. Our flagship title, Lethal Ladies, received a cult following after only one episode. Although, most of the original staff and employees on Lethal Ladies moved on to bigger and better ventures, Lethal Lens continued development. After a short while, Pixel Enemy caught interest and tried to help maneuver the company out of a creative rut. They were able to help immensely, however after a short time, the company decided to move away from making machinimas. In January 2013, Lethal Lens moved onto creating a show called Beer vs Game. Although the concept was different and fresh, it still struggled to catch viewers. Our company is still persevering today. Our latest venture into gaming has brought about the concept of a video game, Project Icarus. Our CEO is confident that he can acquire a team of like-minded individuals in order to bring this incredible game concept to life. Project Icarus is a First Person, Multiplayer, Sci-Fi, Shooter game which has already caught the attention of some great indie game reviewers who are quite anxious to see its final production. Lethal Lens is currently looking to extend its hand to students and aspiring game-designers alike on this project by introducing them into a career path they have always dreamed of. We are looking for bright, energetic, and highly motivated individuals with the creativity that can help us turn this exciting indie game-concept into a reality.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment, Video",1,Kenny Gazko,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

If carefully planned, intensively researched and well- executed, these returns can last up to 30 years or longer.      Risk Reduction Strategies. The most proven strategy to minimizing risk in a prospective oil and natural gas production venture is to drill in areas where there are known and producing oil and natural gas reserves. While easily stated, the research required on current area production, past production and gathering seismic and other geologic information is extensive and time-consuming…there are no shortcuts. Expertise combined with the patience to follow a rigorous process of due diligence and research are prerequisites of any very successful project.      A successful investment strategy is focused on “Inside Developmental” wells, versus exploratory wells; simply stated, drilling wells in areas where there are other wells known to have been producing, or currently producing, from the target formation.    New technologies have created investment opportunities as rarely seen in the oil industry. Investors in professionally managed companies that follow prudent strategies, have an opportunity to develop profitable oil and natural gas portfolios.
