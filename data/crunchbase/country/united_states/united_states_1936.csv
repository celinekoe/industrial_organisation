Harvey Mathis and the late C. Mack Taylor.  Harvey joined the Atlanta real estate firm Gearon & Company in 1967 and was followed by Mack Taylor who joined the firm in 1969.  After purchasing the interests of the other partners at Gearon, they renamed the firm Taylor & Mathis in 1972.  While with Gearon & Company, they were involved in the development of Executive Park in Atlanta, which is recognized as one of the first major suburban office parks in the nation. Building upon the experience gained in developing Executive Park, Taylor & Mathis teamed up with financial partner MetLife in the early 1970’s and began developing Perimeter Center in north central Atlanta.  Over the next 25 years, the company developed 30 single-tenant and multi-tenant office buildings at Perimeter Center totaling over 3.5 million square feet.  Due to its pioneering development of Perimeter Center – which became a prototype for other large-scale, master-planned office parks across the country – Taylor & Mathis was named Developer of the Year by the National Association of Industrial and Office Parks (NAIOP) in 1986, and became the Association’s first award winner that was not a national developer. Taylor & Mathis expanded throughout the 1980’s and 1990’s to pursue other development opportunities (including industrial and mixed-use projects), enter new markets (with projects in Florida, Alabama and North Carolina) and grow its third-party property management and leasing business. Mack Taylor’s son, Andrew Taylor, became President of the company in 1995.  Under his leadership, Taylor & Mathis has remained one of the most active developers in the Southeast -- having completed new office, industrial and mixed-use projects totaling 8.8 million square feet since 1995 – and has continued to selectively add new third-party clients that offer opportunities to strategically build upon the firm's stable foundation.",Real Estate,1,T.

The Airius sales, marketing, and operations teams took over the second floor of Avedon's machining and mold-making tool room, across the street from the plastics, assembly, and warehousing operations. Today, they design, manufacture, assemble, and sell over 450 SKUs of Airius units, from the original Air Pear to specialty units like their Retail Series. And, while the original Air Pear only came in one size, the perfect size for their own building, they now offer a range of fans that fit buildings with ceilings from 8 ft. to over 100 ft. tall.","Energy, Manufacturing, Real Estate",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
