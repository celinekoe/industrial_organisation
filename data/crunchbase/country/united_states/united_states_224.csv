We focus particularly on providing answers to questions surrounding the book of Genesis, as it is the most-attacked book of the Bible. We also desire to train others to develop a biblical worldview, and seek to expose the bankruptcy of evolutionary ideas, and its bedfellow, a “millions of years old” earth (and even older universe). AiG teaches that “facts” don’t speak for themselves, but must be interpreted. That is, there aren’t separate sets of “evidences” for evolution and creation—we all deal with the same evidence (we all live on the same earth, have the same fossils, observe the same animals, etc.). The difference lies in how we interpret what we study. The Bible—the “history book of the universe”—provides a reliable, eye-witness account of the beginning of all things, and can be trusted to tell the truth in all areas it touches on. Therefore, we are able to use it to help us make sense of this present world. When properly understood, the “evidence” confirms the biblical account. For an elaboration of AiG’s presuppositional thrust check out our Answers section—for example, learn how the Bible offers the best explanation of the world’s geology, astronomy, and genetics. Also, for information on the issues we deal with and which ones we don’t, see “Where Do We Draw the Line?”","Other, Social Impact",1,Ken Ham,251-500,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
