In 2009, after being unable to find a website that would simply ""red flag"" news and opinion as a warning of corrupt politics or a problem with news media bias, J.R. Elliott began work on the website that is now RedFlag News— contributing thousands of unpaid hours away from his own family and career to bring the news to the website's loyal readers. With his knack of finding good stories and sources (financed by the spare change found in the couches of his home), RFN has blossomed into a product that powers tens of thousands of independent thinkers’ news addiction and currently serves more than two million of hits per month. Deﬁned by J.R. Elliott's insistence on a news aggregation website that provides an unparalleled user experience from a robust core, every pixel of RedFlagNews.com is engineered with the mindset that the interface will be timeless, creative, and delightful. That mindset, along with his execution, has allowed RFN to grow organically without any advertising and prove to be a wise choice for those looking to expand their news experience outside the liberal mainstream media. Because RFN is clearly focused on conservative news and opinion, and the multiple tangents the Conservative Movement offers, its audience is conveniently focused, yet broad within its borders. RFN is popular with bloggers, Pinterest and Facebook users — an increasingly influential demographic — together with: • early adopters of sites like Drudge Report, Breitbart and Huffington Post; • almost half of the United States Congress; • news junkies like ourselves; • journalists and nationally syndicated talk radio hosts; • super PACs and political campaigns; • members of the Independent, Libertarian, Conservative, and Tea Party movements. A majority of RFN visitors come to its site to find the latest in breaking news and opinion. Its audience is completely devoted to and immersed in what the Conservative Movement has to offer. They are concerned Americans who are highly engaged, activism minded and thoroughly aware of current events. 97% share and connect with RFN via social media. 67% of the RFN readers visit the website daily, or multiple times a day, and 30% visit weekly.","Content and Publishing, Government and Military, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment",1,J.R.
