Our goal is to provide a variety of medical settings with experienced, screened and effective physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists and their respective therapy assistants. Our primary objective is to help clients’ medical facilities provide patients with the highest quality in healthcare services and to improve their quality of life. We achieve this through hand-selecting top therapists and therapy assistants for your jobs. Our people have the right skills, training, licensure, personality and abilities to make a positive impact on their work environment and their patients. Powered by Experience From the mid to late ‘90s, careers in rehabilitation healthcare were among the fastest growing sectors and continue to be today. Similarly in the ‘90s, acceptance of using medical staffing services began to grow. While many medical staffing organizations were focusing on the larger field of nursing, TheraStaff elected to narrow its focus to serve physical, occupational and speech rehabilitation therapy. In 2009, TheraStaff merged with The Eastridge Group of Staffing Companies founded in 1972 by Robert Svet to become TheraStaff LLC. Eastridge is one of the nation’s largest privately held staffing companies, backed by nearly 40 years of staffing expertise and a network of colleagues adding value and depth to rehabilitation staffing services. As a specialty division of Eastridge, clients of TheraStaff LLC have access to a multitude of workforce resources, including a sister medical staffing division that places Medical administrative support, clinicians such as physician assistants, nurses practitioners and more. Our family of staffing companies also includes a technology staffing division that’s experienced in the healthcare field, and a human resources staffing division with years of expertise in supporting the medical field. We’re proud of the work we do and the area of medicine we support. In order to provide the very best physical, occupational, speech and physical therapy staffing services, a steadfast mission backs our agency, along with an enduring value system.

Simons entered into an agreement with two other men to start a Lawrence newspaper more than 100 years ago, he had no idea he was laying the financial and philosophical foundation for a multimedia company that would some day be one of the most innovative and technologically advanced and locally owned media companies in the United States. The World Company is the leading news source in the Lawrence community, employing nearly 300 people in a variety of departments that support its multimedia endeavors. And being on that cutting-edge didn't happen by accident. Today, it is fashionable for newspaper publishers to call for better ways to serve readers and advertisers. But when Dolph C. Simons Jr., (grandson of W.C. Simons and the editor and publisher of the Lawrence Journal-World since 1962) addressed the issue at a 1991 event celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Simons' family entry into the news business, he sounded like a prophet. ""They believe it is important to look upon Their business as an 'information business,' not merely a newspaper or a cable television operation,"" Simons said. ""They want to stay abreast of new developments and be able to deliver news and advertising, as well as other information, however a reader or advertiser might desire."" That easily explains why The World Company has been so aggressive at embracing new technology and ideas.
