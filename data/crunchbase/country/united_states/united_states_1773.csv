We are able to do this by partnering with providers so they may offer services directly to the patient.

At consumer Internet companies big and small, the drive to find scalable and repeatable ways to gain customers is blurring the lines between marketing, product management, and engineering. We're seeing a new role emerge across Silicon Valley: the ""growth hacker"" and entire growth teams are combining quantitative direct marketing techniques, data modeling, relentless testing, and the harnessing of distribution existing networks. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Airbnb are just a few companies who've grown to millions of users with this new breed of marketers leading the charge. Growth Hackers Conference is an event for technology entrepreneurs, marketers, developers, and investors to learn from the best growth hackers in Silicon Valley.   Guests hear from the best growth hackers in the business, including the founders of the growth teams at Facebook and Twitter, the co-founder and CTO of LivingSocial, the CEO of KISSMetrics and other leading thinkers and entrepreneurs. Our speakers will cover everything from how to make sure the right growth engine is embedded at the core of a product to how they've skyrocketed customer numbers once product-market fit is already working.   The first conference was hosted on Friday, October 26 at the Quadrus Conference Center in Menlo Park and attendees heard from speakers with track records of success in building businesses using growth hacking techniques.","Education, Events, Media and Entertainment, Software",2,"Erin Turner, Gagan Biyani",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
