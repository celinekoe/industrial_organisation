A common approach to building an easy-to-use reporting system is to cut an enterprise system down to size by restricting features and providing a lot of pre-canned content. They tried that, and found it was almost, but not quite, good enough: in too many cases they had to drop down to custom code to get everything they needed, and that wiped out most of our productivity gains. Panamplify is taking a different approach: building systems that know enough about the domain being reported on to operate at a higher level of abstraction.
