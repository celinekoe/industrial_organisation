These business goals are attainable, since all of the key strategic positions for success – expertise, technologies, site advantages, and the energy market– are favorable.    Solar Power Holding, LLC was established on April 02, 2015 as an LLC with its registered office in Newark, Delaware (USA). The company will become active in the photo¬voltaics (PV) market in Italy. The key individual of the company is its CEO, Simon Grossgasteiger, who has many years of expertise and is fully familiar with the Italian market. To complement the company's core competencies, cooperation with the following two companies will be entered into: Windsolar GmbH, Italy, and Verotec GmbH, Italy.    Italy has the electric power market with the highest prices in Europe and is growing by 6 to 9% annually.    Solar Power Holding, LLC will acquire non-performing, undervalued operating companies of PV plants (mergers & acquisitions). Maintenance of the PV plants will be performed in cooperation with Windsolar GmbH and Verotec GmbH. The Italian Gestore Servizi Energetici (GSE) guarantees that it will purchase the power generated at set prices. Since existing PV plants are already connected to the grid and the purchase of the power is guaranteed, further measures for transferring the generated power or for distribution will not be required.    Non-performing, undervalued PV plant operating companies will be acquired, updated, and optimized. This is more profitable than building new plants. The acquisition will be performed in three steps: due diligence, acquisition, and updating and optimizing. A due diligence process has already been performed, and data are already present on operating companies that can be taken over.","Energy, Natural Resources, Sustainability",1,Simon Grossgasteiger,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
