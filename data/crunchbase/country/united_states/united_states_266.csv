Doing business as StylizeNOW, our platform provides on-demand services that cater to customers’ residences. For now, the platform focuses on salon services; haircuts, hair coloring, nail services, and eyelash care. StylizeNow contracts with licensed professionals that agree to provide these services to customers that use the StylizeNow mobile application. Similar to other on-demand service providers, our company does not employ these professionals but contracts with individual professionals that provide these services and send them to customers that use our platform. This platform specifically is not an online marketplace but an on-demand service. Customers simply go on our platform and select what service they desire, and our platform will immediately begin to set them up with a provider and send this provider to their homes. We feel that given the extraordinary times we live in, coupled with the rise in sharing services and the git economy, not to mention that a lot of the professionals in these fields are currently out of work, due to shutdowns, that the times leave open a promising opportunity to allow customers to avoid the hazards of going inside an indoor public space with dozens or even hundreds of people. Also, our platform allows these professionals to continue earning money while the shutdowns continue. We hope that it will catch on and eventually we can expand beyond merely salon services to other industries and customers will continue to like the service even after the end of the shutdowns and we return to normal activity. Our platform is currently available to customers in the San Antonio and Austin metro areas with the goal of expanding if business allows. We eventually hope to expand statewide and afterward nationally.

The project will be launched in two stages. The first stage is a concierge service IamOn, which helps contractors find clients and build user interest in the business model. This will be launched in May 2015. At the same time the team is working on the second stage of the project that includes the architectural design of the decentralized blockchain platform.  It is based on the blockchain system, which enables users to collaborate through smart contacts.  The platform is a distributed, community-owned database. It has improved security, and does not rely on external resources. The launch date for the second stage will be announced later in 2015. IamOn plans to become a global, decentralized service exchange, where the search for professionals and clients will be implemented with help of database mining algorithms at the level of secured P2P processes. The platform takes people out of the loop and passes the work to an automated system, which will synchronize client requests with contractor data in real time and find the most relevant offers to create a match. There are four simple steps to connect a potential client with a service provider: A business owner registers their initial data including location, type of services, price list and other information that will be used as a filter. A potential client creates an contract, indicating their own criteria and the timeframe. All the information will sit on a cryptographic blockchain, which means that nobody will be able to access it. Whenever a client and a service provider are matched with the help of data mining algorithms, only the part of the information that is necessary and public will be available between them. The client and the potential contractor can communicate privately and make a deal in terms of contract. The IamOn platform solves the problems of both parties. It offers SMB a free channel to interact with customers and it provides customers with up-to-date information and a quick contractor search with no hidden fees. Features: • All system participants are businesses and clients and can independently manage their privacy level.   • The system will have internal tokens, Bitcoins, to prevent abuse. People will be awarded Bitcoins for hosting the blockchain which they can spend to create or accept a contract. This approach will prevent hacking and spam. • Third-party services are able to create applications for blockchain collaboration though an open API.","Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Data and Analytics, Financial Services, Information Technology, Other, Payments, Software",2,"Anastasiia Bilous, Vadim Rozov",1-10,1,Seed,300000,USD,300000,300000,USD,300000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The firm, led by president Todd Mardis, works with a two-pronged approach: to create legally sound tax savings strategies for its clients while helping them plan business marketing efforts that can leverage these cost savings to reinvest in long-term growth and consolidation. The Capital Preservation Services team also offers clients expertise in the related areas of estate planning, wealth management, non-qualified deferred compensation planning, and more.   As a client of Capital Preservation Services, high-earning middle-class professionals (doctors, dentists, lawyers, and business owners, for example) can take advantage of the tax strategies that typically save extraordinarily wealthy individuals and international corporations millions—if not billions—of dollars a year.   The typical working professional or entrepreneur lacks the time and expertise to pore over the granular details of the United States Tax Code to identify every requirement that must be followed and every potential avenue for legal tax savings. Fortunately, CPS team members are familiar with the specific business and financial circumstances facing each client, enhancing the firm’s capacity to deliver highly customized solutions by zeroing in on the most beneficial code provisions.   Capital Preservation Services, building from a confidential questionnaire that begins the consultation process, becomes a client’s lead problem-solver in this regard. The firm’s professionals can pinpoint optimal ways to save their clients substantially in taxes, as well as in penalties assessed on earnings and assets, while remaining fully compliant.   And as part of its client appreciation efforts, Capital Preservation Services hosts an annual Tax Savings in the Sand conference, offering a range of informative presentations by experienced professionals.

It is a wholly owned subsidiary of [Koch Industries](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/koch-industries), and has independent leadership and separate financial decision-making authorities. Flint Hills Resources was named for the Flint Hills of Kansas, an area that features lush tall grass prairies, pristine natural springs and beautiful vistas. The company’s headquarters is in Wichita, Kan., near the Flint Hills. Flint Hills Resources is an independent refining, chemicals and biofuels company. It strives to create value for its customers and society – through the way its facilities operate, its efficient use of resources, the products it produces and markets, and its involvement in its communities. The company has expanded its operations through capital projects and acquisitions worth more than $7.6 billion since 2002. Its refineries produce fuels that power much of Texas, the Midwest and the Alaska interior. The company's ethanol and biodiesel plants produce fuels that are used across the United States. Its petrochemicals are used to manufacture goods from plastics to building products to packaging materials. The asphalt it produces is used in communities across the Midwest and Alaska. The base oils it markets are the principle raw material used to produce premium motor oil, commercial lubricants and sealants and coatings. Flint Hills Resources’ manufacturing capability is built upon six decades of refining experience. The company has expanded its production capacity – through acquisitions and capital projects – to meet customer needs in the markets it serves in Alaska, the Midwest and Texas, as well as the global polymers, olefins, aromatics and intermediate chemicals industries. With its strong manufacturing, marketing and product innovation capabilities, Flint Hills Resources’ employees work to anticipate customer demands and then efficiently and profitably meet those needs. Flint Hills Resources operates refineries in Alaska (North Pole), Minnesota (Rosemount) and Texas (Corpus Christi East and West) with a combined crude oil processing capacity of about 670,000 barrels of crude oil per day. These facilities are served by strategically located terminals and pipelines, some of which are operated by [Koch Pipeline Company, L.P.](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/koch-pipeline-company-l-p) Flint Hills Resources' interests in Canada include Calgary-based crude oil marketing, transportation and storage. Supply for the refineries is secured through crude oil purchasing offices located in Calgary, Denver and Houston.  Flint Hills Resources operates ethanol plants in Iowa (Fairbank, Iowa Falls, Menlo and Shell Rock) and Nebraska (Fairmont); and has a regional office in Ames, Iowa. The plants have a combined annual capacity of 550 million gallons of ethanol. Flint Hills Resources, a leading producer of transportation fuels in the Upper Midwest, is the largest purchaser of ethanol in Minnesota, where it has utilized ethanol and other biofuels in its fuel distribution system since the mid-’90s. The company also has made equity investments in bioenergy companies, and operates a biodiesel plant near Fort Worth, Texas. Flint Hills Resources is a leading producer of chemicals and related products with manufacturing facilities in Illinois, Michigan and Texas. The company produces aromatics, intermediates and EPS, olefins and polymers.

National Cabinet Lock, now CompX National, was founded in Rockford, Illinois in 1903. National Lock moved its cabinet lock manufacturing facility to Mauldin, South Carolina in 1982. National has always been known for its full product line of security locks, ranging from disc tumbler locks to pin tumbler locks. In 1998, CompX acquired Fort Lock, formerly located in River Grove, Illinois. Fort Lock, now CompX Fort, was founded in 1955. Fort added the Multi-Function cabinet locks with stainless steel caps to the STOCK LOCKS program. In 1999, CompX acquired Timberline Lock, formerly located in Lake Bluff, Illinois.

Take a look through our history to see what makes us stand out amongst our competitors. To understand why 2010 was such a big year for us on the frontiers of sustainability, it’s important to look where we’ve come from. Inpro Corporation was the first company in our industry to understand the importance of working toward sustainable and green initiatives.  We modestly started 15 years ago in 1995 with our industry’s first pre-consumer vinyl recycling process, followed in 1998 by being only the fifth manufacturer to embrace and join the USCGB.  In 2001 we launched Inpro’s EnviroGT™ line, our industry’s first non-PVC line of door and wall protection products as we began building our successful “Choices” program. That year we also launched our industry’s first post-consumer Vinyl Recycling Program.  In 2002 we introduced HDPE and Forest Stewardship Council wood into door and wall protection, followed in 2003 by a BuildingGreen Top-10 New Green Products Award.  In 2004 we delivered the industry’s first AIA-approved green continuing education program. In 2005, we introduced rapidly renewable bamboo into our EnviroGT line, followed in 2006 by beginning the manufacture of solid surface products to enhance sustainable building interiors.  Inpro was the first in our industry to introduce a line of BPA-free PETG products in 2007, which was the precursor to our remarkable 2010 breakthrough – the introduction of our exclusive G2 BioBlend™ made with a corn-based biopolymer. Unquestionably, this delivered the best green product in our markets.
