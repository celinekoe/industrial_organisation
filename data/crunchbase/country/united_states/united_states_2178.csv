ATI Networks,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ati-networks,E-Commerce Platforms,"Fond Du Lac, Wisconsin, United States",ATI Networks (ATIW) develops leading edge GPS and Internet software applications.,"1,335,453","Great Lakes, Midwestern US",,Active,1990-01-01,year,2012-11-07,day,,,For Profit,http://www.atinetworks.com/,"ATI Networks (ATIW) develops leading edge GPS and Internet software applications. These products are characterized by their ability to do a job more quickly, and by their new and unique way of representing the information to the user. This method of representing information will save the user time and reduce the frustration inherent in existing search methods. With its multi-market uses, ATI offers software solutions that truly set new standards while addressing the needs of the global wireless and online communities. ATI was established as a research and development Company to create and license leading edge software applications. In December of 1995, the Company's first product, AutoNav, was selected by Automotive Engineering Magazine readers as one of the Top 50 Products of the Year. In 1996, with its LogiTrak software, ATI became the first company in the world to enable wireless communications and tracking of a GPS enhanced wireless device over the INTERNET. In 1997, ATI expanded its Internet software presence by completing the development of two proprietary website properties. The first was a fully automated, global real estate exchange website known as ARealGem.com. The second was ArtGems.com, the first fully automated, online art auction on the Internet.  In 1998, ATI Networks, Inc. (OTC: ATIW) acquired all of the assets of ATI, Inc., and shortly thereafter became a fully reporting, public company. As part of this transaction, all prior shareholders of ATI, Inc. received one share in ATI Networks for each share of stock they owned in ATI, Inc. All prior shareholders of ATI, Inc. should contact American Securities Transfer, the company's transfer agent, to exchange old shares of ATI and receive new shares of ATI Networks. Any questions regarding this transaction should be directed to Mark Thatcher or Steve Sorenson, counsel for the company. In 1999 the company sold all rights to its GPS software products and focused its efforts on its e-commerce brands. As a result, company sales revenues were up over 4,000% by year end over 1998. ATI Networks is building a global e-business using its state of the art, online auction technology, proprietary web properties, and proven marketing techniques to create high volume, high profit margin, e-commerce websites. The company's websites offer everything from fine art to discount computers and computer peripherals, recycled automobiles and auto parts. The company's auction technology is now being used at www.artgems.com, a consumer website that sells fine art over the Internet. The company's future plans include providing an environment for electronic commerce to take place between insurance companies and auto parts dealers. Areas of the company's sites will also be available to the general public. The company plans to expand its existing online recycling business to provide a similar e-commerce environment for manufacturers of computers and electronic equipment to sell discounted excess inventory through the global network of 150,000 Value Added Resellers (VAR's). The company is using its proprietary online auction technologies and e-commerce websites, in which it utilized its web auction technology to produce over $4 million in 1999 online sales revenues. The company is positioning itself to become a leading discount place on the Internet.","Commerce and Shopping, Internet Services",,,11-50,1,IPO,1000000,USD,1000000,1000000,USD,1000000,VentureNet,1,1,1,Delisted,2012-11-07,,none,ATIW,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/ati-networks-ipo--813dbefe,OTC Pink
