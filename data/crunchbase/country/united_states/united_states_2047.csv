During this period, we also take an in depth look at your main competition to determine strengths and weaknesses (to emulate and exploit, respectively). Finally, we will provide comprehensive link building assessment that becomes the road map for new initiatives. Once the pay-per-click campaign has gathered enough data, we can make a strong determination of the keywords that we will focus on for organic search engine optimization. At this point, we fine tune your website with these keyword phrases in mind and begin the link building campaign. A truly comprehensive approach to SEO includes measures to monitor and protect your brand and keep existing customers happy. Chicago Style SEO will help you connect with customers and prospects on the major social media outlets.

A true, systemic solution would provide transparency about the value of an education and would appropriately allocate the risks and rewards of such an investment to all parties. So we designed one. We enable people to invest in students in exchange for a percentage of their future income. This provides downside risk protection to students, a novel asset class to investors, and signals about the ROI of that education to the market.

If wealth is defined as “the repertoire of physical transformations that one is capable of causing (David Deutsch)” then this reduction in friction should lead to a massive increase in wealth. Large projects are usually designed and managed from the top down. Cynch helps remove the top down nature of project management.  Once a project has been orchestrated and the work to be performed has been documented, Cynch will allow the work to be dynamically executed through a set of smart contracts.  These smart contracts allow for an approach to projects that we call “Just in Time Execution.” Blockchain technologies and the decentralization that they enable will create significant disruption across many industries in the coming years.  Fundamental to this movement is the ability to execute value transfers in a trustless environment.  Our CynchTask Contracts abstract work orchestration into a few basic api endpoints.  We pair this abstraction with a dynamic and robust orchestration platform, Cynch, that has its roots in robust project management system and is already in use by major corporations.  These orchestrations further enable capturing value in many ways including: Reduced friction in resource verification and compensation.   Define a blockchain of custody for work objects. Create a shared data space that streamlines auditing and the sharing of reports. Once an ecosystem of market participants develop around doing work on the Cynch platform we can create additional value by gamifying negotiations using a decentralized request for proposal(RFP) management platform. The system will eventually develop a rich set of data that can packaged and sold in a data market to project managers seeking to bid and scope upcoming projects. The Cynch system will be based upon an open source protocol that will allow third party developers to add value to the system by creating Dapps and other system integrations that are beyond the capacity and expertise of the core Cynch team.
