We created a Lifestyle brand whereby our community are just people like us, who want to fee empowered, loved, lifted, and be better prepared to take on the day tomorrow. We launched our wine brand in January of 2020 with our Côtes de Provence Rosé. Later that year, we brought to market our award-winning Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.  What makes our wine even more special than the quality in the bottle is our one-of-a-kind packaging. Every bottle comes with our patented rhinestone bracelet that decorates the neck of the bottle which can be removed to decorate your stemware. Our packaging continues to help our wine fly off the shelves and be a hit poolside or at the beach! We look forward to our continual growth in this super competitive industry. We continue to be amazed by the new relationships that we get to create. Relationships that really become lifelong friendships and family.
