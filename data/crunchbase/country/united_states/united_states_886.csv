We will store the users CC and shipping address and after payment confirmation route orders to suppliers. By eliminating the traditional e-commerce path to purchase we believe one-click buying will be a game changer in Mobile Commerce. We are implementing photo recognition recommendations. A user can take a photo of a shoe and our recommendation software will find similar shoes. This technology knows the difference between a high heel, sneaker, etc. Imagine being able to take a photo of a $500 shoe in a magazine and having similar shoes recommended at discount prices Our goal is to be the most advanced shopping App, helping users easily find and purchase from their phones.","Commerce and Shopping, Mobile",1,Jeremy Callahan,1-10,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
