Our obsession to entertain both the left and right sides of the brain will leave both the casual and maniacal fantasy enthusiasts on fire.

Unfortunately for the almost 30 million of us who play today, the industry remains largely stagnant; using the same tired search technology, stale graphics, and timid banter. Enter Pyromaniac.com. Our content will focus on preparing users to succeed in battle on draft day and each week during the season. Player profiles will read like statistical and analytical armories. Information will come from all angles with a visual assault on your senses. We want you to be a part of this community from the beginning; using our resources and staying with us as we grow into a full-service commissioner league by the 2010 season. At Pyromaniac.com, we are as devoted to our users as they are to football. We are a feedback driven community that will always remain responsive to your suggestions; even when we blow up like the LT's did in 2006 (31 TD's) and 1986 (20.5 sacks). Together we will leap into a brave new fantasy world; no longer constrained by yesterday's technology. Our promise to you; fantasy football will never look or feel the same way again.

Even with a “perfect” diet, the digestive tract doesn’t allow for full absorption of all the nutrients you take in daily. IV therapy is a great way to boost your health to new levels. Nutritional IVs are ideal for those who lead active lifestyles. If you need assistance in maintaining your energy or if you’re interested in preventive medicine through nutrition, IV therapy is for you. Nutritional intravenous therapy comes into play by getting the nutrients straight into your bloodstream. By bypassing the digestive system, you can achieve the most direct level of absorption. How IV Vitamin Therapy Works Vitamin IV therapy has been in use for many years, these treatments bring relief from aches & pains to other common deficiencies. The cells in your body require a delicate balance of specific vitamins & minerals to function efficiently. When one or more of these components are not at their ideal levels, some negative effects can occur within your body. This could lead to poor sleep quality, susceptibility to illness, fatigue, headaches, or even bouts of depression or anxiety. By replenishing your body with a concentration of the vitamins or minerals that it needs through IV therapy, balance can be restored. There are numerous benefits of intravenous therapy and are appreciated by many patients at our clinic. Some of the overall benefits include: increased hydration – improved sleep quality – reduced symptoms of stress, depression, and asthma, and an increase in energy levels Vitality Lounge Specializes in IV Therapy Treatment Vitality Lounge, under the supervision of Dr. Pejman Shirazy, can help you get back to your best self, especially after feeling tired, stressed, overworked, or from drinking too much alcohol the night before. Customized IV treatments can be formulated to replace any lost nutrients and vitamins quickly and effectively. Our different therapies are tailored to meet your specific needs. After receiving IV therapy, most patients feel energized for days with the effects increasing over time.",Health Care,,,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The current high mileage mandate for the automotive industry and the desire for “green” materials and energy saving processes have both created market demand  for Fibrtec’s products and technology, therefore Fibrtec is seeking growth capital to enter the mass production  automotive market and leverage its  global strong competitive advantages.  Fibrtec serves competitively today with composite solutions targeted at the oil and gas, automotive, military, aerospace, energy, medical and specialty sporting goods applications. Fibrflex® is Fibrtec’s core product. It is uniquely flexible and yarn-like and when weaved into fabric form, it readily adapts to the shape of a mold, where in the presence of heat and pressure it is converted into a lightweight high strength part. The process is quicker, the tooling cost is lower, and it offers substantive automation ideal for mass production. The lower energy requirement coupled with being fully recyclable bolsters its recognition and value in the market. Conversely, the competition’s material is a stiff rigid tape, which is brittle and cardboard like, and cannot easily be converted to complex shapes at low cost. Additionally, when Fibrflex® is combined with its patent-pending FireWind™ molding technology, it offers breakthrough manufacturing cycles with 10 –15 % lower cost and productivity rates 3-5 times higher.","Manufacturing, Transportation",,,11-50,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
