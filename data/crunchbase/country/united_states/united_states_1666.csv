Headquartered in Lake Forest, Illinois, we’ve had a 100% work-from-home workforce since our inception, and our employees are located nationwide. Our customers range from small companies to Global 500 companies in all industries and markets. Our journey with Salesforce began in 2008 when we started offering consulting services. In 2010, we launched what would eventually become our adaptable project management solution, Milestones PM+. When our first customer noticed a gap in the capabilities of our project management solution with syncing up the dates in their project plans, we explored what Salesforce had to offer and discovered we needed to build a custom solution. As it turns out, this date syncing problem uncovered a major unmet rollup and aggregation need on the Salesforce platform. To meet this need, in 2012 we decided to invest even more time and energy into the creation and launch of our flagship app Rollup Helper, which is the original Rollup Platform on the AppExchange. Rollup Helper took off, and its tremendous success inspired us to build more trustworthy apps and custom solutions for the Salesforce platform. The result? Our apps Rollup Helper, Lookup Helper, Storage Helper, and Milestones PM+ have all spent time in the Top 24 apps on the AppExchange.","Administrative Services, Information Technology, Other, Professional Services, Sales and Marketing, Software",2,"Brent Gossett, Jerry Reid",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Founded in 2010 and based in the heart of Silicon Valley, Engajer is a communication platform designed to take advantage of mega-trends in video and SaaS technology. Engajer is taking a fresh and different approach at how video can be used to sell and to promote. Whereas most sales and marketing videos in use today are lengthy and ineffectively designed to be “one size fits all,” Engajer’s platform limits video length to only 30 seconds much like a “tweet” constrains the number of characters. This enables the viewer to “choose their own adventure” by sequentially selecting a series of multiple short videos to watch that accommodate the viewer’s interests. Meanwhile, in the background, Engajer is tracking the viewer’s selections and activity while building out a comprehensive profile of the viewers overall level of interest.  This information is sent to sales reps so they may customize their follow- up calls with highly tailored information based on the customer’s specific interests. Engajer is being used in Sales, Marketing, and Training, but the company’s first focus is on improving Sales efficiency. They have achieved success serving large customers like SugarCRM and Fujitsu as well as numerous small and mid-sized businesses.","Media and Entertainment, Software, Video",1,Michael Castellano,1-10,2,Seed,1400000,USD,1400000,1400000,USD,1400000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Really. We are creating a line of products starting with the ModelOne. Reimagining the smoking paradigm, we wed modern technologies, materials and processes to the best tobacco and botanical ingredients. We handcraft our pods at our micro-factory in San Francisco. Ploom began as a conversation between a smoker and a non-smoker outside a studio at Stanford's Joint Program in Design in 2004. ""What do you hate about smoking?"" Adam asked. ""What do you love about it?"" James responded. The two had already been collaborating on eccentric thesis explorations but those were quickly dropped to answer the question: What if smoking were reinvented today? The thesis generated support from some of the most well respected thinkers and doers in and around the University. James and Adam founded Ploom in a tiny orange painted room on an apple orchard in Palo Alto, determined to bring a better alternative to people who love (and hate) smoking. Hundreds of prototypes, consumer insights and a business plan later, the two developed a unique startup in the historic Dogpatch area of San Francisco with a handful of the best engineers, advisors, marketing and biotech veterans in the country. The model One and Ploom's first six flavors are the first glimpse of the future of smoking: a new ritual for a modern society from a new kind of company.","Consumer Goods, Food and Beverage, Hardware, Health Care",2,"Adam Bowen, James Monsees",51-100,6,Late Stage Venture,,USD,,,USD,,Sand Hill Angels,,1,,Private,,,,,,
