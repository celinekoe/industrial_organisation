Urban Sprouts,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/urban-sprouts,"Agriculture, Association, Communities, Education, Food and Beverage, Health Care, Non Profit","San Francisco, California, United States",The mission of Urban Spouts is to plant the seeds of social equity to build healthy and thriving neighborhoods through community.,"1,920,129","San Francisco Bay Area, West Coast, Western US",Less than $1M,Active,2003-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,http://www.urbansprouts.org/,"Urban Sprouts works at the nexus of food, environment, community, health, and poverty—utilizing food and food gardens as relatable and relevant platforms for program participants to achieve greater access to fresh and healthy food, share learning, gain employment opportunities in the urban agriculture sector, and effect positive change in their homes and communities. Urban Sprouts educators create a context—in classrooms, in after school and summer youth programs, and in community settings—for program participants to understand the importance of fruits and vegetables in a healthy diet, to recognize health disparities that are linked to issues of food access, and to partner with Urban Sprouts to bring healthier food choices to their neighborhoods. Our programming reaches youth and adults from low-opportunity neighborhoods in San Francisco, racial and ethnic minority groups, English language learners, and youth in the juvenile justice system. The organization grew out of a doctoral dissertation project (Michelle Ratcliffe, Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, Tufts University) carried out during the 2003-04 school year at Luther Burbank Middle School in San Francisco—now June Jordan School for Equity. Dr. Ratcliffe and her collaborators developed and tested the poly-theoretical, behaviorally based, interdisciplinary framework—the Garden-Based Education Model—developed at the school. Teachers and administrators from the school invited the research team to stay on to transform the garden into a sustained program at the core of the school’s curriculum. Since our founding, Urban Sprouts has partnered with over 6,750 San Francisco students. Urban Sprouts delivers garden-based education to 500 middle and high school students at four San Francisco Unified School District schools—Aptos Middle School, International Studies Academy, June Jordan School for Equity, Log Cabin Ranch (the San Francisco Juvenile Probation Department's post-adjudication facility for male juveniles, which La Honda, CA [San Mateo County])—and during the summer. Urban Sprouts also reaches over 1,000 individuals and families annually through bilingual (English and Spanish language) programming that includes nutrition education, culturally appropriate cooking classes, exploration of healthy lifestyles, and support for individuals and families to improve food access and environmental justice in their communities. The programming addresses the linkages between food insecurity and purchasing decisions influenced by the unequal distribution of healthy food in San Francisco; the growing cost differential of healthy versus energy-dense foods that are high in added fat, refined carbohydrates, and sugar; and San Francisco’s growing economic divide. Urban Sprouts began a partnership in 2014 with Mercy Housing California, an organization that develops and manages affordable housing sites. We are working with members of the Mercy staff and with the residents of Sunnydale in San Francisco’s Visitacion Valley and residents of Bayview Hill Gardens in the Bayview neighborhood to develop hands-on programming utilizing food gardens at these two sites to support community wellness, resiliency, and create job opportunities. The partnership with Mercy further strengthens community linkages and incorporates gardens into Urban Sprouts community programming. Urban Sprouts is fiscally sponsored by the San Francisco Parks Alliance (Federal Tax ID: 23-7131784).","Agriculture and Farming, Community and Lifestyle, Education, Food and Beverage, Health Care, Other, Social Impact",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

We wanted our directory to be a resource for anyone who was looking to buy Made in the USA to be able to find products from clothing to cookware to pet products and everything in-between. Finding these businesses who had an actual web presence was difficult because the internet was still in its infancy and many companies were not on the internet. We chose the name BuyDirectUSA because we wanted companies to buy direct from retailers who sold Made in USA products. Back then social media didn’t exist and promotion relied solely on search results in Yahoo, Ask Jeeves, Lycos and others. We have watched the landscape of Made in USA on the internet change from only a few websites selling made in the USA to thousands of businesses who have a presence online. This has slowly started to spill over into more brick and mortar stores carrying American made products too. The surge in demand for Made in the USA products and increased support for American manufacturing is inspiring. Many American consumers are committed to the idea that buying products Made in the USA is not only beneficial for the financial health of our country, but also for the health and wellness of their families, since many products made overseas are not held to the same quality control standards required of companies that make their products in the USA. Made in USA products are more environmentally friendly than most imports simply because they are made closer to their intended customers. What started 20 years ago as a way to compile a list of websites that sold Made in the USA products has grown into a movement that is supported by American consumers, entrepreneurs and manufacturers. If you are an American manufacturer or sell products Made in the USA let us help you promote your made in the USA brand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
