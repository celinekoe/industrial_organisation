Getting music to stores around the world is easy thanks to the internet and a handful of great digital distribution companies that have developed over the last 20 years. But having music on stores around the world is useless unless local music fans know it's there, and hiring local marketing people around the world is expensive. Luckily, the music industry has long had a solution for that - revenue-sharing deals called recording licenses or sub-publishing deals. But finding partners and negotiating deals for multiple album releases across multiple countries is difficult for all but the biggest labels and publishers. That's where tuneteams comes in.  They've created an online service to make this process easier in the following ways. tuneteams provides a platform where music companies can present their releases to the international music industry. Record labels and publishers can search for available music to license by country, genre and rights type (e.g. recording, publishing, or sub-publishing). tuneteams' auction process facilitates negotiating licenses for multiple releases across multiple countries. tuneteams provides template recording license, publishing and sub-publishing contracts to make it easy for music companies of all sizes and experience levels to easily create partnerships. And tuneteams provides money transfer and escrow services so companies can feel safe that they will get paid and/or only pay if they receive the music, artwork, etc. Some people say they're ""eBay for music licensing meets LinkedIn for the music biz."" Some people call all that an online marketplace for music licensing. They call it making it easier for the international music industry to work together.","Commerce and Shopping, Community and Lifestyle, Content and Publishing, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio, Professional Services",2,"Cesar Gutierrez, Ian Henderson",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The nice part of the TapMetrics solution is that while it does a great job on the business metrics of running an iPhone application, it does just as good of a job serving the needs of the engineer.   Everything from detailed environmental data (which iPhone/Touch hardware is being used, which OS level, which release level of the application), to detailed crash reporting, to application messaging/event logs, and session tracking are supported within the integrated TapMetrics experience.   They also have a free Mac OS X app called TapMini that you can use to automatically download sales data for your iPhone applications.  If you are trying to get more out of your iPhone application portfolio (both in terms of improving the consumer experience and making more revenue), this can be a really useful tool.","Mobile, Platforms, Software",2,"Christopher Brown, Nolan Brown",11-50,1,M&A,,USD,,,USD,,LaunchBox Digital,,1,,Private,,,,,,
