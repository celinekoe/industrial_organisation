Except for the most routine cases, hunting for these insights requires grappling with complex, difficult-to-learn interfaces or tedious programming. Questions about data that take moments to formulate can take hours or much longer to answer. SkyPhrase aims to change this. With SkyPhrase, you can pose a question in simple natural language, and our artificial intelligence technology will figure out what you mean, and how to answer. Our goal is to make it easy to use all data this simply. Our web analytics and football statistics services are early steps towards achieving this goal. At SkyPhrase, our approach to natural language understanding is different because of our goals and because of our technology. We focus on giving people significantly more power over their data in specific areas, and allowing developers to easily add support to other areas. Within these areas, our technology can understand significantly more complex language with greater precision than any other technology. While we currently only cover web analytics and football statistics, our technology makes it extremely simple and easy for developers with little knowledge of linguistics or artificial intelligence to create natural language interfaces to their own data and applications. Our technology has been developed by scientists with decades of experience in artificial intelligence and computational linguistics research at institutions such as MIT, Stanford and Rensselaer. If you have a data set or API you would like to access with natural language, let us know.

You are a Learning Professional, and great in your own right, but you’re held back, slowed down, restrained because delivering the right training at the right time in your complex organization is nearly impossible. You have a vision for how it should be done, but tracking and reporting is messy, manual, or missing altogether. Support is, well, a slow ticketing system - that’s not support. And that user interface... Why can’t it be easier to use? Beautiful? Secure? integrated? Intuitive? Mobile? Why can’t your LMS support your vision? It can when you partner with Torch LMS.  Torch is different in 4 critical ways - these are the fundamentals of learning management technology, and they are our obsession:  Your Success, the user interface, user groups, and reporting. Your success is not just an outcome we hope for. We work with you from day one to create and regularly manage a long-term plan. You’ll get consistent pro-active support over years, not just the first months, so you can get every ounce of value out of our technology. We even provide migration services with our implementation consulting so we can do much of the work for you. This makes launching with Torch easier than any other LMS. All of that and a dedicated success manager come together to give you the industry’s best support.  The User interface must be beautiful, custom branded, and easy to use. Our intuitive design will wipe out user error and increase learning engagement. A Torch LMS client recently surveyed their 25,000 users, asking them to independently grade the Torch LMS user experience. In each of the company’s grading categories, their users scored Torch far above the industry benchmark. We scored significantly higher than the “top-tier” LMS that they used before switching to Torch.    User-group management is the heart and soul of automation and reporting, and Torch does this in a uniquely powerful way. User groups can be used to assign training, give access to content, control branding experiences, filter in reports, send communications, display announcements, control admin permissions, and more. Our user-group functionality provides so much flexibility in automation that even the most complex organization will seem simple to manage. Reporting in Torch LMS will simplify and empower your work life. No more manual spreadsheets. Easily make reports as detailed as you want them, including analyzing scorm and custom field data, and schedule regular automated report delivery to any combination of individuals and user groups. You’ll be able to measure impact and share insights like never before. This description only scratches the surface of Torch’s unique functionality.
