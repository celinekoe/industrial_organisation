Operating out of a small, single bay warehouse and showroom in Alexandria, Virginia, they were established as a full line imported car parts outlet for a much larger importer of German car parts. They sold and delivered parts to professional repair facilities, service stations and chains as well as the “do it yourself” walk-in customers. With seven employees and three delivery vehicles, even in the formative, early years, their focus was on providing professional and DIY mechanics the highest quality import parts available, pricing it right and getting it there fast!. In the fall of 1986, Michael Brown, then store manager, purchased the assets of Olympic Imported Parts Corp. of Virginia from the original owner, Karl Flicker. It was a scary time. The receivables of the company were about the same as the newly acquired debt service, so it was vital to keep overhead low and just go crazy growing the sales of the company. In those early days, everyone was responsible for everything: salesmen sold parts, posted inventory, pulled their own orders, and usually stayed until late at night restocking their inventory. They believed that whether they succeeded or not, no one was going to outwork us. Through the 1980s & 90’s, the import car market was growing at an exceptional rate and so was their company. Sales were increasing, their delivery fleet was expanding, as was the work required to keep up with their growth. Additional warehouse space was soon needed to house their ever-expanding inventory. What began as a small business with a handful of employees gradually became a fast growing, thriving enterprise. In fact, the Washington Business Journal in 1995 presented us with their “Fast Track” award for being among the fastest growing businesses in the Washington, D.C. area in the category of distribution. After 27 years, it was time get a fresh new look for their company and in 2004, they dressed up their company vehicles with their new “energy-laced” logo and changed their name from Olympic to Olympus Imported Auto Parts. It is not possible to travel the roads of the D.C. area without seeing their flashy and friendly Olympus Scion XB’s.",Transportation,1,Karl Flicker,51-100,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Each project has a specific funding goal and a deadline. Working alongside partners and collaborators, the site uses social media to guide micro-donors to each project to pledge as little as $1 (the default amount) to help that project get off the ground. While there is no limit to what donors can give, the model is to raise significant financial and social capital for these ventures by spreading world-changing ideas and examples through ever-widening networks of individual donors who each contribute relatively small donations.  Tipping Bucket's commitment to its donors is to ""change the world or your money back."" If the funding goal isn't met by the specific deadline, none of the transactions are processed and the next project gets its turn in the bucket.
