The purpose of creating CSI was to market an innovative product **Strategic Network System** which is capable of simulating flow of information in a group of persons.  This product was tested by a Wall street brokerage firm to evaluate the value of ""Word of Mouth"" marketing strategy. This was much before the days of myspace or facebook. The result was interesting and was presented at the SUGI 18 (SAS User Group International) conference in New York in 1993. The market was not ready for such technology at that time. In 1992, _CSI_ conducted Fair Market Rent (FMR) studies for the City of Tucson Housing Authority. The officials of Tucson did not accept the Tucson FMR data provided by Housing and Urban Development (HUD), which was responsible for administering Section-8 Housing Assistance program in USA. City of Tucson contracted with CSI Consulting service to collect renters data in accordance with the HUD FMR Guidelines for List Assisted Random Digit Dialing (RDD) methodology. CSI's report proved that HUD's FMR was inaccurate for Tucson MSA. Therefore, City was given additional funding to meet the rental needs. By end of 1994, CSI became the market leader in providing FMR studies in USA. CSI conducted 10,000+ calls for each project by utilizing Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) system.  In addition to FMR projects, CSI conducted Seat Belt Use studies for Arizona, New Mexico, North Dakota and Maine.

Flexaya,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/flexaya,"Biotechnology, Fitness, Health Care","San Francisco, California, United States",Muscle mass diagnostics as a subscription service,"2,273,373","San Francisco Bay Area, West Coast, Western US",,Closed,2017-06-01,day,,,,none,For Profit,http://flexaya.com,"As humans, our muscle mass is a primary indicator of our longevity, both as we develop early in life, as well as seek to maintain muscle mass throughout our adult and senior years. Current diagnostics only measure a more generalized lean mass or body fat, neither of which true indicators of strength and health, especially in the body compositions of young children. Yet, there does not exist an accurate way to measure direct skeletal muscle mass in any capacity. Flexaya is the first-to-market in offering a commercially available diagnostic to directly measure muscle mass. Using unique features of muscle tissue and creatine biology, Flexaya provides a simple, affordable approach to measure muscle mass, one that can be repeated at home through a subscription-based service model, all without the need for access to specialized equipment. We have validated this measure against the gold standard (MRI) with greater than 98% accuracy rate in both adults and children (see Clark J Appl Physiol 1985). At our respective academic institutions, we have implemented in this measure in a large, $1.5m NIH-funded study of more than 1400 older men, as well as in a large study of more than 100 infants and children with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The extensions of Flexaya’s testing method are vast, as studies underway indicate that muscle mass is perhaps the most sensitive metric to track growth stunting due to malnutrition, a global epidemic affecting nearly one-in-four children worldwide. As skeletal muscle is the largest organ in the body for glucose disposal, our measure may also have applications in diabetic research.  Flexaya’s method may well evolve as the standard diagnostic in what is an increasing appetite for self-diagnostic health and fitness data by the mass-market adult consumer, as well as become the defacto test for pediatricians and neonatologists to determine the trajectory of growth of infants and children.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering, Sports",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
