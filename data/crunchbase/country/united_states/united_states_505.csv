From the initial product idea to supply chain management, Gecko appreciates each client's unique needs. Every project, small or large, local or global, is approached with an unparalleled level of personalization.  Founded in 1996 by Jacques Gagne, Gecko's direct approach to design has quickly become sought out by such reputable companies as Dell, Hewlett Packard, and Herman Miller.

But creativity without practicality is useless in consumer product development. At Gecko, designers understand the limitations of manufacturing and can intercept potentially costly design glitches early on. The language of design and manufacturing are often divergent. Our ability to converge the two by balancing an industrial designer's organic shape with manufacturing realities allows geckos to create quality products while remaining true to the original design.",Design,,,1-10,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Mr. Lindsay left True Temper in the spring of 1999 to form Vyatek Sports in May of the same year. He was able to acquire the entire Simula/ViaTech asset portfolio, all intellectual property (patents, trade-secrets, designs, trademarks and brands), tooling, equipment, and inventory relating to ViaTech's consumer product initiatives. Vyatek Sports, Inc was formed to continue the vision that began in 1993 and to facilitate the Simula/ViaTech acquisition. The acquired technologies involve advanced composite materials, processing science and energy management techniques that have significant application in the design and manufacture of high-performance sporting goods.

When Adam Lancaster, VP of technology sales for Cold Creek, heard that CSS was planning a storage refresh, he urged the company to consider solutions outside of the EMC box – namely, the unified storage family from Hitachi Data Systems (HDS). With configuration expertise provided by the local HDS team and logistical and financial support from Arrow ECS, Cold Creek was able to propose a best-of-both-worlds solution that leveraged a Hitachi Unified Storage (HUS) front end for virtualization and utilized CSS’s existing EMC storage resources on the back end. The solution also came in at about one half the cost of the proposed Symmetrix VMAX solution from EMC. “The pricing ended up being what they needed, but Hitachi really stood apart from a technology perspective,” says Warwick. “Number one, the HUS would allow us to virtualize and extend the usability of their EMC assets that weren’t ready for end of life. Second, it would be quickly and easily scalable with flash drives that slot right into the normal chassis. And finally, it was developed with an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) architecture, so they knew it was purpose-built for meeting enterprise storage demands.”","Consumer Electronics, Data and Analytics, Hardware, Information Technology, Software",1,Paul Schwappach,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The TruMedicines Pill Recognizer can be used as a software service (SAAS) for mobile applications, to identify pills that have been registered in our database.

Able to to identify billions of individual drug tablets using an android smartphone app now available on Amazon Apps https://goo.gl/m4WAhC Big Data Analytics for Big Pharma TruMedicines has patented a technology which allows a smartphone app to identify random patterns on drug pills. When a user scans a drug package barcode or pill, our 2 step, cloud based image recognition webservice performs image recognition matching to our image database on that drug tablet and provides text and audible information to the user-  What, when, where, expiration date, adverse reaction rate, adverse multi-drug reaction rate, customized messages from Drug Distributor. All data is in compliance with the 2013 Drug Security Act. (requires full track/trace compliance for all drugs sold in USA by 2017).   The Problems 1) Counterfeit Drugs  - National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) found in 2010 that 97 percent of the more than 10,900 Internet pharmacies were selling counterfeit drugs. The World Health Organization reports counterfeit drugs cause 1Mil deaths/year in developing countries, India, Africa, and Asia. In the United States a rising occurrence of 100,000 deaths/year are caused by adverse drug reactions, drug mistakes and overdoses. Peter Pitts, president of The Center for Medicine in the Public Interest and former FDA associate commissioner, estimates that in 2010, activities related to counterfeit drugs generated $75 billion, based on information obtained from government organizations. He expects it to grow by 20 percent annually in the coming years. If this estimate is correct, the counterfeit drug industry generates nearly as much cash as the world's fourth-largest wholesale drug company by revenue, AmerisourceBergen, which generated  $79 billion in 2012. 2) Non-compliance to drug therapy (USA) - The annual costs of chronic conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, are estimated to be $174 billion and $403 billion, respectively, in the United States. As these chronic disease costs continue to rise, managed care stakeholders and health insurance companies are continually looking for areas in which the quality of care can be improved and expenditures reduced. One such area is medication compliance, where increased compliance rates have demonstrated improved clinical outcomes and reduced overall medical expenditures.Source JMPC Jul 2008 vol 8 •	up to 90% of diabetes patients do not take their medication well enough to benefit from that medication. •	33-50% of some cancer patients take less of their anti-cancer medicine than required. •	only 75% of coronary heart disease (CHD) patients take sufficient medicine for it to be effective. •	Up to 75% of hypertensive patients do not adhere to their medicine. •	41-59% of mentally ill patients take their medication infrequently or not at all. •	33% of patients with schizophrenia don’t take their medicine at all, and 33% are poorly adherent. •	Less than 27% depressed patients adhere to their medication. The Solution TruMedicines has transformed drug tablets into data source points, which can be used for individual health improvement and collectively as a public health data source. TruMedicines is a “game changer” for how medicine is administered and how customers interact with medicine.
