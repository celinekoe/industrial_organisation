How it works: Founders enter tasks and expenses into Accumi. The equity split updates in real time as tasks are closed or expenses incurred.  Benefits: Accumi bases the equity split on data instead of gut feel guesses or negotiating skills. It is a fair way to split equity.

In May of 2014 I found out that I am one of millions of Americans with Type 2 diabetes I decided to take action and get treatment, but was frustrated at how difficult it was to find a doctor online!    With recent changes in healthcare, I realized that millions of people across the nation are struggling just like me, and I decided to do something to help fix the problem!     After months of planning, my team and I finally created MyDoctor.Care.     Our goal is to make it super quick and easy for anyone in the US to find the right doctor, anytime they need one, no matter where they live!  Best of all, our service is always free for patients, and all registered users are able to WIN all sorts of prizes at our periodic prize drawings just for using our website!

In fact, recent surveys suggest that nearly half of active doctors are considering shutting down their practices within the next several years!     Can You Imagine How Much Of A Nightmare It Would Be To Find A Doctor If Half Of The Offices Open Today Were No Longer Operating In 5 Years?    We make it easy and affordable for doctors to attract more new patients, so they can spend their time and resources running their practice and helping those in need.. instead of worrying about marketing their business!    Unlike competing companies, we offer physicians a guaranteed placement at the top of our search results & a monthly flow of patients. We are launching dynamic digital and local marketing campaigns, including celebrity sponsorships and prize giveaways to help us accelerate our growth and attract thousands of patients across the US.
