Our president, Nolan Hutwelker, is currently a data analyst at EarthRes Engineering, where he assists safety supervisors and production foremen in managing environmental, health and safety risks on-site, throughout the Appalachian region. Our vice president, Russell Short, is a native West Virginian who has seen the effect of poor training in these high risk industries and the impact it leaves on the community and state as a whole. He is proficient in multiple programming languages and has a passion for graphics and interactive software.   We came across the following over and over and over. Current safety training was ineffective and the people that needed it the most just didn't do it. The current training methods just didn't work. And to top it off, this was REALLY important safety training. The kind that keeps a person alive in high risk scenarios. And sadly, people die because of this. All the time.   Why train people if your training is not fully effective? How can we improve current training methods?   Our solution to these issues is to use Virtual Reality (VR) to develop customized training programs that people will be excited for, something that makes people use their bodies, voice, and brain. Studies show that this will cut their learning curve in half. So no longer will training be in a classroom, pamphlet, or on a high risk job site. ​ Everyone fears headlines like these:   “Man dies on well site, apparently from H2S: 20-year-old found dead over open cover of crude tank” “One by one, 3 utility workers descended into a manhole. One by one, they died.” “3 workers die in underground pipeline”   You can be the reason 3 people go home safe to their families! You can be the reason why a child won’t go fatherless due to a safety disaster! You can be the reason the industry has a cultural shift!    Working with us will help improve safety training and will help eliminate these headlines. If you help us today YOU can be a part of a brand new wave of safety training. Gone are the days of sitting in front of a computer going through a mundane and outdated training program.","Education, Hardware, Software",1,Nolan Hutwelker,1-10,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

We specialize in providing one source manufacturers of generic seizure medications to patients who suffer from Epilepsy. Retail and mail order pharmacies will often stock the lowest cost generic product in order to maximize their revenue. This is a concern because they may switch manufacturer’s products at any given time to take advantage of pricing opportunities. These manufacturers’ products effectiveness can vary from 80% to 125% above the branded drugs established bioequivalence. This means that taking one generic manufacturer’s product one month and switching to another the next month can result in a 50% or greater difference in a patient’s blood levels. Patients risk more side effects or insufficient efficacy and they run the risk of breakthrough seizures. This risk is too high to ignore for patients and their Doctors. Nuropharma, Inc. guarantees the consistency of their generic seizure product from month to month. We will not change our manufacturer to take advantage of improving our profits to the detriment of patients with Epilepsy. On the occasion a manufacturer discontinues making a product we will notify you and your physician promptly. We will provide a new manufacturer product and compare their product, via dissolution studies, to the discontinued product to ensure that it has the smallest possible deviation from the patients past medication. We will also notify you and your Physician of any changes being made with your medications. This will minimize the risk of breakthrough seizures due to fluctuating blood levels.

Here is a quick video explaining: https://vimeo.com/64239747 As a Vendor there are a few major benefits and points I'd like to emphasize; - ValPark cost vendors nothing to accept. We do not take anything from the Vendors principle. We simply pass on a small convenience fee (<$2) to end user. - ValPark cuts down on attendant theft. Now vendors can help eliminate cash passing through the hands of unattended employees. Theft will drastically be cut and revenue will increase. - It's easy to use and train employees. Our Vendor side component app, Exec, is very easy to learn and train across the board. Employees can learn it within 10-15mins completely. - Users only see ValPark locations. Users use our app to also find local parking. When viewing our map of valet/garage parking locations we only show locations accepting ValPark. You can now access our pre-existing user-base. How does this benefit your Customers? - No need to go to an ATM. The reason your customers use Valet or Garage parking is for the convenience. When you ask them to make a run to an ATM the convenience is lost. Users can now pay for Parking via the ValPark app without even pulling out their phone via our bluetooth technologies. - Safety. Users feel safer using ValPark in comparison to cash. It's less hassle and risk. Getting Started To get started with ValPark we will walk you through the 20-minute sign-up process personally and explain to you what you'll need to run efficiently. We will help to establish training for your staff and quality control. It's very easy and simple to use.
