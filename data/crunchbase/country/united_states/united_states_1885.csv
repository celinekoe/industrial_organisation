We serve the state by educating its citizens, enhancing the culture, and making a difference in people’s lives through research and service. U.S. News & World Report ranks UT fiftieth among all public universities in the nation. By attracting the best and brightest students and leading faculty, we’re on track to join our peers in the nation’s Top 25. An aggressive roadmap guides our journey. We’re improving undergraduate and graduate education, research, support for faculty and staff, our campus infrastructure, and our resources. With more than 27,000 students and 10,000 faculty and staff, we power the state’s economy and fuel innovations that yield ideas and solutions that improve people’s lives and our society. Our faculty are renowned scholars in their disciplines and committed teachers who serve through the university’s nine undergraduate colleges and eleven graduate and professional programs.  With more than 300 degree programs, we prepare and empower leaders in just about every profession. Our engineering, business, education, law, and social work programs consistently rank among the Top 50 in the nation among public universities, at the undergraduate or graduate level. UT is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award baccalaureate, master’s, and doctoral degrees. Consistently cited as a “best buy” and great value, we’re committed to access and affordability. A wide range of scholarships help to open doors for many qualified students to become Volunteers. The number of students who study abroad has soared during recent years with the rise in new scholarships, internships, and service learning opportunities around the world. We are committed to ensuring our campus is a welcoming environment where people are open to learning from one another. We celebrate our differences and the opportunities they create through experiences with people who have different beliefs and come from other places, cultures, and backgrounds. Diversity means more to our campus community than race and ethnicity; it’s about moving beyond just tolerance to a place of understanding about political views, religion, gender identity, values, age, abilities, and sexual orientation, among other differences.  We are proud of our students and committed to their success by providing comprehensive academic support and programs that engage them in campus life. Each new freshman class demonstrates our ever-increasing academic quality. A quick drive through our 560-acre campus illustrates our momentum in enhancing our academic and student life facilities. We opened the $40 million Natalie L. Haslam Music Center, home of the university’s School of Music, the $23.2 million John D. Tickle Engineering Building, which houses the departments of civil and environmental engineering and industrial and systems engineering, and the Fred D. Brown Residence Hall. Work also continues on the new student union, the largest single project in the university’s history. Thirteen new sorority houses, adjacent to campus, are part of the Sorority Village development on Morgan Hill. Our campus master plan guides our vision, which includes a more pedestrian-friendly campus with more green space and the addition of significant classroom and laboratory space in the next decade. Our undergraduate and graduate students have unprecedented opportunities for hands-on work and research through our partnership with Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The Bredesen Center for Interdisciplinary Research provides opportunities for graduate students in energy-related science and engineering and puts the university front and center in training the country’s scientists to take on the world’s most challenging energy problems. The partnerships enhance the state’s role as a growing hub for research in critical challenges that include alternative energy, national security, and the creation of new materials.

Our 1st in class gene therapy (ET-101) has been engineered to overexpress Caveolin-1, which organizes & regulates synaptic receptors essential for neuromuscular signaling and function. It can treat a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases through precise, targeted overexpression of Caveolin-1 in neurons . We are also advancing a new generation of tissue factor (TF) therapies (ET-201) – therapeutics designed to target the cell surface receptor now known to be prevalent on solid tumor cells, tumor vasculature, and tumor stem cells, but absent on normal cells. By targeting these proteins which play a central role in the pathology of inflammation and angiogenesis, we can stop tumor growth, spread, and recurrence. Our first indications are neurodegenerative diseases and cancers with high unmet need and high mortality (e.g. ALS and triple negative breast cancer).

The shift to cloud-native applications and easily accessible cloud platforms means that developers have much more freedom to go from idea to running application. The silos across development and infrastructure have been torn down. As developers, we can now develop, build, test, deploy, and monitor our own services. Yet there are a lot of moving parts in this new cloud-native world – more discrete pieces of software like microservices and functions. There are many phases of the development and delivery flow – code review, build, unit test, containerize, integration test, binary artifacts, container cluster managers, manual and scripted release steps, health checks, and performance monitoring. We believe that developers should have tools to take care of the individual stages of that flow, and very importantly, a way to integrate, streamline, and automate the overall flow from code to ship. We started Atomist to build that platform for developers. We have deep roots in open source and serving developers at SpringSource, Pivotal/VMware, GitHub and Oracle. Our core technologies are rooted in deeply understanding the code, people, and flow. We started tackling the problem with project creation, core updates like dependencies, status notifications, and the release process because these steal big chunks of time each and every day.

Easter Seals currently serves hundreds of children every summer in our camping program at Agassiz Village in Maine.  Through the Youth Leadership program, Easter Seals also offers opportunities for young people with disabilities to discover their personal abilities and skills. Service learning activities help generate feelings of importance and self-worth, while encouraging them to become forces for change in their communities.  In 1988, Easter Seals recognized the potential benefits that technology holds for children and adults with disabilities. Its assistive technology program began with a few donated computers and one specialist. Today, the program has more than 20 specialists and utilizes a wide array of software, hardware and adaptive devices.  Easter Seals is now a national leader in using technology to expand independence for people with disabilities at home, in school and in the workplace.  Numerous programs help people access the assistive technology they need. At the Assistive Technology Regional Centers, people with disabilities can see, try out and borrow devices in order to make more informed decisions about technology that will meet their needs.  The Massachusetts Assistive Technology Loan Program provides access to low-interest cash loans for the purchase of assistive devices and services that will improve the quality of life for people with disabilities. Our Long-Term Device Loan Program provides people with assistive devices that cost less than $500. The devices are available free of charge to qualified Massachusetts residents with disabilities and their families.  Easter Seals Rehabilitation Services offers physical, occupational and speech therapy to people in homes, schools, nursing homes, day care centers and clinics.  The Easter Seals Job Training and Employment program helps people with disabilities develop the skills they need in order to get and keep jobs in today’s competitive workplace. The program offers individualized vocational rehabilitation, job training and employment services to students and adults.  Easter Seals staff members also answer thousands of questions every year through a disability resource information center. And advocates work to help state legislators and government officials understand and meet all the needs of men, women and children with disabilities.  In 2014, Easter Seals services benefited more than 26,000 Massachusetts residents with disabilities, their families, teachers and employers.  Easter Seals and its affiliate organizations are 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations.","Community and Lifestyle, Health Care, Other, Social Impact",1,Edgar Allen,501-1000,5,,,,,2580000,USD,2580000,"Abbott, Comcast NBCUniversal, Comcast NBCUniversal Foundation, Comcast Foundation",3,4,1,Private,,,,,,

The FORTE approach was invented by Dr Nat Ware as part of his Oxford PhD on a Rhodes Scholarship. With the FORTE approach, the cost of high-quality education (such as retraining) and healthcare (such as cataract eye surgery) is paid for by investors. Individuals who receive these services pay nothing - either now or in the future. Instead, investors receive a portion of any increase in future taxation revenue caused by those services. Think of it as ""Future Lydia's taxes paying for Present Lydia's training"". In a nutshell, it works in three steps: 1. Via Forte, investors can pay for the services of individuals who would otherwise be paying no or negligible tax. 2. These services (such as vocational retraining), by their nature, increase expected employment, incomes, and therefore government income tax revenue. 3. Governments, as part of the contractual arrangement, pass back to investors (via Forte) an agreed portion of the tax revenue attributable to the training recipients, for a set period of time. This arrangement is mutually beneficial.  Individuals receive training at no cost and with no risk. They just pay the usual tax rate. They’re effectively paying for their own training with their future tax. Governments pay nothing upfront. They can increase the skilled modern workforce, overcome skill gaps, and help those in need, without worsening the budget. Importantly, there are easy mathematical ways of structuring the contract so they only pass on in the future what they otherwise would not have had. In other words, the FORTE model pays for itself in a guaranteed way. Investors get low-risk, short-term returns. They can do well while doing good. There is perfect alignment of social impact and financial returns.
