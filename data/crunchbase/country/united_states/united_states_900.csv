As a national indicator of the health of the U.S. economy and a tool for gauging the competitiveness of individual firms and predicting future profitability, it supports business, researchers, policymakers, and consumers of the U.S. It surveys roughly 70,000 customers each year to collect information with regards to the products and services that they use the most. Information collected through these surveys is used as inputs to an econometric model that scales customer satisfaction with more than 230 companies in 43 industries and 10 economic sectors, as well as over 100 services, programs, and websites of federal government agencies. American Customer Satisfaction Index’s time-tested, scientific model delivers key insights across the complete customer experience. Its results are related to some essential indicators of micro and macroeconomic performance. At the micro level, companies that display high levels of customer satisfaction tend to have higher earnings and stock returns relative to competitors. At the macro level, customer satisfaction has been shown to be predictive of both consumer spending and gross domestic product growth. Starting in May 2010, American Customer Satisfaction Index data became available to the public on a more regular basis, with results released multiple times per year. This change allows stakeholders to focus more in-depth on different sections of the economy over the entire calendar year.  American Customer Satisfaction Index was founded in the United States in 1994 by researchers at the [University of Michigan](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/the-university-of-michigan-2), along with the American Society for Quality in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and CFI Group in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

We at hyaqu want to revolutionize ecommerce. HYAQU is currently in stealth-mode development in Stanford, CA. A team of 3 developers are working on designing the software around the Pyramid (Pylons Project) Framework. I came up with the idea for HYAQU in December 2010 and mentioned my idea to some friends, knowing I would never have a chance to create it. And one of them actually said ""yes we should do that"". Three months later I finally started believing that she was serious, so we talked about a number of options. One of my passions was Old Fashioned Drug Stores, and I had been managing one in Carmel, CA for about 6 years and worked their for about 10 years so I figured it was time I start my own. So we moved up to Portland to start Teddy's Drug Store, but quickly realized that Portland & Oregon aren't as local as they claim to be. We scrapped the drug store and agreed that the drug store probably would have cost us $1.5 million to create from scratch, but I could probably find some developers to make the ecommerce store I had been talking about in December. I said hell yeah. I stalled for about a month trying to find a development team in Oregon to build my project, but I'm not a developer so it was really tough for me to try to interview people when I really didn't know what skillsets they needed to accomplish our goals. I called up a friend who works in CS at Stanford and told him about my project. He said he would look for some people there. A few days later he had a dream team. And now we're busy coding away.

As an ad-tech marketing firm, Intraxio has designed and developed a way to drastically increase e-commerce profitability and customer satisfaction. It features a proprietary method of product advertising, and Intraxio’s new technology promises to increase online retail profitability by approximately 365%. And it already has. Intraxio has used its expertise to e-retail $1.9M in tech merchandise by approaching marketing in a practical manner: informing customers exactly where the item can be used. How does it work? Intraxio simply incorporates traditional advertisements with data analytics about product-use trends. For example, a “hard drive” is sold as a “Dell Latitude D610 hard drive,” and so-on. The resulting ADs boost sales conversions by being more relevant to customers, and they reduce product returns by guiding product usability. Intraxio calls this marketing invention PUMA, short for Product-Use Marketing Analytics. Surprisingly, pay-per-click advertising with PUMA is a lot less expensive than traditional marketing. Within one market segment, for example, average cost of comparable PPC AdWords (Google) is about ½ that of standard AD keywords. Additionally, the available daily click volume is up to 10X higher. And online customers arrive in droves to buy PUMA-backed products because their inherent relevance saves them time. Before a 2011 change in eBay listing policy resulted in an operational shutdown, Intraxio had sold over 70,000 product orders—40,000 of which were backed by the PUMA technology. Seeking to exit the e-retail space, Intraxio is now pursuing a venture capital infusion of $1.4M to re-tool its processes and enter the broader e-commerce market as an online marketing-only service. The company intends to generate hi-profit and hi-volume product orders before delivering them to 3rd-party vendors at a small premium. The service, which does not compete with traditional marketing, will reduce ad-spend risk for vendors like NewEgg.com, supplement their sales, and raise their net profitability (currently 8%)—even after Intraxio takes its commission. Intraxio estimates that industry-wide net profitability can reach as high as 20% using an advertising methodology like PUMA. Through its US patent-pending process, Intraxio will undoubtedly disrupt the way online shopping is conducted. E-commerce, a $1T market growing at 20% per year, is ripe for innovation. Advertising for product lines like computer hardware, cell-phone accessories, and interchangeable parts will never be the same again. Expect to see Intraxio at the leading edge of a new online marketplace.","Advertising, Commerce and Shopping, Data and Analytics, Sales and Marketing",1,Nick Naso,1-10,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
