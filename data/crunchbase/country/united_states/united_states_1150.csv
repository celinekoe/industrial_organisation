As such, Black and Fowler made the decision to establish a nonprofit organization to handle conference arrangements. Thus, Ruby Central was born. Ruby Central’s first conference was RubyConf 2002 in Seattle, and since then, annual RubyConfs have been held every fall. In 2006, Ruby Central added a dimension to the world of Ruby conferences when they produced the first official Ruby on Rails Conference, better known as RailsConf.

Sixjax offers members six different styles of auctions, plus achievements and game modifiers. And youâ€:tm:ll get almost 50% more Tokens for the dollar than other sites. Sixjax's standard auction is the most common auction on the site. Users with regular Tokens, and each bid will increase the price by one cent. The winner is the last person to bid with no counterbid. Specialty auctions operate in the same manner as the Standard but with more sophistication. They only happen with our most unique and valuable items, like backstage passes, sporting tickets and vacation packages. Last Man Standing is a totally different kind of auction experience. Itâ€:tm:s all in the timing. Members are shown the price of a regular Standard Auction, but whoever wins will pay only 1% of the Normal Auction price, a huge discount on the ending auction price. The last person to bid when the timer strikes zero wins this endurance themed auction. In an Upper Hand auction, strategy is key and things are never what they seem. Bidders have special Modifiers that can be used (though not required in order to bid) against specific players or against all the users in the auction. For example, they can be used to â€œfreezeâ€ another bidder, preventing them from bidding for 30 seconds. Or, they can â€œscrambleâ€ the clock. There are a bunch of special moves, meaning these auctions can be dirty, mischievous, but really fun. For more information on Modifiers, please refer to the Modifier (link) FAQ. Hybrid Auctions are a cross between Specialty and Last Man Standing Auctionsâ€:tm: awesome, unique items and an Upper Hand Auctionâ€:tm:s strategic special plays. It combines the best elements of all our auctions with unique items, special moves and more. VIP auctions are only available to our biggest bidders. Theyâ€:tm:re similar to Standard auctions but are only accessible to an exclusive list of invitees.",Commerce and Shopping,2,"Alex Bernon, Andrew Gallina",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Alan, a former Honeywell Executive responsible for Signal and Image Processing Business Development, founded and grew Machine Dreams into one of the world's largest knowledge visualization companies. His clients spanned the globe and all industry segments. Alan was acclaimed for the inventive creativity of the unique software, hardware and services Machine Dreams provided to most of the world's largest corporations.  Since then, Alan assembled a team that has spent the last 10 years developing WAY to solve the largest problem facing the world today, and fully embrace the greatest business opportunity of the century - the reinvention of the defective primitive language and interfaces we use for everything important. Fast Company judged WAY to be one of the top world changing ideas of 2019. Noted media experts and social networking companies believe what WAY has developed will inevitably disrupt and replace the way human beings communicate with themselves and their computer screens. What WAY has invented (5 seminal patents and more pending) is an elegantly simple multi sensory universal language that for the first time enables organizations and individuals to accumulate, access and apply a systemic lens to everything complex - with an attractive entertaining gaming-like interface,, paint by numbers touch, no language barriers, feedback loops for mass action reward and recognition, transparency and proof verification on top of AI and Big Data, and ubiquitous potential.  WAY's new pattern based semiotic language will disrupt and revolutionize commerce, the internet, social networks, finance, healthcare, organizational management systems, AI/Big Data/IT, education and economic systems worldwide. WAY's invention is an entirely new paradigm that declares that our inherited deficient languages - how people think, communicate and act - are actually THE problem. The solution is an accumulative multi-sensory language built upon ontologically organized universal cellular models filled with pattern and sound to signify meaning. Please contact us to experience what many believe is the invention that will reset how corporations and economies work. WAY is seeking a corporate partner to fully realize its technology and bring its inventions to life or investors who believe in WAY's new paradigm.","Education, Health Care, Information Technology, Internet Services, Software",1,Alan Yelsey,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,Bossanova Investimentos,,1,,Private,,,,,,
