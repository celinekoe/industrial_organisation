From Backup Camera Systems, to entertainment electronics, to simple LED novelty items (some of which were invented by Tadibrothers), we are dedicated to selling items that we ourselves tested and use in our day to day lives.  We were the first to offer videos that help illuminate exactly what you are buying to help you make the most informed decision. We have also made it a priority to offer all our customers a wide range of items and we would never sell an item that doesn’t fit our high quality standard. Our flexible and easy return policy reflects that. As does our exchange policy. For example if you buy a 7"" monitor from us and then realize you would rather have a 9"" no problem! Call us and we will exchange it out for you, we will make sure you have the system that works perfect for you.   While creating Tadibrothers.com we learned that many websites don’t actually have the items they sell and just drop ship, this holds them to a lower level of responsibility. Some are even overseas and do not have the customer service support system we offer. At Tadibrothers we house and ship every item directly from our warehouses, we don’t drop ship from other suppliers.  This means that on the rare occasion something goes wrong it’s our duty to correct the problem to the customers’ satisfaction. If you have a problem, you can simply call us, our phone numbers are displayed on every page of the site. We are here to help. We strive to make buying online the best and easiest experience possible.","Commerce and Shopping, Consumer Electronics, Hardware",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
