This price includes fuel, so the customer does not need to pay extra for fuel. Our boats are located in the city of Grant-Valkaria, Florida, right on the Indian River Lagoon at the Indian River Marina. The basic concept of how our business is run daily is a customer will either go on our website and reserve a boat or they will call us by phone and reserve a boat. Currently, we have three boats so they can either rent 1,2, or 3 boats if they are available. From there, the customer will receive an email with a waiver to fill out, along with location directions and helpful instructions. On the day of their rental, they will arrive at the Indian River Marina, along with the rest of their group, where they will be met by one of our staff. Our staff will help them and their group get loaded onto the boat, checked in, and give a safety briefing/instructional overview. The customer will then take the boat until their reservation time is over, in which they will return the boat to the same place they departed from. Our staff will help them get docked safely and unloaded.","Sports, Travel and Tourism",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Real Estate is a $50 Billion a year industry and 90% of those clients, both sellers and buyers, start their real estate search online. Elite Agent Realty knows the office building has become obsolete. Our virtual business model not only makes sense in today’s internet driven marketplace but also let’s us expand 10x faster than our competition at a fraction of the cost.     This also gives us the ability to target markets that ensure profits for the company and most importantly our shareholders. We look for markets with a minimum 5000 homes sold a year and an average sales price of $600,000 or more. Our goal is to service 5% of any particular market place within 3 years and 15% within 10. With a gross brokerage take home of 1.25% of each home's sales price and a 60% profit margin that’s a minimum $1,125,000 annual profit per team at year three.     Over the past year we have been researching and speaking with some of the most successful agents across the country to developed our new marketing strategy. We limited our initial proof of concept to two weeks. Our focus was on The Tri-Valley area of the East Bay with annual home's sales of 5200 and an average sales price of $918,000. We only touched 25% of the online market and received 81 leads at an average cost of $40.99 per lead. Of those leads we are working 4 Listings and 5 buyers totaling $7.7 Million in sales volume, or $96,250 in Gross Commission Income. Our goal is a 5% conversion rate, but it’s too early in our implementation to get true conversion numbers just yet. That being said even if we get one out of those 81 leads into contract, we are looking at a 222% ROI.","Commerce and Shopping, Real Estate, Sales and Marketing",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
