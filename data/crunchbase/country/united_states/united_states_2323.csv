The result is an IT end user idea exchange free of vendors, resellers & conflicted interest research firms.  Since 2009, Enterprise Technology Research (ETR) has been organically growing an end user member base that could accurately represent and therefore, accurately predict IT spending trends. The sample now exceeds 3,000 members globally. This sample mimics the S&P 500’s industry composite, but also includes members from the government, nonprofit and education sectors.  Furthermore, the sample is ~70% large enterprise and 65% North American based. ETR has now conducted 14 spending intention surveys in a standardized format methodology and has accurately forecast numerous occurrences of significant growth by formerly unknown technology vendors, as well as the demise of many other vendors that were once thought invincible.  It is our belief that our forward-looking data and analytics model can dramatically aid enterprise IT end users and CIOs to identify which of their vendors are most at-risk and therefore, most prone to price leveraging. In the ever-evolving enterprise technology landscape, ETR can also highlight vendors that deserve to be evaluated immediately.  Our surveys routinely capture a sample size of over 150 people within 24 hours and we routinely close surveys after 4-5 weeks with samples of over 400. This goes to prove our ability to gain valuable data in near real-time. As soon as members submit their questionnaires, they are provided with live and secure links to the real-time polling data so that they may track the data and results.

The story of BraunAbility begins with founder, Ralph Braun. Diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy and unable to walk by the age of 15, he was determined to find a better way to stay mobile than being pushed in a manual chair and carried in and out of vehicles.  Ralph started by inventing the world’s first electric scooter, which he called the Tri-Wheeler. From there Ralph designed the world’s first wheelchair lift and steering controls, allowing Ralph to drive himself independently for the first time in his life.  Ralph quickly discovered that others just like him were hungry for that same independence. With just a handful of employees and despite overwhelming odds, Ralph started his business, and a new industry emerged.  Over the past four decades, BraunAbility products have revolutionized what independence means to wheelchair users. Today BraunAbility has over 1000 employees, all working to grow mobility across the world. Ralph Braun passed away in 2013, but his legacy is still the driving force behind the BraunAbility mission today.  As the world leader in mobility with over 40 years of experience, BraunAbility understands what you're looking for in wheelchair vans, wheelchair lifts and mobility products. Why? Because BraunAbility was founded by a man who needed that mobility for himself. Ralph Braun built his company on a commitment to quality, safety, and innovation. Ralph also believed in giving his customers the peace of mind that wherever their travels take them, there's an experienced mobility professional close by. Put your trust in the BraunAbility name and their nationwide dealer network. They're committed to get you where you want to go — today and tomorrow.","Manufacturing, Professional Services, Transportation",1,Ralph Braun,1001-5000,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,1,Private,,,,,,

These catheters are now known around the world as the Millar® Mikro-Tip® Pressure Transducer Catheters. Millar continues to be committed to providing both clinicians and researchers with the most exacting tools available for obtaining these specific physiological signals. The company was founded forty years ago by Huntly Millar who remained deeply involved in research and development throughout his lifetime. Shortly after their products were initially introduced, they had become known as the gold standard in vivo pressure measurements. Researchers worldwide have written testimonials to the reliability, accuracy, and consistency of Millar catheters and sensors. In 2001, Huntly Millar was awarded the Laufman-Greatbatch Prize by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) for outstanding accomplishment with a significant impact on a specific medical device. Included in the presentation was the statement, “Millar catheters have come to represent the ‘gold standard’ for accurate measurement to pressure, flow and volume in humans and have become essential for acquisition of accurate hemodynamic data in the assessment of pediatric and adult cardiovascular function.” Throughout Millar’s history, the goal of research and development has been two-fold: to decrease the diameter of the sensors so as to minimize the interference with the physiological parameters being measured, and to increase the number and kind of measurements that can be taken with a single, minimally invasive procedure. Their catheter products range from 8 French (2.67 mm diameter) to as small as 1 French (0.33 mm diameter) with single and multiple pressures, as well as velocity and electrode sensors for comprehensive pressure-volume studies. Millar also has a pressure-volume (PV) loop system, capable of simultaneously measuring high-fidelity left ventricular pressure and volume in small and large animal models. An important part of Millar’s success has come from working with medical researchers around the world. Millar is committed to being an integral part of this ongoing research by developing products and systems that further promote medical advancements and discoveries.",Health Care,,,101-250,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Private,,,,,,
