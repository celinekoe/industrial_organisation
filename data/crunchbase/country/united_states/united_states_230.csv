Current 12 month projected revenue - $2.6M Seeking $1,000,000 Use of Funds Staffing, development, marketing, and sales to profitability Leadership Team CEO / Founder Steve Kuntz COO / CTO / Founder Art Trevethan VP, Occupational Health & Safety John Svirbely, MD Summary Velocity Vue is in a unique position.  We have a sellable product and functional new MVP poised to address the corporate SaaS/PaaS market.  We have an existing commercial pipeline, and no debt or liabilities.  We have identified a problem that needs solving in a controlled market with massive potential.  Velocity Vue has the solution and expertise to solve this problem. Problem There is a niche within the safety and compliance market, where we have acquired expertise, and can deliver the required tool and generate revenue in 2017.  •	No software exists to address the safety compliance needs of contractors participating in Army Corps of Engineers projects.  Currently completed manually with high error rate. •	Safety and compliance users must be well trained in their efforts to be complaint while implementing many changing procedures and regulations. Updates must be distributed rapidly and efficiently while adherence is tracked.  •	508 ADA compliance is becoming more of a burden. •	Contractors are not paid if safety and compliance are not appropriately documented  •	Data generated from tasks must be collected and stored for analysis. •	App Fatigue from too many apps/icons on the device is causing less adherence. Solution Velocity Vue delivers an OS agnostic, mobile application development and delivery platform applying unique factors including; rapid development, repository distribution, ADA compliance, real time reporting, and an API architecture.  Laymen, within hours, are able to develop and deploy mobile apps, and gather data from usage. This process could take months in a traditional development and distribution environment. On this platform, Velocity Vue will deliver a specific solution for the needs of the construction safety market, including field users, contractor office, form production, and government backend.  These solutions will be sold as a SaaS low touch offering. Target Market Potential •	Focus on areas where safety and compliance are required or regulatory. •	Process application required for government construction safety compliance is desired by the Army Corps of Engineers. Represents $48M annual revenue. •	Civilian construction safety market represents opportunity of $1.3B Additional Opportunity The introduction of SaaS methodology will open the door to highly scalable Big Data and Internet of Things revenue opportunities. Velocity Vue addresses data, point solutions, and market needs.  “By 2018, more than half of all business-to-employee (B2E) mobile apps will be created by enterprise business analysts using codeless tools.” - Gartner Competitors Modo, Buzztouch, Form.com.

At the time our house consisted of a bunch of good friends, a halfpipe, pool table, ping pong table and shaping room all just across the street from some nice smooth hills down to the reefs. Being that the house had all these fine features, it became quite the hangout spot. One of our friends from Hawaii who used to call people “nineballs” all the time in a friendly razzing sort of way, called up on the phone one day to see what was going on at the house. Of course we were all “studying” so he got the answering machine and said “Whats going on over there at Sector 9?” which to him and us meant a house full of nineballs. At the same time one of the house favorite hill cruisers, a snowboard-turned-skateboard, was stolen from Northbird in La Jolla and a couple replacement boards were almost finished and just needed the finishing touches of a logo. The message on the machine was heard and the name not only had a nice ring to it but seemed fitting as well so it stuck. The interest had been apparent from everyone who saw us skate by so we started making skateboards in our backyard. Lots of learning and a couple evictions later we were forced to move into our first warehouse in what would become the Sector 9 skateboard factory.","Community and Lifestyle, Other",4,"Dave Klimkiewicz, Dennis Telfer, Steve Lake, Tal O'Farrell",101-250,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

BAT unlocks the marketing power of celebrity through research, endorsements, and interactive experiences. Celebrity & Research: Under the Steelbergs leadership, BAT has secured exclusive relationships with over 3750 athletes and celebrities.  As well, BAT's research engine tracks real-time consumer affinity metrics for more than 45,000 athletes and celebrities. The research engine is a hallmark of the Steelberg approach to entrepreneurship; because it applies proprietary, robust technology to a business in order to dramatically increase market adoption and growth.   Endorsements:  Advertisers use BAT's Endorsement Platform to identify, license, and activate the most effective talent for their campaigns. BAT's technology makes the process of securing endorsement talent much easier and more cost-efficient for advertisers. Instead of six-month contract negotiations and six-figure budgets, advertisers can activate endorsement campaigns featuring the most effective talent for a given campaign in a matter of days, and for a fraction of the cost.  BAT powers endorsement opportunities across all media including TV, radio, digital, social, and outdoor, to name a few.  Some of BATâ€™s advertiser clients include AT&T, Ford, General Motors, InterContinental Hotels, Intuit, McDonald's, Samsung, and Sony. Interactive Experiences:  In December 2010, Brand Affinity Technologies (BAT) launched Fantapper, a new technology developed exclusively for entertainment and sports fans, based upon fast-growing interest in connecting with celebrities online.  Fantapper populates celebrity and athlete images and stories online with relevant, interactive apps, giving people always-on access to proprietary content, news, YouTube videos, Twitter and Facebook feed, exclusive celebrity info, and more. More than 700,000 fans have already downloaded Fantapper. Leading websites, reaching more than 100 million unique users every month“also run the Fantapper application. BAT's high-paced growth can be attributed to the merits of BAT's technology as well as the Steelberg vision for mutually beneficial, business-accelerating partnerships with some of the most influential media, advertising, and sports companies in the country.","Advertising, Media and Entertainment, Sales and Marketing, Sports",1,Ryan Steelberg,11-50,5,,32394000,USD,32394000,32394000,USD,32394000,"Miramar Ventures, Matthew Pritzker Company, Newport Coast Investments, RimLight Capital, CGI Opportunity Fund II",2,5,2,Private,,,,,,

We feature submissions as much as possible throughout our comprehensive newsletters, our homepage, in press releases and other online marketing channels. We even built certain sections of our platform to highlight ""Featured Developers"" and ""Featured Apps"" that deserve added recognition. We are the resource for app developers to feature their best app creations. Nominees that win an award will be winning an award having been judged by numerous experts in app design and development. BMAA History & Background The Best Mobile App Awards journey started in 2012. Time flies when you're having fun, as it feels like just last month we app designers and developers were together in a room looking for a resource for better app exposure. We felt there needed to be one central authority to highlight the best mobile apps available on the market. After building the beta site, it was quickly overwhelmed with heavy traffic and lots of nomination submissions, so we knew we were on to something. BMAA was built as the platform to showcase and feature the latest and greatest apps all in one place rather than having to search and scroll through thousands of apps in the app stores.","Mobile, Platforms, Sales and Marketing, Software",1,Eric Solan,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
