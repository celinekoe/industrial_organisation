The firm is especially interested in businesses that are ready to pursue clinical trials or regulatory approval, although promising businesses at other stages might also be considered.

Dr. Leen Kawas comes to the investment firm from Athira Pharma, of which she was both Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer. At the pharmaceutical company, Dr. Kawas oversaw everything from drug discovery and clinical trials, to operations and financing. She has a doctoral degree in medical research. Richard Kayne has sustained a long career in private equity and venture capital, having established Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors in 1984. The Kayne Anderson firm grew to have billions under management. Richard Kayne has since been personally involved in several promising biosciences startups. A third member of Propel Bio Partners’ leadership team is Dr. Dasom Yoo, whose expertise is in regenerative medicine and stem cells. Dr. Yoo has previously conducted research at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. She is joining the private equity firm as a Senior Advisor. The trio is complemented by a board room that’s full of leaders from some of the top biosciences companies and high-level government agencies. These advisors have specialized expertise in many areas of research, medicine and business, and it’s Propel Bio Partners’ vision that companies the firm invests in will have access to board members when expertise is needed.

As an investment fund with a limited time-horizon, GHIF seeks opportunities that have a high probability of successful commercialization within two or three years.  Products with “dual market” potential are of greatest interest; i.e., those that will have a clear impact on public health in developing countries but also have value in high-income countries.  High-volume / low-margin products, such as essential vaccines, are also of significant interest. GHIF employs a range of investment structures including mezzanine debt, convertible debt, preferred equity and project financing with an average investment target of approximately $10 million per project.
