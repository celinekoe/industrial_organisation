They believe that the private sector is vastly underutilized as a tool for positive change, and that the right application of private sector ingenuity, funding, and technical know-how are the key to transformational change in government services to improve the lives of people in the developing world.    - The Problem They Solve  The World Bank, ADB, USAID, and other grant and donor agencies around the world have tried for many years to help emerging market economies improve government services and improve the lives of the people in these countries. Many well-intentioned programs go awry simply because of a combination of bureaucracy and misaligned incentives. The core of the problem: Companies hired on any of these programs are paid to WORK on the problem, not to SOLVE the problem. An insidious effect is that companies make more money by prolonging programs than they do by achieving results!    - The Solution  After years of frustration and observation, they designed a new approach that addresses this systemic problem through properly designed and privately funded projects that align incentives for the governments, the people, the funders, and the providers. Proof of their approach is being demonstrated right now in their first project.     Viva has established their first land registration and management project with the Kingdom of Buganda (Uganda). The Buganda Land Board (BLB) is the entity established by the Kabaka (King) responsible to manage all the land registration and transactions within the 9,000 square miles of Buganda, a Kingdom within the country of Uganda.    Their median projection indicates that $70 million will be collected over the next 10 years using this system with net returns near $30 million. They are installing their first registration center this March to support the landowners of Buganda and the BLB.",Other,3,"Jeffrey Christoph, Michel Vachon, Rick Whitaker",1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
