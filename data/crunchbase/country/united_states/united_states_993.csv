Dent as president and CEO of the Nashville physician practice management company earlier this year. Within the past few months, the company has formed Pivot Health as a wholly owned subsidiary to take the place of PhySis, its hospital clinic management operation. ""It will be the entity that will inherit Phycor's hospital-based clinic management business. We've had that business for several years,"" says Jones. ""We wanted to give it another name and we're renaming a number of companies and subsidiaries."" He says Pivot is outside of the bankruptcy proceedings, as was its predecessor. The company provides executive management for large, multi-specialty clinics within hospitals on a contract basis, Jones says. ""It was started two or three years ago and it's very profitable,"" he says. The company's revenues are in the $4 million range, Jones says.
