Introducing FYBN App nation’s 1st Retail Business Sale Tool which uses P/E based Algorithmic Model that gives you almost accurate value of the business based on last 3 months trailing averages of Inside Sales and takes into account of all the incomes and expenses and other parameters that decide the reliability of the business. Pairing ground-breaking real estate technology with fundamental industry experience, we created a platform where sellers could receive a strong purchase offer for their retail business, quickly contract and close, and avoid the hassles associated with traditional real estate selling. It all started with a joint vision for a better business selling experience shared among a group of top real estate professionals. After many years spent buying, selling, nearly 100s of CREB across the country, Dilip Mooparakath and his executive team gained a deep understanding of the challenges people face when selling their CREB. They found that even successful sellers were overwhelmed by the stress of selling – trying to guess what their business would sell for, prepping for showings, negotiating a deal and waiting for a closing date. Why wasn’t there a better way? We make Buyers make money from the Day 1 and We ensure Seller gets Top Dollars for their business. A Win Win Process. Recognizing the industry was long overdue for a change and equipped with a wealth of first-hand knowledge, Dilip and his fellow executives set out to offer something completely new. Their goal was clear: reinvent the Commercial Real Estate Business sale process and provide sellers with the convenience, control, and certainty they’d been lacking under the outdated system.

Their work has been cited in The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Time magazine, The Washington Post and USA Today. In 1985, McKenna launched California County magazine in partnership with the California State Association of Counties. Early to recognize the impact new digital technologies would have on the public sector, in 1987, Dennis launched Government Technology, the first national magazine covering information technology in state and local government. Other successful media platforms followed, including Public CIO and Emergency Management. All have won numerous editorial and design awards. In 2013, Emergency Management magazine was named Magazine of the Year for overall excellence by ASBPE (American Society of Business Publication Editors), Public CIO was named Magazine of the Year in 2007 and Government Technology and Emergency Management have both been named best publication in their respective categories by the Western Publishing Association. Seeing the need for stronger analysis and research to support public sector innovation, Dennis developed the Center for Digital Government—the first-of-its-kind research and business intelligence advisory institute focused exclusively on state and local government. The Center is home to the widely cited Digital States Survey. In 2009, e.Republic acquired Governing from Congressional Quarterly. Governing covers politics, policy and management for state and local government leaders. Recognized as the most credible and authoritative voice in its field, Governing provides non-partisan news, insight and analysis on budget and finance; transportation and infrastructure; workforce and economic development; health and human services and more. Since the acquisition, the publication has grown, with an expanded online presence and launch of the Governing Institute, headed by former Kansas City Mayor Mark Funkhouser. Governing has also greatly expanded its national events portfolio. In 2011 Governing received the prestigious Jesse H. Neal Award from American Business Media for exceptional editorial content.
