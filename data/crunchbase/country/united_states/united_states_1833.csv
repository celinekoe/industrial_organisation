With a long lasting, organic-based formula that minimizes pesticide exposure to your pets and family, Barefoot offers the most effective way to get rid of mosquitoes in the Austin, TX area. Austin is susceptible to mosquito infestations, and if you have lived in most any part of Texas long, chances are you’ve already tried other ways to kill mosquitoes or at least just keep them away. The challenge? These so called ‘solutions’ are not very effective, wear off quickly, overuse pesticides, or are just too expensive. So, many people in Austin are forced to avoid their backyards during mosquito season, which can be quite long some years. Without an effective mosquito system, your children can’t play outside without being bitten by mosquitoes, you can’t throw outdoor parties, and the beautiful pool in your backyard won’t be used nearly as much use as it could. Barefoot Mosquito offers a mosquito control system that helps Austin residents take back their yards again in an effective and environmentally responsible manner that offers these great benefits.  •	99.5% natural mosquito spray that reduces pesticide exposure for your pets and family •	A great organic mosquito control solution that is backed by a full satisfaction guarantee •	An affordable solution that does not require the purchase of expensive equipment or signing an annual contract Barefoot Mosquito is the best overall mosquito control solution in the Austin, TX area.

We are family owned and operated, so we know what our clients are looking for in our work. We strive to do our best to do quality work for both residential and commercial jobs. Call us today to learn more! Roadrunner Paving began as a custom paving business. That is, paving for others that did not have paving equipment, but had a project to pave. These projects included residential and arterial streets, parking lots and overlays. Initially, the company utilized bigger paving equipment such as a Blaw Knox paver. Currently, Roadrunner Paving still utilizes this heavy equipment but has expanded its line of equipment to service the smaller, tighter projects by purchasing a Lee Boy 8500. In addition to the smaller paving equipment and the ability to do repair work in the form of patching and removal/replacement, Roadrunner Paving has added the equipment to maintain your asphalt investment. Leon retired in 2002, and his son, David has continued on. He has been on the crew with his father since 1991, when he was just 18 years old. Rest assured, by contracting with Roadrunner Paving you are getting years of paving expertise and asphalt knowledge. Roadrunner Paving has the ability to meet any of your paving, asphalt, or asphalt maintenance needs. From new paving to maintenance, we have you covered!

Currently there are  less than 5 companies doing what they do with multiple vans on the road in the entire country and he believes they are in the best market.They have been in business for almost 5 years. My revenue grows close to 50% year over year. Revenue growth has slowed as they need to expand to keep up with demand.  They have exhausted their cash expanding last year. One of the ways that car manufacturers ""fix"" their problems in cars today is with software updates. The equipment to properly diagnose and update today's cars is  prohibitively expensive to the vast majority of repair shops. They have the tools to provide those services to individual shops and dealers for most makes and model 1996 and newer. Their business in in the Washington DC suburbs and the growth potential is phenomenal not including the name, logo, and business possibly ripe for franchising. I have neither the experience or capital to consider that at this moment and would consider most opportunities.  They have many shops, an example would be similar to Carmax. They have many cars a day they send to the dealer to get diagnosed. They are limited to what they can do in a parking lot out of a van and are looking to open a fixed location repair shop that would do the same thing Scan Man presently does with the addition of complete auto repair. Scan Man is my second successful business start up and the other was a repair shop. I personally consider success extremely likely in this market. The possibilities for the mobile operation alone can far exceed $2,000,000/year once fully expanded. They only do a tiny fraction of the VA suburbs, full expansion would be the DC area and the MD suburbs. The average household income in this market is approximately $120,000/year. They have 3 and sometimes 4 of the top five highest annual household income counties as their customers.
