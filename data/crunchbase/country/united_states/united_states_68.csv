LaceHub is a shoelace subscription service for those with a fashion-forward footwear fetish.  It’s kind of like Dollar Shave Club,  but with less sharp objects and more strings attached…(get what we did there?). How Does LaceHub Work? We keep your shoes upgraded with monthly shipments of new, custom laces.  Update each month’s shipment to include new lace styles, colors and sizes if you want.  Or, you can leave your order as is, and we’ll send you the same laces you ordered in the previous month – keeping your style consistent & fresh, month after month.  And of course, you can cancel or pause your subscription at any time. Ok…So How Much Does it Cost? The laces you select will be delivered to your US-based shipping address each month for $3-$6 per pair plus applicable taxes.  Oh and good news – Shipping is always free. What Other Costs Should I Be Aware Of? No other costs.  You pay $3 – $6 per pair plus taxes and we take care of all shipping costs.  Why would we pay for shipping costs? Because we like you & because we want to make the math easier on everyone. What About Hidden Fees? Late Fees? Tourism Fees? Seriously? Ok. This is getting a little old…no hidden fees! We don’t rent out or lease our laces.  So no, there are no late fees.  I am glad you brought up tourism fees because…No…there are no tourism fees.  You can pick those up at your local travel agent, but for us? We’ll stick to dealin’ laces. What About Returns, Money-Back Guarantees or Refunds? For now, we’ve decided that we will not accept returns and we will not offer money-back guarantees or refunds. Processing returns and refunds can take a lot of time and money, and since we believe in the quality of the products we’re selling, it would be hypocritical to allow either.  Once you have the laces, you own the laces. Do with them as you wish. If you are extremely unhappy with your order, you can email us with a detailed overview of your problems, and we will respond to work towards resolution. Other Questions? Feedback? Requests? Email us at LaceHub@gmail.com or Call us at 704-557-0017 to tell us what’s on your mind & someone will follow up with you as soon as possible.  Thanks! —————————————- Join LaceHub today and upgrade your footwear fashion for a fraction of what it would cost to buy new shoes.","Clothing and Apparel, Commerce and Shopping, Community and Lifestyle, Design",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
