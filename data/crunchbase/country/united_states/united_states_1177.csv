Reveral uses friend forward technology to connect people and businesses to companies they want to work with through people they know and pass persons forward to potential employers with a click.  Each business or individual can use Reveral to help build their reputation, by having references, certified skills and communication in one place. Now businesses can instantly see dimensionality to people and other companies in lieu of testimonials or expensive credit reports. Right now, many people are depending on social networks to try to employ themselves. But theyâ€:tm:re unable to effectively connect to whom they want to work with through people they know. Truth is friends can only go so far to help get your foot in the door. We know through Facebook how people subtly connect and why somehow itâ€:tm:s real easy to talk to someone you havenâ€:tm:t in 5 years. Reveral uses this social subtlety to connect people to those they may not know personally with value and without fear of overstepping.  In addition people can market themselves to fill specific needs of employers as compared to filling a job, which are far and few. Reveral users can better match a businessâ€:tm:s short term requirements, including taking on short term contracts, but being able to be reviewed with as much detail as if they were applying to be a full time employee.","Internet Services, Professional Services",1,Geoff Grandberg,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

While the monthly price tag may seem great for your budget, your online reputation will suffer in the long run if you do not have sustained results. Inoculation can take many forms depending on the status of your online reputation at the start of your Campaign. Certain search engines also give a lot of weight to certain consumer review websites such as Yelp and RipoffReport.com. Government and education-related websites also rank high as they are historically authoritative. It has to be fast.  But it can’t be just a quick fix. We work quickly and efficiently to get you the results you need but we take care to do the highest quality work that will have the strongest impact in the long run, not just a quick fix. Our methodologies are built to ensure the results are not only authoritative and substantive but that they appear natural (as if no campaign was ever performed.). It can’t look questionable There are times where a client engages with us after a prior campaign was attempted by others. The results of the prior campaigns were not controlled and do not appear natural. They contain questionable assets and content that is highly likely to raise suspicion that an attempt was made to reverse a negative reputation. A lack of strategy that  focuses on high-quality assets and content, unfortunately, invites greater scrutiny and deeper searching by third parties vetting your online reputation for trust. It must be credible and natural The solutions available by Reputation Management Consultants are meticulously architected to ensure both a credible controlled landscape, and one that is the highest in quality, and natural in appearance.","Internet Services, Sales and Marketing",,,101-250,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
