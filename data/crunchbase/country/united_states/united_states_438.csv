The Celsius Control System provides physicians with an endovascular technology that can rapidly and controllably lower patient body temperature, and precisely maintain a chosen target temperature for a desired period of time before allowing the patient to return to normothermic levels. The Celsius Control System consists of a specialized endovascular cooling catheter, fluid circuit disposables and an operational console. The distal portion of the catheter incorporates a flexible metallic heat-exchange region (called the Temperature Control Element(TM) or TCE(TM)), which can be cooled or warmed with saline solution circulated in a closed-loop manner from the console. When placed in the inferior vena cava, the TCE exchanges thermal energy with the blood, resulting in cooling or warming of the downstream organs and body. The Celsius Control System is particularly advantageous in that it can cool the body rapidly and controllably, yet does not infuse fluid into the patient, nor is blood circulated outside of the body. InnerCool recently launched its new Accutrol Catheter(TM), which integrates a temperature sensing probe directly into the catheter, avoiding the need for placing separate temperature probes which can be slow to respond and cumbersome to use, and may not reflect true core body temperature. Potential future applications of the technology include endovascular cooling for cardiac arrest, acute ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction (heart attack). InnerCool operates an approximately 17,000 square foot, FDA-registered and ISO-certified manufacturing facility located in San Diego, California.",Health Care,,,,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The Challenge: The place where a child is born should not determine the quality of his or her education and life prospects. However, the unfortunate reality is that a vast education inequity currently exists across our country. Just half of students in low-income communities graduate high school by age 18, and only 1 in 10 graduates from college. Closing this achievement gap will require cutting edge new approaches that address these challenges at a systemic level. There is a growing demand for solutions that use technology in creative ways to impact instruction and improve academic outcomes for historically underserved students. The Opportunity: The EdTech Entrepreneurs Lab is a program designed to seed innovative ideas among young professional leaders and aspiring entrepreneurs with a passion for education. This is an unprecedented opportunity for participants to design and launch truly innovative ventures that help close the achievement gap at asystemic level, with a particular emphasis on the power of technology to fuel solutions. Participants will have access to top resources in the education and technology fields – including workshops designed bythe Stanford Institute of Design’s K12 Lab – as they develop game-changing, technology-based solutions that target educational inequity.
