Mutations that cause NPC lead to impaired intracellular lipid trafficking and lead to lysosomal accumulation of cholesterol and biolipds. TRPML1 is an ion channel in the lysosome and a key regulator of lysosomal trafficking processes. Impaired TRPML1 function has been implicated in multiple pathological conditions, including NPC. Agonists of TRPML1 restore calcium efflux and normalize lysosomal trafficking and function. In addition to NPC and other lysosomal storage diseases, agonists of TRPML1 may have broad potential in other diseases such as muscular dystrophy and various taopathies such as Alzheimer's disease.

This model hasn’t been changed to reflect what today’s parents need : A convenient set-it-and-forget it approach to Baby Care that makes their busy lives easier; with high quality, design-oriented, earth-friendly products; and an opportunity for them to give to those in need with a purchase they are required to make.  Convenient.  You and your baby are at the core of our mission. We’re parents too; we know how busy life is and how little time you want to spend thinking about diapers. We’ve built the smartest, most flexible subscription model in the business. Our options enable you to choose the cadence that works for you, allows for multiple sizes within the same box, and enables a mix of our crowd-determined designs.  Conscientious.  We know how much your little one means to you, and that you want to make sure that any product touching their skin is gentle and effective (because blowouts happen!) We also understand how much you value the environment – you want it to be pristine for generations to come! For A&F, this means using the highest quality products that are gentler on the planet, with an eye for design.  Charitable.  Being a parent is one of the most universal experiences. We share many of the same hopes and dreams for our children – that they find their passion, experience gratitude and understand giving back. At A&F, we have built our business around giving back. Diaper need can have a huge impact in the lives of other parents and their ability to provide for their little ones, so A&F donates diapers to those in need for every purchase you make – because it’s never too early to start giving back","Apps, Clothing and Apparel, Commerce and Shopping, Community and Lifestyle, Design, Health Care, Mobile, Software",4,"Amanda Little, Kyle Anderson, Lance Little, Matt Anderson",1-10,2,Seed,500000,USD,500000,500000,USD,500000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Using the bedside TV, the GetWellNetwork system enables patients to view movies, access the Internet, play games and get health information on the television. Using technology in this way to achieve a more patient centered care experience is often referred to as, Interactive Patient Care (IPC). GetWellNetwork was founded in 1999 by CEO Michael Oâ€™Neil Jr., based on his experience with his own hospital experience during his 1999 battle with cancer. Over the next several years, the company deployed GetWellNetwork systems in hospitals around the country. In 2009 the company launched GetWell Town, an interactive patient care system designed for pediatric patients. The GetWellNetwork system, formerly named PatientLife, provides hospital patients with an assortment of entertainment amenities such as access to cable/satellite television, on-demand movies, email, web browsing, music and video games. In addition to entertainment, the GetWellNetwork system offers educational resources tailored for the patient's specific condition. The system includes a library of educational videos and content on specific health conditions, medications, tests and procedures. The patient education library offers material from content providers like, Milner-Fenwick, KidsHealth, Blausen Medical, Swank Motion Pictures, Wired.MD and others. Patients also have access to information about the hospital including visiting hours, staff profiles and patient care initiatives. The GetWellNetwork system delivers educational content relevant to patient diagnosis, prescribed medication, and overall health. Patient education is delivered to the patient using pre-defined workflows referred to as Patient PathwaysÂ®. Patient Pathways utilize best practice templates that enable hospitals to automatically customize a patientâ€™s hospital experience based on a variety of data inputs from existing hospital information systems. Data inputs trigger Patient Pathways to begin engaging patients in their own care. Prompts that appear on the patientâ€™s TV proactively engage each patient to learn more about their care, condition, safety and other aspects of their hospital stay. Patients proceed at their own pace through the multiple phases of each Patient Pathway. The patientâ€™s progress is recorded for reporting and to allow Nurses and staff to monitor the patientâ€™s real-time progress.

Specificity: They can be specific for a cell type. Scalable and low-cost production. High levels of cellular internalization. Nanotransfer delivery systems have a chemical affinity for the phosphate backbone, common to all nucleic acids, so the integration of the gene with the delivery system is independent of its sequence. We can decouple the synthesis of the delivery system and that of the geneof interest, which will allow a greater number of therapies to be developed with a positive impact on people´s health.

The Company’s initial focus is bladder cancer. The i/Blue Imaging System™ is expected to dramatically improve physicians’ ability to visualize cancerous cells. Working in conjunction with fluorescing imaging agents, this advanced, ultrasensitive imaging technology combines sophisticated opto-electronic functions and near-infrared fluorescence to deliver images far superior to conventional white light systems. Display options include separate blue or white light images, blue and white images displayed side-by-side, or a blending of the blue and white light images into one. Imagin believes the time savings will increase the efficiency of the operating room and potentially reduce healthcare costs by enabling procedures to be performed in the less expensive physician’s office. The i/Blue system was invented by Dr. Stavros Demos at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and validated in collaboration with the UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center and Dr. Ralph deVere White, one of the world’s leading authorities on bladder cancer. Imagin now holds the exclusive license to this intellectual property and relocated the final stage of development to the highly-regarded University of Rochester Laboratory for Laser Energetics (LLE) and its affiliated first-class Medical Center.  A Research Study using the i/Blue Imaging System prototype was led by Dr. Edward Messing and provided valuable input to the development of the final product for commercialization. Imagin’s engineering team has completed the Proof of Concept Phase and expects the Functional Phase to be completed by end of 2Q2019. As the i/Blue Imaging System becomes established in the urology market, the Company will complete development of the i/Vision Imaging System technology which combines multiple illumination sources into one system.
