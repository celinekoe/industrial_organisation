It will open the door for new possibilities in metal manufacturing by providing a faster, lower-cost to operate technology. Vader’s patent-pending MagnetoJet technology is based on the study of Magneto Hydro Dynamics (MHD), or more simply: the manipulation of liquid metal through magnetism. MagnetoJet’s extraordinary physics are accomplished by depositing Aluminum wire into an 800°C ceramic chamber, where it is influenced by a molten state. This molten media is then electromagnetically pulsed – causing a droplet to form and eject with precision from a carefully crafted ceramic nozzle. The Mk 1 delivers 1000 droplets per second with micron-level accuracy while doubling the speed of conventional 3D powder bed metal printers. Aluminum was an intentional first step, but MagnetoJet will evolve to printing additional conductive metals and potentially thousands of printing heads within one machine. The Mk2 – expected in 2018 – will contain 10 printing heads and produce parts 30x faster than the Mk1. Metallic design and manufacturing evolution will be exponentially impacted across all industries.","Hardware, Manufacturing, Software",2,"Scott Vader, Zachary Vader",1-10,1,M&A,,USD,,,USD,,"Blue Leaf Ventures, FKM Group, Jonathan Fentzke, OneTen Capital",1,4,,Private,,,,,,
