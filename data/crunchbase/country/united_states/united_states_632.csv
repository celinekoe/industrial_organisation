Officially launched in August 2010, DocSpot.com empowers people to find providers that are right for their individual needs by increasing the transparency and navigability of relevant information. Using an integrative approach, DocSpot pulls together data from over 600 publicly available sources into one unified interface. Sources include state medical boards, hospital and clinic physician directories, and reviews from around the web. The sources of the data on each provider's profile page are shown for the convenience of both the prospective patient and the provider. To keep the data fresh, DocSpot re-visits the sources on a regular basis. DocSpot believes that ""right"" care can mean very different things to each person and that doctors are as multidimensional as their patients. With that in mind, we developed a variety of innovative ways for users to search, filter, and select providers that fit their own unique requirements. Our service does not attempt to determine which doctors are ""better"" than others — instead, DocSpot offers information that allows each user to quickly find the providers that fit his or her individual needs. DocSpot strives to provide a comprehensive online provider directory where patients can easily look for doctors that suit their individual needs, and where providers can ensure that the right patients find them. With coverage in over 40 metropolitan areas, and plans to continue to grow, we hope to help people easily find the doctors they need.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Health Care, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

They utilize novel markers of tissue stem/progenitor cells as therapeutic targets. Utilizing tumor xenograft models created with human cancer cell lines, they have tested efficacy of our lead compounds. We have also developed a novel proprietary mouse cancer stem cell line that produces aggressive isograft tumors in immunodeficient mice. These tumors exhibit both epithelial and stromal features and tend to develop early metastases.  We hypothesize that candidate therapeutics active against these isografts are also likely to be effective in human tumors, which share similar features. The ability to generate and isolate tumor-initiating cells has enabled COARE to accurately predict the response of these cells to investigational compounds, either alone or in combination. These studies have given COARE the unique opportunity to assess the importance of specific target proteins and RNAs in both animal and human cancers. Furthermore this research approach has uncovered novel regulatory mechanisms associated with biological pathways that control cancer stem cell fate and plasticity. In addition to our proprietary siRNA mediated delivery platform, COARE is also developing panels of monoclonal antibodies against key stem cell signaling molecules expressed in tumor initiating cells. COARE’s continued dedication to advancing the science of stem cell biology has lead to an extensive pipeline of agents targeting multiple pathways and designed to eventually eradicate solid tumor cancer morbidity and mortality with the hope of ending the suffering of patients and families worldwide.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",1,Courtney Houchen,1-10,1,,,,,220099,USD,220099,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Instantly it was known for its professional, patient-centric operation style. The mantra that TGC followed was ""patients first,"" a mantra that has since been used by many other organizations entering the medical cannabis industry. TGC broke the mold in 2006 by morphing into a delivery service. Today, TGC still offers many strains, medicated edibles and smoking alternatives directly and discreetly to your home with the same friendly service and low prices people have come to expect. TGC has also been known as an exemplar in community and outreach services by offering patient consulting, care giving services, and an online community, going above and beyond traditional dispensary services, making it clear to not only its patients, but the community and the local government as well, that cannabis is much more important than many people deem it to be. On June 15, 2013, TGC finally opened a new storefront at 4218 Mission Street in the Excelsior District of San Francisco. It took over six years to find a location and get the storefront up and running, but with the support of our valued members and the neighboring community, They were finally able to open our doors. As an organization, it is our top priority to provide our patient-members with quality medication at the low prices they've come to expect from us. It is important to The Green Cross to offer our patients a comfortable and accessible place to come purchase medication from professional and courteous staff members. A primary goal of TGC is to improve the social and economic conditions of the neighborhood, while providing living wages to residents of the surrounding area. Since opening our storefront at 4218 Mission Street, They have employed several residents of the neighborhood. They take pride in providing employment opportunities to talented individuals from a diverse array of backgrounds. Moreover, TGC has taken the initiative to join various local neighborhood associations to help better the district They now call home.","Community and Lifestyle, Food and Beverage, Health Care, Other, Science and Engineering, Social Impact",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

We loved the neat details we could tell about them, and the attention we could bring by showcasing them next to established and classic names.  It’s a shop-around-the-corner mentality, an old-timey care for what we buy and how we sell it, but with the lifestyle of today: easy, always new, affordable, and accessible online and off.  It’s who we are as consumers: local devotees always plugged into our global networks, and it’s how we wanted to change shopping everywhere.
