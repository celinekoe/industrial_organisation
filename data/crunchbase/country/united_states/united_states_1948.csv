RM Innovation,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rm-innovation,"Computer, E-Commerce, Retail, Software","Louisville, Kentucky, United States",RM Innovation empowers retailers with business solutions expertly crafted for the Rug and Home Furnishings industry.,"684,062",Southern US,$1M to $10M,Active,,,,,,,For Profit,https://portal.rminno.com/,"RM Innovation founder David Khazai was running rug stores around the country. But as he went through the day-to-day operations of running his stores, he kept hitting the same walls—the technological tools he needed to be successful just weren’t available. Feeling this pain first-hand, he found himself saying two very important words: “What if?”     What if there was a tool that made operations seamless and efficient for the smaller retailer? What if he could create a simple solution that completely automated best practices in the rug industry? One thing Mr. Khazai had learned from his own business experience was that if you can measure it, you can manage it– and if you can manage it, you can grow it. With this insight in tow, he started building RM Pro, a point of sale and inventory system that incorporated powerful measurement capabilities.     His first experiences in market validation were simple and straightforward. He would meet with retailers and start by saying “Imagine a tool that could do this… and this… or this” then he would ask them if these capabilities would help their businesses. As Mr. Khazai continued to receive more and more positive feedback on his retail software, it fueled him to keep innovating and pushing his vision forward.     RM Pro evolved into a great success, but by 2008 Mr. Khazai realized there was another bottleneck. Worse, big-box stores and dot-coms with endless resources were taking sales away from smaller retailers. He wanted to know what industry giants had that the smaller guys with decades of retail experience didn’t. This was when he realized the vital importance of product data, and once again he was back to those two powerful words: “What if?”     What if every vendor’s product data could be standardized across the industry? And what if vendors could stream this data right to their retailers, in real time? The answer to these questions led to the first version of Datalink, which integrated with the RM Pro solution.     Realizing the infinite possibilities Datalink could bring to the industry, Mr. Khazai had a new vision for the home furnishings industry. In 2010, he officially launched RM Innovation and started assembling a team, recruiting talented and passionate individuals that could push mere ideas into tangible realities. From that point on, RM Innovation has kept innovating, now providing a suite of solutions including point-of-sale, product data streaming, and E-commerce. These are the solutions that empower retailers to succeed and achieve real growth in today’s market.     In 2015, RM Innovation was officially recognized as a leader in innovation at the Icon Honors award ceremony in Atlanta. They were awarded the GHTA’s Medal of Excellence honor for their revolutionary Datalink solution, which standardizes any vendor’s data and streams it to a retailer’s POS and web store in real time.","Commerce and Shopping, Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Software",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Unsupervised ML finds new patterns in your data and is better at anomaly detection. Our tool finds brand new patterns in data which is important when dealing with changing macroeconomic conditions. This is especially necessary when dealing with fraud, predictive modeling, and rule optimization. Why we’re the ones building it: We’re making something that our data scientists wish they had when they worked at their prior companies (Capital One, Tesla, Fidelity, DARPA/DoD). Because we regularly faced the problems we are solving for, we’re the best primed to build this tool for users like us at companies all over the world. So, what can you expect? 1. We’ll alert you within 24 hours when there has been a fundamental change in the makeup of the data coming into your models. 2. Our anomaly detection is best-in-class. We R&D-ed and integrated our own method of ensembling multiple unsupervised ML models together to improve anomaly identification by 35% over single model anomaly detection.  3. Our tool finds patterns in your data without needing that data to be fully (or perfectly) labeled, which is needed for supervised ML.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Science and Engineering, Software",1,Joe Lacy,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Capstera,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/capstera,Software,"Los Gatos, California, United States",Capstera is a company that helps existing companies to deveolop a stronger architecture for them.,"684,436","San Francisco Bay Area, Silicon Valley, West Coast",$1M to $10M,Active,2012-01-01,day,,,,,For Profit,http://www.capstera.com,"Capstera leverages capabilities as the capstone of business definition and combines best elements of business architecture, capabilities mapping, process analysis, and requirements management to foster alignment across business and IT, reduce redundancy and rework while promoting reuse, and align execution with strategy.  Although capability architecture is becoming a fountainhead discipline for enterprises, it is still primarily IT trying to model the business in order to meet its own needs for improved IT landscape oversight and management. Business architects tend to be highly trained IT engineers and managers with significant training, and a set of complex, IT-centric tools. There is currently a lack of focused and easy-to-use business tools to help model a business. As a result, business is often missing or peripheral to capability architecture’s definition of business.  Capstera fuses the elements of business architecture, capability mapping & management, and requirements management to help engage business in creating the picture perfect business definition. This can then be used by the business to translate strategies into actionable capability-specific roadmaps, manage overlaps across products, projects and initiatives, communicate & manage requirements with IT, and help IT manage project complexity, among other benefits.  Capstera Features & Benefits •	Craft capability models using intuitive and easy-to-use inline editing and drag-and-drop functionality that business and IT can both use without advanced business architecture training  •	Compose platforms, initiatives/programs and service offerings using underlying capabilities as “Lego” blocks, thus establishing a common and MECE language between business and IT  •	Collect & manage requirements by capabilities instead of trying to manage them across a large number of IT projects with poorly defined interdependencies o	Helps quickly identify conflicts &  synergies, avoiding silos and unnecessary redundancy o	Fosters reuse by identifying similar capabilities, therefore also improving time-to-market  o	Establishes traceability and transparency of requirements to individual capabilities  o	Reduces requirements churn  •	Visualize a variety of lenses and heat maps to shed light on relationships, dependencies, relevance, overlaps and gaps, such as matching high-level strategy to capability-specific objectives •	Bridge the gap between capabilities and services and therefore provide the transition from a business model to a services model •	Capture rich semantic information and attributes for each capability, which can further improve communication and integration with the business strategy •	Create value streams and upload processes to overlay the “How” with the “What”  •	Draft Business Rationale, Strategy and Tactics (BuRST) to make the business strategy actionable at the capability level and to help focus on long-term capability evolution instead of yearly projects that typically generate silo’ed functionality   •	Help service architects define modular and coarse grained IT services based on capability semantics and rationalize application portfolio by analyzing systems at a capability level",Software,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
