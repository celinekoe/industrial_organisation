Solving the problem of how to ensure that their personal coins were safe from the wet, humid, and corrosion inducing climate of their home state of Florida was the first step. The next steps evolved into countless tests, trials and missteps but eventually they found a solution that gave them the peace of mind they desired; the knowledge that their coins could be safe from any threat – be it flood, fire, physical damage, physical theft, and especially digital theft. Once their own feelings of security had been attained, they realized that the crypto-currency community also deserved this solution. A solution that not only met the same security requirements that Their co-founders had, but also embraced the intent that crypto-currencies were invented with – that trust of third parties was no longer necessary and one could be one’s own bank.","Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Payments",2,"Brian Atchley, Cody Maher",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

READ THIS!    TapNSell is a peer to peer mobile market place best described as ""The World's Garage Sale"" that makes it super easy to sell items online with your smart phone.     You Simply:    1. Take A Picture  2. Enter a short description and price  3. Share it on Social Media and can also easily post to Craigslist & Ebay    This makes it the easiest, and most convenient way to sell any unwanted items right from your smart phone.    Competitive Landscape:    1. Quickr - Has raised $196 million so far but only focusing on India right now and is only classified ads like Craigslist. What makes TapNSell different is that it has a market place and payment processing built in. Allowing us to earn 20% of every transaction. The proven business model that has made apps like AirBNB & Uber worth billions of dollars.    2. ETSY - Which has raised $97.3 million but only focused on hand crafted items right now. TapNSell covers all items and opens peer 2 peer selling to all average internet users not just craft people. This gives us a much larger market share modeling a proven business model.    3. Snap Deal which has raised $1.1 Billion but only focusing on selling discounted items in India right now. What gives us a competitive advantage is that since we are a peer to peer market place we don't have to invest heavily in stocking and managing inventory. This is how other peer to peer market places such as Airbnb and Uber have scaled to become multi billion dollar businesses.    We understand how to get users at SCALE! Previous projects generated billions of impressions, millions of visitors, and millions of dollars in online sales.     Experts at selling products online and mass user acquisition. Helped iContact get acquired for $169 million dollars and was the inspiration for creating TapNSell.     We took all of our knowledge on selling products online and acquiring users and built it into an easy app that the mass market can use to easily sell items online.","Commerce and Shopping, Mobile, Other",1,Lupe Garcia,11-50,2,,,USD,,,USD,,FundedByMe,,1,,Private,,,,,,
