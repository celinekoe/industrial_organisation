The problems we are solving are: 1. The environmental concerns- It’s about the destruction of trees to produce paper ballots. Papermaking has an impact on the environment because it destroys trees in the process. According to data from the Global Forest Resource Assessment eighty thousand to one hundred and sixty thousand trees are cut down each day around the world with a significant percentage being used in the paper industry.  2. Ballot waste & health risk- The cost of scanner ballot is approximately $0.29 each versus Votrite paper ballot at $0.03. The printing of scanner ballots is estimated for voter consumption. Millions of ballots are thrown away at a cost of $0.29 each (taxpayer $) in every election, because it impossible to decide how many ballot are need for each election, while Votrite print the ballot as requested by the Administrator or voter at $0.03 each. Votrite paper is phenol-free thermal paper. Those who work every day with thermal paper containing phenol can have long-term BPA exposure which has been linked to several health conditions, such as prostate and breast cancer. 3. Voter participation- Scanner ballot and paper ballots used to vote may have two sides with two languages versus Votrite which comes in any language as shown in languages ballot folder.  4. Security issues- Votrite is never connected to the internet. Each voting machine has its own database folder and operating program with redundant memory features. Votrite’s fully encrypted program with other features deters access from hackers and malicious viruses. Votrite, the new disruptive secured voting system that currently rents and sells voting systems with custom-made software programs for elections, and related items for law enforcement, unions, associations, universities, homeowners associations, and a host of other government municipalities who vote for organized membership representation, candidates, and propositions. This is a recession-proof and redundant industry. Over the last ten to fifteen years, we have seen a significant shift in what the power of touch screen technology does for our everyday lives. Sensitive information we once wrote down and stored away in a safe place physically is now stored in a secure database electronically. Examples include how we bank, grow wealth and store financial data, as well as the storage and sharing of our own personal and private health care information.  Free and fair elections are vital to the functioning of democracies because they ensure citizens have a say in the future of their nation. It is extremely important that the voting process is made to be just, simple, and accessible. Electronic Voting Systems (EVS) make the process easier because the interface is more streamlined, less expensive, and environmentally protected than paper ballots.  They are more effective in countries with large populations because they increase the speed of counting and are more cost-effective because they do not require spending on paper, printing, and distribution. Moreover, EVS can be used to facilitate voting in many other sectors.  Votrite has now been approved for Federal Testing (www.eac.gov) and upon approval, the Federal Market for elections will be available to rent and sell our voting systems to all States.","Consumer Electronics, Education, Hardware, Software",2,"Angelica Kapsis, Jim Kapsis",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

It uses advanced mathematics to determine where on the course it makes sense to power up and power down to hit the best time for a given power target. How does it work?  Athletes enter rider data as well as details about their bike and equipment. Many specific technical details such as drag and rolling resistance are auto-calculated, but more advanced users can overwrite these values based on wind-tunnel data or their own testing. Courses containing GPS data can be uploaded from devices such as a Garmin or selected from the existing course library. The race plan is then created with a few more details, such as road conditions, weather conditions and specifying the type of model you would like to run. Currently we have 3 advanced models; the Normalized Power Model determines the optimal pacing and race strategy to minimize time while targeting a specific Normalized Power goal, the Goal Time Model uses your goal finish time to determine the optimal pacing and effort needed to complete a course in that time, and the Training Stress Score Model which uses a goal target training stress score value to optimize your power pacing for the course. What’s in a race plan?  The main power plan chart displays an overlay of power, estimated speed and the course elevation profile. The yaw angle distribution chart shows how much time an athlete will spend in each yaw angle range for the race. This can be extremely useful for equipment selection or if an athlete was planning to purchase a new set of wheels or bike frame. Other summary results include details like estimated race time, average power, normalized power, training stress score and average yaw angle. Some of these metrics are more advanced, but once they are understood can be very powerful especially for long distance triathlon athletes looking to have a good run off the bike. Along with the charts and summary data, the athlete can also download multiple file types that are compatible with both popular training applications such as CompuTrainer or Trainer- Road as well as popular cycling computers and watches like the Garmin Edge 500, Garmin 910XT, or the PowerTap Joule GPS.",Sports,1,Ryan Cooper,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
