On one side of the platform, users can easily create and electronically sign this important form - no more papers that get lost or tampered with. Users can then share this information with loved ones electronically via email or create special care networks through our Facebook app. On the other side of the TrueNorth platform, this critical information is made accessible through integration with electronic medical record platforms so that it can be made available where and when it's needed - in the hospital, in the emergency room, in your doctors' hands.
