The premise was that if real estate professionals and commissions were holding up desperately needed transactions, then that would be a disservice to the community. This was because many people could have sold their homes, if not for the traditional fees and efficient processes associated with real estate. Also of note, many people would have been willing to do somethings on their own to save a lot of money in a real estate transaction process.  Why is happening Friealtor now?
