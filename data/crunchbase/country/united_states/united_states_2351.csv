Dealing with big data is not an easy issue. It is not only about the statistical software, we have the open source R, and the powerful hardware, we can easily have 1000 of instances with cloud providers; it is all about the ease-of-use, the cost and the experience.  Commercial cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) promote its simple and fast access to general computing and hosting. But this is not true for most of the academicians and enterprises. You need at least an expert to spend some hours to setup the R statistical environment before your analysis. And it is just an instance. If you have computation intensive analysis, you will need a cluster of sereval instances with different layers of big data stacks. All the installation and configuration are becoming more and more complex. We’re just data analysts. We just want to focus on data analysis. Why is it so hard? And end out nothing after some days of hardwork and resources wasted? KloudStat, a cloud integrated development environment for open source R, provides the academicians and enterprises the platform to perform and focus on big data analytic processes that are critical in decision making without dealing with the backend production environment, such that KloudStat as a fast, scalable, distributed system can start with on a single server within a minute and expand to a cluster of instances optimized for each tier, i.e. R clusters, Hadoop clusters, databases and application servers of the system automatically.  Besides giving the freedom of data intelligence to everyone at anywhere, anytime across multiple platforms, KloudStat’s collaboration feature allows a small group of collaborators can interact and do statistical analyses real-time with the virtual console, finally the source editing while all will be completely synchronize with local R software.  KloudStat’s most interesting feature would be the modules or more advanced, big data applications development, which allows developers to implement the statistics engine in R with KloudStat APIs, while envolved in a top layer defined like a user interface. The main layer coordinates the lower layers where different engines based on several architectures are implemented. Each modules or applications created that contains many features are for specific task or purpose. These modules or apps allows faster data analysis and for everyone even don’t have programming knowledge.  KloudStat was built based on Rstudio server with pre-configured big data stacks, such as Hadoop. You can start analyzing your data as soon as you login to your console dashboard, no cluster configuration needed as all is automated and optimized. So far, the user had to start his R session with special MPI command. MPI binding is automatically created in the background and you can start your computer cluster using the packages snow, Rmpi or foreach without any additional steps.

Like other business social networks, individuals can sign up and create a profile in a resume format listing their work experience and the degrees they have received. Unlike other social networks, an individual's social graph is composed of Personal Contacts and Acquaintances: being someone's Personal Contact releases more personal information to that person than being an Acquaintance. When looking at someone's profile it is then easy to identify who the people who matter to that individual are. Also, the shortest path between two individuals is always calculated by selecting Personal Contacts over Acquaintances relationships: if the optimum shortest path between you and someone contains only Personal Contacts, then you know that there's a good chance for you to get in touch with that person. Moreover, businesses can also have profiles. Users can be linked to multiple businesses as an employee or customer. Once a user is linked to a business, he has access to screens and features for this business based on his responsibility. The user can then work and collaborate online with other employees or customers: track issues, upload and manage documents, schedule meetings, publish and bid on RFPs, manage projects, etc. Businesses can also be matched with prospective suppliers and customers based on the products and services that they offer and need; this is similar to dating sites for individuals.

With Keep, people who have extra space in their basement can rent it out to an apartment-dwelling neighbor who needs a safe spot to store a bike, or their winter clothes. College students can rent an empty bedroom from people in the community to store their furniture over the summer. That empty spot in your garage can turn into real income – and a safe place for your neighbor to park their car or store Grandma’s tea set.  Pay for the storage you need, and no more.
