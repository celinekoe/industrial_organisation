Josh Goldman, the President of Bargold Storage Systems, has been involved with the self storage industry for over two decades. His approach to self storage is unique in that it does not utilize any permanent on site personnel; depending upon “roving” field representatives instead. In order to be able to manage these remote employees, he developed his own software system, the precursor to eTRACKER Software. Leveraging this technology, he has grown from 5,000 storage units to 16,000 units at over 1500 separate locations ...all with minimal increase in staffing. In 2007, Josh approached Glenn Hunter, Founder and President of DOMICO Software; a company with a 30+ year track record of providing quality management and accounting software to the self storage market. Glenn and Josh spent several years further developing the original Bargold eTRACKER Software. They created eTRACKER LLC in late 2010 and then brought on Adrian Hunter to lead the new venture. Chris Thompson joined the team as EVP to oversee rolling out the technology to new markets beyond self storage, with an eye towards Commercial Real Estate. Chris has successfully leveraged his background in commercial real estate, having spent 6+ years with the Sequoia Group in Newport Beach, CA. eTRACKER is presently being used to manage hundreds of self storage, office, retail, industrial and residential properties throughout the U.S.",Real Estate,1,Adrian Hunter,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Described as the sports equivalent of The Awl, the site was launched in December 2011 by several members of the basketball blog FreeDarko, including Bethlehem Shoals and Eric Freeman, and features other writers such as Eric Nusbaum, Tom Scharpling, Tim Marchman and Lang Whitaker. In August 2011, it was announced that Shoals and others would be launching a sports website featuring a prominent collection of writers that had written for Sports Illustrated, ESPN, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Nation, Slate, Deadspin, GQ and other publications. A Kickstarter page was established by the site's founders, and $50,000 were raised to help maintain the site for its first year. The Classical launched in December 2011. The site's approach to long-form sports writing instantly drew comparisons to Grantland, the ESPN-funded website that had been launched by Bill Simmons the year before. On the site's Kickstarter page, the founders of The Classical wrote that the intention of the site was to create something completely original, stating: ""We will make no attempt to be comprehensive, or even to offer a reliable guide to the world of sport at a given moment. We will not try to be a smarter version of what you can find elsewhere. Instead, The Classical will be a running, wide-ranging conversation between us and our readers about baseball, basketball, soccer, football and fighting, and about things that aren't sports, too. Our model in this regard is The Awl, a site for which many of us have written and which all of us love."" The name of the site is in reference to the first track of the 1982 album Hex Enduction Hour, by the English post-punk band The Fall. Pete Beatty, one of the site's founders, said the name was appropriate since ""it is probably fair to describe The Classical as post-punk sports journalism.""","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment, Sports",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
