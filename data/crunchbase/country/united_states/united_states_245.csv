The founders of FundHero spent years searching for the right tool to help local candidates and nonprofits get organized and raise money. Too much money gets left on the table due to lack of organization and messy, complicated tracking system but they couldnt find anything. After some time we decided to embark on a journey to create the tool we had always been looking for. Enter FundHero! It needed to be a low-cost, easy-to-use tool that was something between a spreadsheet and a full-blown donor system. It needed to be quick, simple, and intuitive while being modern and mobile. It needed the versatility and chicness of a Spidey suit, but it didnt need all the flashy gadgets of Batmans. Something to help users through common roadblocks but not so complicated they needed dedicated staff to make it work. Oh yeah. It also needed to be cheap! In 2016 we embarked on a journey to fill that need for local campaigns and non-profits. A simple, forward-thinking fundraising tool designed to attract the next generation of organizers, but robust enough to capture battle-hardened fundraisers. The initial beta was an iron suit built in a cave. Rugged, tough, and a little inflexible, but it muscled its way through to get the job down. Now, the backend has been revamped, a shiny red design was added, and the tools necessary to support your quest were added. We are always upgrading our sidekick tools aiming to make you the best Hero out there. *Cue the superhero music*.

It consists of the Chief Justice of the United States and eight Associate Justices who are nominated by the President and confirmed with the advice and consent (majority vote) of the Senate. Once appointed, Justices effectively have life tenure which terminates only upon death, resignation, retirement, and conviction on impeachment. The court meets in Washington, District of Columbia, in the United States Supreme Court building. The Supreme Court is primarily an appellate court, but it has original jurisdiction over a small range of cases. With few exceptions, the life of a U.S. Supreme Court case begins when a lower court case ends since the Supreme Court is primarily a court of appeals. The losing party in a lower court case must request entry onto the court’s calendar. The justices then decide whether to hear the case, the crucial factor being whether the case can shed new light on an issue of constitutional law. The court hears about 100 of the 10,000 cases that compete for a spot on the court’s calendar each year. Once the court agrees to hear the case, lawyers from each side must submit written arguments. Each justice will typically choose a clerk to review the arguments and prepare a memo, outlining the issues the case presents. The lawyers for each side are informed the date of their oral arguments. Shortly before oral arguments, justices review the memos so that they can anticipate each party’s argument and the theories behind their reasoning. Each party receives half an hour for their oral arguments, including questions from the justices. The justices are seated in order of seniority with the Chief Justice seated in the center. Justices often question the lawyers as their arguments proceed.

Their first product, the CryptoBioSecure™ is a hardware “cold” fingerprint wallet that addresses specific needs of digital currency owners with biometric authentication for accessing a user’s cryptocurrency account without the need for passwords. The user’s fingerprint is captured with highly sophisticated encryption and uses this algorithm as the password, phrase, pin and seed. One of the most compelling features of the fingerprint wallet is not just the ability to identify the owner’s fingerprint, but also determine if the input is from that live person. The fingerprint reader in their fingerprint wallet is so technologically advanced that it can actually read the pulse and blood flow of a fingerprint to verify that the authentication is from a live person, and not just an image of their fingerprint. They feel capacitive biometrics will be the future method of authorization for many applications ranging from credit card payments to rental cars and medical records. ITBiometrics™ will be at the forefront of all efforts to improve security, reduce risk, and deliver a seamless and convenient user experience in all areas where identification is critical. As a team, they work collaboratively with industries, companies and consumers to deliver products that solve these types of problems.
