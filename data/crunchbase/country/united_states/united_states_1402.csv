Originally, the intention was to create an easy-to-use software package that did not require exceedingly large amounts of computing power. MapInfo provided the first tools to Microsoft that allowed them to include the mapping functionality in their products, specifically the mapping add-on branded as Microsoft Map for Microsoft Excel as part of MS Office 95. The add-on was subsequently included in Microsoft Office 97 and Microsoft Office 2000.

I had forsaken a career as an architect in favor of sawdust and the satisfaction of building things with my own hands, something that still gives me tremendous pleasure. That was many shops and a mountain of sawdust ago. Now operating out of converted airplane hangars in Calverton with over 180 employees, the dedication and passion that moved me to build my first project thirty years ago remains a key component of our success today. State-of-the-art technology along with the skilled eyes and careful hands of master craftsmen who remain our lifeblood empower us to produce the highest quality windows, doors, screens shutters, millwork and cabinetry available anywhere in the world. From the very beginning, our company’s fine reputation and breadth of offerings has grown due to the beauty and superiority of our final product, a fact that has become our hallmark and a source of tremendous pride. The outcome of our commitment to excellence in everything we do is the fulfillment of your vision as the discerning customer.
