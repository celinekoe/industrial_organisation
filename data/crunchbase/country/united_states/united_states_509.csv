The websiteâ€™s main purpose is to help educators and schools around the world effectively integrate technology, including the wonderful tools on the vast World Wide Web, into the classroom. eduTecher provides links to thousands of Web Tools and provides concise information on how these tools may be useful in the classroom setting. The siteâ€™s goal is simple: contribute to the academic world, without charging membership fees for the users or promoting specific software and hardware products through commercial advertising. Besides the wealth of links to Web Tools, users can also find self-produced webisodes of eduTecherTV with walkthroughs and demonstrations on how to use specific Web Tools for educational purposes. The site also has various articles and archived presentations that aim at providing insight into successful educational technology integration. eduTecher was the first educational resource to produce an iPhone app and currently has an Android app as well.  The iPhone app won great praise as it was featured in iPhone Life Magazine.  It has been installed on over 12,000 iOS devices.  In 2011 eduTecher will add a multitude of social features and improvements to the site including a way for teachers to connect with one another and chat, send messages, share their favorite links that they find on the site, share notes on these links, rate the links, tag the links, create their own blog on the site, and participate in forums.   It is also worth noting that eduTecher ran a very successful charity campaign entitled, ""eduTechers Change the World"" which was written up in various magazines and copied by students, teachers, and bloggers from all around the web.  For each of the 20,000+ users that clicked on a ""penny link"", Adam Bellow, eduTecher's Founder, donated a cent for each click.  The users of the site then voted on the charity to which they wanted the money to go.  The winner for the first round was The Make a Wish Foundation.  Bloggers are currently running the same charity idea in order to raise awareness and donate money to various relief efforts for the Tsunami and Earthquake in Japan.","Education, Internet Services, Software",1,Adam Bellow,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The most common causes of anaphylactic reactions are food allergies and insect stings. Less common causes are latex allergy, drug allergies and animal bites. Epinephrine autoinjectors became available in the early 1980s, allowing patients to self-administer epinephrine when experiencing the onset of anaphylaxis. To date, over 50 million autoinjectors have been dispensed. Yet the population at-risk for anaphylaxis far exceeds the number individuals having autoinjectors. This is thought to be due to the fact that many patients and caregivers have difficulty properly using autoinjectors and many are reluctant to use them due to fear of needles.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",2,"Mike Doodson, Nigel Ten Fleming",1-10,1,Seed,235000,USD,235000,235000,USD,235000,,,,,Private,,,,,,
