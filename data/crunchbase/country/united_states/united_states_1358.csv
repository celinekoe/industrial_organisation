Facing a heavy post-war migration to the area and its consequent automobile boom, these people discussed ways of easing the mounting congestion that was clogging the bridges spanning the Bay. In 1947, a joint Army-Navy review Board concluded that another connecting link between San Francisco and Oakland would be needed in the years ahead to prevent intolerable congestion on the Bay Bridge. The link? An underwater tube devoted exclusively to high-speed electric trains. Since 1911, visionaries had periodically brought up this Jules Verne concept. But now, pressure for a traffic solution increased with the population. In 1951, the State Legislature created the 26-member San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit Commission, comprised of representatives from each of the nine counties which touch the Bay. The Commission's charge was to study the Bay Area's long range transportation needs in the context of environmental problems and then recommend the best solution.",Transportation,,,1001-5000,1,,,,,6800000,USD,6800000,Federal Emergency Management Agency,1,1,,Private,,,,,,

There are also more than 15 graduate programs. Not only do nearly 100% of faculty hold doctorates, but they also work on pioneering research with students and with local businesses and organizations as well. Research areas include such fields as Biological Sciences, Biomedical Studies, Nanotechnologies and Wireless Communications. Opportunities for work abound for NJIT grads in great part because of the quality of student training and the reputation of the school. Also important are the internships, which the school arranges for students while they’re still studying. Classrooms and research centers aren’t the only place on the NJIT campus that employ the most current technologies. The renovated campus recreation areas, computer labs, and restaurants add to the contemporary look and feel of the NJIT experience. Since Newark is the largest city in New Jersey there are also many employment opportunities available in the area. With its restaurants and cultural activities, Newark also provides much in the way of recreation and culture. New York City is also only 20 minutes away, so there is even more to be found in the off-campus experience. Admission to NJIT is competitive and undergraduates who are accepted usually have high grades and test scores. Many eligible undergraduates receive some form of financial aid.","Education, Other",,,1001-5000,6,,,,,9993939,USD,9993939,"U.S. Department of Education, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Science Foundation, U.S. Department of Labor, Leir Charitable Foundations",5,5,,Private,,,,,,
