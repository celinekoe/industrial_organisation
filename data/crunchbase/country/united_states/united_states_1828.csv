Waste heat has long been recognized as a vast energy resource. Waste heat power generation equipment is already a fast-growing industry with players like GE and United Technologies. However, all current technologies require waste heat of 200-500 degrees F or more and most require as found in industrial sites. Most if not all require large amounts of cooling water. Untapped until now is over 1 trillion kWh per year of low-grade waste heat from commercial air conditioning and refrigeration, equal to the heat from over 170,000,000 tons of coal.  Every watt of electricity used for AC/R results in about four watts of this easily captured heat, with a typical temperature of 120 degrees F, varying by time of day and season. This new patented technology uses the intermittent and variable temperature low grade heat. The system uses a new patented mode of heat transfer and recycles its own waste heat.  It does not require cooling water. The technology is scalable for commercial buildings from fast food restaurants to supermarkets and up, opening a new market for U.S. made equipment worth $50 billion and rising.  We have invested over 5 years and over $2M in development to date. Now it is time to take the technology to market in commercial systems.  With patented technology, a proven capital-efficient business model, seasoned management, and a sensible plan, American Thermal Power has enormous upside potential.","Consumer Electronics, Energy, Hardware, Information Technology",1,Bob Waterstripe,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
