Z Glass breathes new life into the entire idea of interior design by utilizing custom glass products. This New York Based Interior Design and Glass Distributing Firm specializes in importing European artistic glass to the United States for use in residential and commercial construction and decoration. Headquartered in New York City, with plans currently underway to open showrooms in New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago, and Florida, Z Glass Design works with Interior Designers and Architects, in a variety of different industries: residential, commercial, and hospitality (hotels, bars, restaurants, nightclubs). These products transform mere rooms to sophisticated, elegant, and unique spaces. Zoltan Pongracz, CEO of Z Glass Design Inc., first put his artistic background to work when he immigrated to the United States in 1992 from Eastern Europe. He was cultured and educated in the arts and is an expert finisher. Over time, he formed long-lasting business relationships with some of the country's elite, high-end designers and companies such Christopher Peacock's Cabinetry and Smallbone of Devizes UK. For over 13 years, Zoltan has specialized in interior design, working on some of the world's most elegant homes. Z Glass Design's products are rooted in art. In 2000, Zoltan reunited with his childhood friend, Zoltan Krizsan, who is an award winning, free hand artist from Budapest, Hungary. His work uses a unique and innovative technique of working with layered painted glass to achieve a revolutionary style. At the World Art Foundation in Los Angeles, Krizsan's artwork surpassed hundreds of artists from 40 different countries to be awarded first prize in the Master's Competition. This technology has been developed through extensive laboratory testing for over 6 years in Switzerland, Germany, and Holland. Each layer in the three layered glass panel is crafted through burning the paint into the glass. The desired effect is achieved by using contrasting colors and offsetting each layer to create a three-dimensional design that comes to life, especially when hit by light.","Energy, Natural Resources, Real Estate, Sustainability",1,Zoltan Pongracz Jr.,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

In 2008 the company began developing an improved polymer, seeing an opportunity to enter this lucrative market when patent protection began expiring.

The company is now preparing to enter the market with its """"LV"""" series of polymers and associated buffer. The estimated total worldwide market for these product is  $10 to $20 million with a high margin relative to production costs.   The company founder, owner and operator is Gary Loge, Ph.D., who is largely responsible for developing the improved polymer matrices during the last six years, with initial assistance from a former polymer chemist employee.
