Eileen Koch & Company,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/eileen-koch-company,"Communications Infrastructure, Public Relations","Beverly Hills, California, United States","Is a full-service Branding, Marketing, Consulting and Public Relations Specialist.","1,595,011","Greater Los Angeles Area, West Coast, Western US",$10M to $50M,Active,1990-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,http://www.eileenkoch.com/,"Headquartered in Beverly Hills, EKC (Eileen Koch & Company INC.) is a full-service Branding, Marketing and Public Relations firm with an unparalleled 26-year history of successful and sophisticated campaigns. Under the steadfast direction of founder Eileen Koch, the careers of an amalgam of clients ranging from entertainment, fashion, beauty, athletes, restaurants, corporations, health/fitness, medical professionals, music, modeling and more, have been ignited! International in scope, but personal in nature, EKC is among the most respected publicity companies operating in Los Angeles today. EKCâs innovative methods result in increased public awareness that impact our clientâs bottom line. Our teamâs backgrounds include marketing, brand management, social media, the arts and journalism. Their combined contributions to our client roster creates an array of opportunities for individual campaigns, bringing forth completely distinctive strategies. For over 25 years, Eileen Koch & Company INC. (EKC) has been at the forefront of the publicity, branding, and marketing industries with innovative and impactful campaigns that have been highly lucrative for its clients and have set trends in promotional strategies worldwide. EKCâs wins involve entertainment superstars, top athletes, fine restaurants, household-name companies, one U.S. president, visionary entrepreneurs, and celebrity doctors and stylists. Behind the powerhouse boutique firm is Eileen Koch, a business and publicity thought leader with a profound story that galvanized her into achieving success. âI was a professional dancer with a very promising career and then found myself a single mom who had to figure out a way to survive,â the LA-based Eileen reveals. âI always say the world of PR found me.â With tenacity, charm, style and razor sharp business skills, Eileen inadvertently found herself building a PR empire one client at a time. âI remember being in deep financial trouble and walking into every beautiful store in Beverly Hills with my young daughter and giving my business card to attract more clientele,â Eileen says candidly. One early coup was celebrity hairdresser Cristophe (Cristophe Schatterman) known for cutting President Bill Clintonâs hair in Air Force One as it sat on the tarmac at LAX. Another career-making moment was discovering and managing Ukrainian beauty Milla Jovovich, then only 10 years old, propelling her from obscurity into a top model and actress virtually overnight. From these dynamic beginnings, Eileen built a company with diverse PR capabilities and cross industry clout that could strategize target-specific campaigns for clients ranging from business professionals to Hollywood heavyweights. Eileen Koch & Company INC. is unique from other firms in that every client works directly with Eileen, though she calls on her accomplished and diversely talented staff selectively to support the specific needs of each client. âI keep a boutique company deliberately. When clients hire me, they get me,â she says. Another profound distinguishing factor in EKCâs effectiveness is Eileenâs background in celebrity management. In the entertainment industry, management is a 24/7 role that encompasses being a sage and a business partner. âClients hire me for PR, but I always throw in my managerial skillsetâeveryone needs some caring and nourishment. I have the passion and talents, and I donât mind working the extra hours,â Eileen says. Eileenâs story opens with humble origins in the Bronx, New York and gains momentum when at 16 she moved with her family to balmy Los Angeles. There, enamored with Hollywoodâs pageantry and wealth of opportunities, she dove into the entertainment industry with passion and zeal. At this time, she keenly sensed her gifts as a dancerâwonderfully prefiguring her talent scout capabilitiesâand was validated on many levels when a prominent LA dance teacher not only agreed with her assessment, but also said if she put in a yearâs solid hard work she could go pro. Diligent and determined, Eileen soon rose the ranks as a gifted jazz, rock and ballet dancer, working alongside some of the biggest names in theater and television as a teen and young adult before she had to reassess her future. Looking back on her journey, Eileen offers an intriguing perspective. âWhatâs been the most meaningful thing for me is raising my daughter and saving her from a tough life,â she says. âThat was the motivation behind everything I did. From a difficult situation came a businesswoman. I didnât have people pitching in to back my business. I created this on my own to provide security and a beautiful home for my child. I made something happen. Like I always say, PR found me.â","Hardware, Sales and Marketing",1,Eileen Koch,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

With these features, family and friends have a common online space in which they can heal and remember. The site can be used to create tributes for anyone who has died, and so it is interesting to see that Respectance has a number of tributes for dead celebrities as well. With the availability of groups on the website, people can also find and connect with others who have experienced similar losses. There exist groups like ""Just Lost Mom,"" ""Iraq,"" and others so that people can heal together, offer support, and give advice. Ultimately, Respectance offers an honest service that aims to help people cope with death. Their revenue model is not based on advertising, but rather by charging money for extra services (for instance, it costs $1 to download a funeral video). As a niche social networking site, Respectance has certainly chosen to take on a unique market sector, and time will only tell if this is one that can work.","Internet Services, Media and Entertainment",2,"Richard Derks, Todd Wilkinson",11-50,2,Early Stage Venture,1750000,USD,1750000,1750000,USD,1750000,"Solid Ventures, Big Bang Ventures",2,2,,Private,,,,,,

Folio Associates, a predecessor to FolioMed, was founded in the early 1970's by two advertising executives, Leon and Patricia Wirtenberg. Recognizing a need in the medical community for a directory listing all the physicians in Massachusetts they launched the first printed Folioâs Physician Directory of Massachusetts in 1972. The original Folio directory listed physicians by name and included address and phone number, but because of the incompleteness and inaccuracy of any public records at the time, all the information had to be verified by sending individual Physician Proof Forms. And because there were several narrowly focused physician lists in the early days that concentrated on a particular medical specialty or metro area, Folio developed the approach of providing a complete census of all practicing physicians so that the customer was confident that a physician was included. Folio has maintained these two operating principles throughout its history (1) all information about physicians is verified and (2) Folio data is a comprehensive census of all practicing physicians in a state.","Data and Analytics, Health Care, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Ri Training apps allow Direct Sales Professionals to manage daily prospecting activities on any device. A 32% conversion ratio of prospects to enrollments is the core focus of Ri Training for Direct Sales Professionals and their teams. This is achieved by increasing a Direct Sales Professional's effectiveness to convert 60% of prospects to presentations, 60% of presentations to follow-ups and 90% of follow-ups to enrollments. This results in Direct Sales Professionals converting 32% of prospects to enrollments as either a customer or distributor. All systems, tools, practice and training helps improve these conversion ratios. The 3-Step Success Pattern is the system and structure that shows a Direct Sales Professional exactly what they should be doing for each phase of their business. It maps the Goals, Action Items and Time Focus for the start-up phase (approximately one month), the building phase (approximately three months) and the leader phase. The Personal Effectiveness Profile is a Skill and Knowledge Assessment that measures proficiency and competence in 50 critical skills. A report with Red, Yellow and Green bars for each of the 50 skills allows a Direct Sales Professional to identify which skills they need to work on the most to increase their effectiveness. A Learning Library mapped directly to the 50 critical skills of each individual's Personal Effectiveness Profile Report allows a user to increase knowledge and skills in the areas they need most. The Residual Income:registered: Game is a business building simulator. Just as a flight simulator allows a pilot to practice and increase skills in a safe environment, the Ri Training simulator allows Direct Sales Professionals to improve their skills in a simulated business environment. The Residual Income:registered: Game can be setup in many different ways to practice and simulate different skills or business activities to increase effectiveness.
