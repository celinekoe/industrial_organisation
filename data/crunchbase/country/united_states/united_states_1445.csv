NIFTY Souq is committed to ZERO minting costs for all artists launching NFTs on the platform, in addition to dedicated onboarding support to bring your NFT vision to life.

NFTs are unique digital files, which are provably scarce and useable across multiple applications. Like physical goods, you can do whatever you want with them! You can collect them, gift them, sell them, and even destroy them! They are digital files that are armed with all the programmable securities to allow them to become digital assets. A core part of our vision is to bring NFT and its technology to the MENA region to where users truly own this powerful brand of new digital items. Open, liquid marketplaces will help power these new economies and support artists to monetize through NFTs and digital assets. Therefore, we are working with a community of passionate users, developers, and creators to build the MENA’s first marketplace for NFTs.

When combined with the grid, they will create a hybrid power system that is cheaper, more reliable and much “greener” than the grid alone. YouSolar has the technology and business model to accelerate this transformation. Their first market is India, a country with acute power shortages that is emerging as the largest market for solar+battery systems. If you regularly need backup power and have roof space, YouSolar can provide a complete energy solution at much lower cost than electricity from a diesel generator. You will have reliable, high quality electricity with no switchover during grid outages and plenty of power when turning on appliances. Best of all, they will monitor your system 24/7 and back it up with a 5-year warranty. The worldwide market for solar systems is poised to grow exponentially. India is the hotspot. In July 2015 India announced a goal of 40 GW of power from rooftop solar by 2022 (equivalent to 10 million systems). However, two big challenges must be overcome: How to integrate these systems with the grid, and how to finance them. YouSolar’s solar+battery systems and secure leasing model are the answers. Thanks to this proprietary intelligence, the YouSolar system uses nearly all the solar energy generated by the solar array and, thus, does not have to be “net metered”. The system takes power from the grid, but never sends power to the grid. So, there is no need to get a permit from the utility. YouSolar’s system can remain functioning at all times, unlike net metered systems which must shut down during power cuts (for safety). Being available during power cuts and requiring no permits are big advantages in markets like India.","Energy, Natural Resources, Sustainability",1,Arnold Leitner,1-10,4,,4029000,USD,4029000,4029000,USD,4029000,"Cleantech Open, Meyer Global Management, Keiretsu Forum Northwest",,3,,Private,,,,,,
