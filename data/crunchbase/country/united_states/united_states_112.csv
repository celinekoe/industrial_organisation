But when we started comparing notes from one website to the next, we found the endless possibilities challenging instead of helpful. So we started thinking, why should brides have to open multiple browsers when one website could provide a quick and easy shopping and planning experience all in one? Let’s face it; in this economy we could all use a break. That’s why we created Wedding Stub.  This is a great opportunity for brides, grooms, and vendors alike to find exactly what it is they are looking for.  Wedding Stub is a premier website that displays daily deals from hundreds of New York City vendors who cater to the wedding industry and couples things to do. Offering one-stop shopping on bridal gowns, tuxedos, restaurants, catering halls, florists, centerpieces, spa treatments, and so much more, www.weddingstub.com is sure to become the nation’s fastest growing wedding website for the newly engaged and recently betrothed.   Catering exclusively to the wedding industry and couples things to do, we provide our clients the products, services, and special offers they have come to expect from other leading discount websites.   Brides can build their own website, read articles on wedding related tips, search for vendors, and save 50-60% off on their wedding day needs. Vendors can upload photos, create their own deals using the state of the art vendor dashboard and track all deals that are sold using the Quick Response Code tracking system on their mobile device. With this technology, they can also instantly track customers who used the deal they purchased.  In addition, Wedding Stub will soon launch the Vendor Spotlight feature to post interviews of makeup artists, photographers, caterers and others whose services are a must have in the wedding industry. In a short period of time, Wedding Stub has enjoyed significant success and received glowing reviews. Our team would like to thank Tech Crunch as we continue to make headway in wedding circles throughout the country.",Commerce and Shopping,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The MonkeyBusinessâ„¢ Network adds a missing element to typical e-commerce; it integrates the social aspect of business that exists in brick-and-mortar shopping. One thing that MonkeyBusinessâ„¢ leverages is the value of knowing companies more intimately. This major obstacle for online commerce has existed for years. Consumers feel that online salesmen act like robots, emotionless interfaces of information with only one goal: to complete trade transactions. This may work fine for certain types of mass-produced or reliable products or automated services, but it does not account for a vast majority of products, services, events, media and other commodities where the seller really must add a personal sense of value-added that must be conveyed in order to finalize a transaction and deliver a service. This particular problem of conveying seller pathos (an emotional connection from buyer to seller) can hardly be established with just a numerical seller reputation score, and not just a online retail environment. But online pathos can be established easily, such as in social networks and dating websites, chatrooms, discussion-boards in any online community. Is seller pathos important for business? Absolutely, if you happen to be like the vast majority of the world who makes a living selling or making something other than mass-produced products and or automated information services. The MonkeyBusinessâ„¢ Network is not just an auctionhouse or a huge product catalog; it is its own trading ecosystem. Imagine a shopping mall where you don't have to spend any money to spend time at, and are not pressured to ask questions to merchants regarding only specific products. A shopping mall where you can set up a storefront for your own products and services without any monetary investment to the mall itself. A shopping mall where you don't even have to buy anything or sell anything in order to belong or have meaningful relationships or discussions. A shopping mall where you can be yourself in, and have friends that aren't just you're friends because of what's in your wallet. Belonging to the network is more than buying, selling, producing, and marketing. Life is more than those things, so why shouldn't shopping be more than those things, when the purpose of shopping is generally to improve one's life? This type of shopping mall is the future of e-commerce; a social network marketplace. Not just a marketplace; not just a social network. It's the synergistic combination of both environments together that propels its effectiveness. And once you add the ability to earn money by promoting other peoples products, it becomes a social marketplace where everyone can be involved on a profitable level-- and the distinctions between social class dissolve, since any seller can buy, any buyer can sell, anyone can trade, and anyone can sell anything that sellers want help selling. So many opportunities are available on this type of network that you don't have to sell things just to make money; you can choose only products you believe in, and support only sellers that you appreciate. In a social network marketplace, nobody necessarily thinks of you as one type of actor and nobody is confined to just one role, because everyone can play all of the roles, and is encouraged to do so. Isn't this more a model of how all trade really works, and how the economy regulates itself? Or is this just a new age fantasy? U4EA Networks, Inc. thinks this not a fantasy; it is the best model for an online marketplace that ever existed, and so today they are turning this model into an online reality.","Commerce and Shopping, Internet Services, Software",,,1-10,1,Seed,30000,USD,30000,30000,USD,30000,,,,,Private,,,,,,
