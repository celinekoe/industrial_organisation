Whether it was moving to a new country, or to a new building, being a freshman in college or starting a new job. The first thing we want to know is people around us, and to understand what’s around us, from places, attractions, or any points of interests. We will lookup the new spot and try to see it’s history and we will try to relate and to acclimate. From the essence of new beginnings, a new project named Spots has started, to help those who are looking for fresh starts. Spots - an AI powered Location based social network, was built on the concept of going out, meeting people, having fun, and remembering all those moments. When you open the app, you can see other users around you, some you already know and others you don’t, you can connect with them and share some of your moments as well. Every post on Spots can be shared with friends and can be pinned in the location where it was taken, and people will find it when they pass by. There’s no need to ask your friends to send you a photo from your birthday anymore, you can simply open the app and access all the photos that were taken on your birthday! Spots also provides an easy access to places around you, and let’s you post in those places for your friends to find when they are around. And lastly, Spots gives you a sneak peak into the future, by showing you what AI will see when it looks at you, so when you post a picture look it up in your Spots feed, and see what the smart system has seen in it.","Community and Lifestyle, Data and Analytics, Internet Services, Mobile, Navigation and Mapping, Platforms, Software",2,"Aya Ibrahim, Mamdouh Alramadan",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
