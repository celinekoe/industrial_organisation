Rather  than take a one-size-fits-all approach, StopLift has developed targeted applications to address the specific needs of retailers from different sectors, including general merchandise, grocery, and specialty retail.   StopLift grew out of a Harvard Business School field study on Retail Loss Prevention entitled “Project StopLift”.  One of the study’s major findings was that, while CCTV is the most widespread of all loss prevention technologies, it is often the most underutilized--it is just too expensive and time-consuming for humans to monitor or review video comprehensively.   With engineering talent and computer vision research insights from MIT, the Project StopLift team realized that video recognition could be used to automate and, thus, make possible the comprehensive examination of surveillance video.","Administrative Services, Commerce and Shopping, Data and Analytics, Hardware, Information Technology, Media and Entertainment, Privacy and Security, Science and Engineering, Software, Video",1,Malay Kundu,51-100,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The need for a mobile service was evident in the quickly expanding transportation and distribution industry in the greater New York City area. Many spawning companies had growing truck fleets that all needed cleaning, and the original mobile truck washing idea took off and grew rapidly through the 70's and continued to increase into the 80's. FLEETWASH was largely a family-run business, driven by innovation, hard work and long hours.
