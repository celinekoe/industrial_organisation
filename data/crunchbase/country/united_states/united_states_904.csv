In 2013, we tried to buy special purpose processors for a passion project. They were only sold in lots of 1000. After scouring the internet for a solution, we discovered that there was no secure platform for collectively purchasing existing products with minimum order restrictions. Getting a group together for a bulk purchase was a difficult and risky proposition, and crowdfunding platforms were no help. Traditional crowdfunding sites are great. But, they neglect independent buyers who need to team up with other buyers around the world to get bulk pricing discounts and access components, end user products, and services that have high minimum order quantities. So, we set out to fill this gap. We created GroupGets to provide an intuitive group buying platform where professionals and enthusiasts can participate in collective purchasing as easily as they buy anything else online, and get rewarded for creating group buys and helping others get around minimum order requirements. No Vaporware. No year-long shipping delays. Just simple, secure group buying. GroupGets is where the rest of us—the makers, hobbyists, DIY engineers, crafters, artists, small businesses, and deal seekers—get together and hack minimum order restrictions.","Commerce and Shopping, Financial Services, Hardware",3,"Kurt Kiefer, Ronald Justin, Sashi Ono",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
