They have a wide range of skill sets in their membership and you’re likely to find someone who can talk about most any technical concept with you in a meaningful way. They are a physical space where you can come, 24/7 as a member, and have access to wide array of equipment you are not very likely to have at home. Plus, there are folks around the space that can give you tips and pointers on operating that equipment effectively. They will train you to use the equipment, and ask that you do the same for others. They aim to foster a community of makers by providing an environment in terms of people, equipment and space that supports the creative process and personal growth. Modern software, the Internet and economies of scale have all come together to allow ordinary people with a little bit of know-how to begin blurring the lines between manufacturer and consumer. With some effort and the help of a growing community of makers it is possible for a lone individual to make things of amazing quality and functionality. Makerspaces that act as hubs for the maker community are popping up all over the world.
