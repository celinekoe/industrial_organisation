Superior Japanese matcha looks and tastes great - brilliantly green, sweet, with a rich, complex and satisfying flavor. Our first sip. On a fateful trip to Japan, we first tasted this wonderful emerald green elixir. We liked matcha so much that we wanted to recreate the experience at home and drink it regularly. At first, we had to bring small tins of it back from Japan, because it was not available here. We also brought back tea bowls and bamboo measuring scoops and whisks. Soon we were in the habit of drinking a morning bowl of matcha and turning friends onto it. Gradually, we learned more about this rare and highly prized form of green tea: how it is cultivated and processed, the distinction among different grades, how to recognize the best matcha. We've become so excited about the unique and amazing benefits of matcha we decided to form a company to identify, import, and provide really great matcha tea!","Food and Beverage, Health Care",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

In 2005, founder Jason Fiber was recruited by Jac Holzman and The Warner Music Group to found and launch the first “online” record label called Cordless Recordings, where he signed the Boston-based synthpop band Freezepop. After the label merged with another company Fiber departed and was asked by Freezepop to manage them. After a bit of convincing he founded the management/booking/consulting company known today as Superfecta Entertainment. Superfecta has produced several successful tours, including multiple world tours (including several runs for Combichrist as support for Rammstein) as well as three Brazilian tours for Information Society. Superfecta specializes in taking small, but motivated, artists and growing their careers.
