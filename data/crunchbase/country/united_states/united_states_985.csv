An enhanced understanding of the potential consequences that a particular technology may produce enables enterprise IT customers to implement effective measures at the onset as opposed to after-the-fact. TestBed provides guidance at the very beginning of the technology acquisition process. TestBed establishes the priorities and requirements of the client, identifies available technology products, builds and maintains a virtual test environment for those products, records both the positive and negative potential each product poses to the client, and delivers an implementation roadmap for the selected technology.  What makes TestBed unique, however, is the focus on efficiency and rapid testing. By focusing on high-level goals and basic requirements, the research and testing process is streamlined.

CheapCup® is a mobile app for purchasing alcoholic beverages.","2,621,247","Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",$1M to $10M,Active,2014-06-01,day,,,,,For Profit,http://www.cheapcup.com,"CheapCup® is the most advanced and robust mobile marketing and payments platform in the bar and restaurant industry.  The endorsement of your brand is critical in today’s competitive landscape, and a better understanding of what your customers purchase and what your customers share with their friends and social media contacts helps you adapt to what your target audience craves most. Our powerful app will help keep your competitors at bay by rewarding your consumers to endorse your brand immediately after every purchase.  Our marketing platform also serves as a point-of-sale system, driving consumers to purchase your marketed offers directly through their mobile phones.  Our seamless technology, combined with a powerful backend to manage, market, and handle the processing of each drink special purchased through the app not only helps drive sales but provides you with key performance indicators of each offer and the demographics of your customer base. Here are some of the features of the CheapCup® Platform and how they can benefit your brand: Marketing & Social Media:  We empower your brand with social drinkers and bar patrons willing to endorse your establishment and drink specials.  Using a proprietary built-in social media sharing program, consumers are rewarded for sharing the details of your establishment and any drink special with the click of a button.  As more local consumers learn about your establishment and drink specials, you can expect more consumers to frequent your establishment over time.  We turn your consumer purchases into direct, effortless and powerful marketing campaigns designed to reward you for simply providing delicious beverages available for a special, exclusive price via the CheapCup® App. Backend Management:  No one understands your brand better than you.  That’s why the CheapCup® Platform grants you full control of your CheapCup® Drink Specials Store Front via a backend system that includes media management, social media integration and business information that you want to convey to your consumers in real-time. Payments System:  Unlike other apps which simply allow consumers to sign up and use coupons to make their purchases, the CheapCup® App provides a secure, lightning fast payment for all your marketing offers without connecting to an external POS system.  Our app saves time vs. using standard credit card, cash, gift card or any other payment method that you accept. Inventory & Financials:  The most important details of each and every transaction are captured in real time including date and time stamp, transaction ID, item purchased, quantity purchased, and amount spent.  You’ll be able to effortlessly see your gross and net revenue, gratuities, and the sales details of each of your offers and by any time period.  We also track the sales and gratuities of each of your employees and bartenders. Data Analytics:  Curious to see who is patronizing your establishment and using our app to purchase drink specials?   Our app not only tracks the performance history of your offers, but it also tracks age and gender demographics of your customers as well as how much they spend on drinks.  With a Premium Analytics Upgrade*, you’ll be provided with advanced analytics including trend analysis, sales projections, social media share tracking, and bar and restaurant rankings within your city.
