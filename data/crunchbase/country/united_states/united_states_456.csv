However, we strongly believe that there is an opportunity to rethink this matter. Yornest offers a fresh approach to how mass communication is handled for member-based communities. Say goodbye to the old-fashioned, one-size-fits-all approach and embrace a new era of streamlined, efficient, and engaging communication. Traditional SMS & email channels for member-based communities is a one-sided conversation that often inundates users with generic messages, leaving them feeling disconnected and bombarded. At Yornest, we believe in a more meaningful approach. Our innovative community communication app empowers community managers to transform SMS & emails marketing into a two-way dialogue. Imagine sending SMS or email alerts that not only convey your message but also drive the recipients to engage in a community feed where they can discuss, ask questions, and share their thoughts in real-time. It's time to bid farewell to one-way SMS & email blasts and embrace a more interactive and engaging communication method that fosters genuine connections. At Yornest, we deeply appreciate that the vitality of any community is intricately linked to the quality of its interactions and conversations. This profound understanding has led us to revolutionize the way community managers harness the potential of SMS and email channels as a means of communication, seamlessly integrating them into a dynamic community feed. Unlike traditional approaches, our community feed transcends being a mere one-way communication tool; it serves as the pulsating epicenter of engagement. Our innovative platform empowers users to leverage posts from the feed as text alerts or emails, effectively transforming every interaction into an opportunity for fostering meaningful dialogue. In doing so, we are dismantling the longstanding barriers that have separated marketing from community engagement.","Apps, Software",2,"Michael Brizendine, Shaq Noor",1-10,1,Seed,1000000,USD,1000000,1000000,USD,1000000,"Keyhorse Capital (KSTC), Garrett French",1,2,,Private,,,,,,
