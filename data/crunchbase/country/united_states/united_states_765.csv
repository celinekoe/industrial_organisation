Conway's history dates back to the early 1900's when the Heineman brothers began to deal in gourmet meats and poultry. Conway's founder, Albert P. Heineman, started working full time with his father ""Ike"" at the age of 13. Sometime later, Mr. Conway approached the Heineman's to invest in his vegetable oil business. Ike Heineman subsequently bought out Mr. Conway, keeping the Conway name, and began importing oil from France and the Philippines. Conway entered the mayonnaise business through the persistence and help of a hotel chef. He encouraged Conway to make a fine mayonnaise using only the yolk. Soon Conway received requests from other hotel and restaurant Chefs asking them to manufacture their dressings. From there, Conway began developing its own dressings, as well as making recipes provided by Chefs and Chain Accounts. Conway is proud to say that it uses no fillers in its product line. Conway uses oil levels that are higher than the government standards. These levels give the dressings a smooth texture and enable the dressing to cling well to the salad. Conway has a strict code on the quality of spices and raw materials it receives for production. Variations in any one spice can affect a dressing. Conway follows strict guidelines on all spices, resulting in extremely consistent products. Consistency is important to any successful foodservice operation. Conway guarantees that dressing served in a hotel in Boston will be the same as in Seattle. Conway strives for, and achieves, this consistency.","Food and Beverage, Manufacturing",1,Gregg Heineman,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

AEi Systems is most well known for its analysis of space-bound and other industrial power supplies and power systems -- especially those that must operate reliably under extreme conditions (such as radiation, magnetic fields, heat, and the like) and yet also keep within size and weight limitations. AEi Systems is the world leader in Worst Case Circuit Analysis (WCCA) and failure and reliability analysis for space-bound DC-DC converters. The company also acts as a supplier of highly specialized radiation-hardened power supplies and related power system circuitry. The company was founded in 2002, and its predecessor, Analytical Engineering, Inc., was founded in 1995.  The company has four, inter-related business lines: * Analysis: Worst Case Circuit Analysis (WCCA) and failure and reliability analyses. * SPICE Modeling: Modeling of complex ICs for major manufacturers and to support AEi Systems analysis and design work. * Software: Sale of licensed copies of (i) the company's Power IC Model Library for PSpice, and (ii) certain WCCA templates and tables. * Design: Design and licensing or sale of space-bound and other industrial power supplies and related power system circuitry. Noteworthy achievements and facts: * Motorola University's ""six sigma class"" on worst case analysis was created by AEi Systems * The failing design of the LVPS power supply for the Atlas Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN (the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator) was revised and upgraded by AEi Systems * Most SPICE models for Power ICs that electrical engineers find on the Internet were created by AEi Systems, including those found on the websites of ON Semiconductor and Texas Instruments and those used via National Semiconductor's online Webench tool * AEi Systems analyzed the power buss for the International Space Station Defense and Aerospace Projects AEi Systems has been involved in the development and analysis of some of the most sophisticated and technically challenging power systems in the world, both in the space and defense arena and also with respect to commercial and industrial applications. The company has provided computer simulation models and worst case circuit analysis on most projects. Many projects are ""dark"" but among the company's publicly-known projects are: BSAT, CMIS, Globalstar, GMI, Goes, GPS, HS-702, Intellsat, Juno, MCI, Milstar, MSV, MUOS. NPOESS, Omegasat, P1196, P-81, SMMA, SMU, Spaceway, Tempo, Virgo, XPC Commercial and Scientific Projects  AEi Systems' power supply analysis and design expertise has also been sought for commercial and industrial projects not involving space or defense. For example, AEi Systems worked on the following projects (we can name): The upgrading and revision of the failing design of the LVPS power supply for the Atlas Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN (the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator that ""uncovered"" the Higgs Boson) Darwin (Schilling Robotics), a 100kW Remotely Operated underwater Vehicle (ROV) that operates underneath the North Sea under 17 kPSI at over 6 kM; and  Commercial projects for Bosch, DeLL and EMC. SPICE Modeling AEi Systems provides SPICE models to many major IC manufacturers, including Texas Instruments, ON Semiconductor and National Semiconductor. Many can be seen on (and downloaded from) their websites.  Since 2005, this business unit has produced and distributed the Power IC Model Library for PSpice, which is distributed by Cadence's sole North American distributor (EMA-EDA) in the United States and Canada, and by other major distributors in Asia and Europe.",Science and Engineering,4,"Charles Hymowitz, Lee Weinberg, Steve Sandler, Steven Sandler",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

This fact remains true today. Banks, and other business lenders, have cumbersome lending processes that take weeks (if not longer) to process and they typically want to see a business plan, tax returns and personal financial statements. The approval rate to small business from traditional lending institutions is extremely low; and typically those that are approved are required to pledge their personal collateral (including their homes!) as a condition to funding. They knew there had to be a better way. They are business people that understand your need for cash is a reality of doing business. But unlike banks, the reason you need the cash is not their concern, nor is your personal balance sheet. Their primary concern is enabling you to access the value of your sales and cash flow in the most optimized manner possible, and get you the cash you need today! At Merchant Capital Source you will receive a finance solution that fits your unique business needs.
