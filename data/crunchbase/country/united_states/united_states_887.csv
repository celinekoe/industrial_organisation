More specifically, Outski is a unique, online social platform on which people may realize their travel plans and dreams; it gives consumers an easy, and effective way to get from “we ought to do this” to actually doing it.   Outski’s technology allows consumers to plan, budget, and research, as well as the book, save and pay for travel, goods, and services before and during their trip. They can invite, share, collaborate, and coordinate their travel with as many friends and family as they desire.  Since no other site provides a way for consumers to plan, socialize, save, book, and pay for travel, Outski is unique in the marketplace. Outski’s financial component allows consumers to establish a Vacation Savings Account (“VSA”) held in trust by a Financial Services Partner, and when the user is ready to book travel or use their saved funds, they are loaded onto their Visa or Discover branded Travel Savings Card that they can use while traveling.  Along with its online platform, Outski has developed a unique program called 401(play)TM that provides a B2B solution that helps employers to increase worker productivity, efficiency, health, and wellness.  Used in conjunction with a VSA, this program is marketed directly to businesses as part of its benefits program.  Employees are able to set aside a portion of each paycheck into their VSA using this program to pay for future travel. Millennials aged between 18 and 36 will initially be targeted since many enjoy travel, but lack the financial means to instantaneously book travel.   There are 80 million Millenials representing 25% of the U.S. population and having more than $200 billion in annual buying power.

The result is easy, low cost adoption, and a “perpetual” revenue model based on usage fee for Summerhill.  This also solves the “bulk” of biomass problem and associated transportation issues Summerhill possesses the key to the symbiotic relationship between a deep understanding of the agricultural market and economic viability of powdered fuels in the biomass market. Safe and reliable. Waste and byproducts derived from materials such as Alfalfa, Cane, Citrus, Corn, Flax, Manure, Sewage, Sorghum, Switchgrass, and Wood can be leveraged to create storable fuel and energy. Powdered biomass can enhance efficiency of cellulose to ethanol and diodigester processes by using byproduct for heat recovery in operations. Further, it is well documented across many industries to be easily and safely transported. Efficiency: Summerhill methods recover high percentages of energy stored in biomass without use of complex fermentation processes, fertilizer, food crops, or cultivated land.  The Summerhill process is easily inserted in the farm/processor/storage hub model that is inherent to agriculture. While most economic commercialization timelines for cleantech and green technology are expected to be 15-20 years, investors, the U.S. government  and affiliates would like to see a reduced timeline of to three to five years.  Since Summerhill leverages existing assets and ways of doing business, the company is confident it can achieve commercialization with an attractive ROI on a three to five year schedule.

Through this strategic partnership with SAFE, Mayo Clinic is committed to applying its accumulated knowledge, world-class clinical expertise, and general standard of excellence to empowering billions of patients worldwide with access to quality routine care. Core to realizing its mission is the Company’s Digital Health and Connected Diagnostics Platform that enables rapid implementation of specialized digital healthcare applications designed to improve access to affordable treatment of common medical conditions, efficient chronic disease management, and auditable remote patient monitoring (the “Platform”). Designed by the former Chief Architect of the CDC, the Platform combines virtualized provider services, AI-enabled care automation, electronic patient record interoperability, public health reporting, and remote point-of-care diagnostics to enable companies and world governments to improve healthcare outcomes and reduce delivery costs at population scale. Building on exclusive technology licenses from Columbia University, the Company has developed an integrated Connected Diagnostics System (“CDS”), which completes the connected care loop by enabling self-collection and real-time digital assessment of rapid diagnostic tests outside of the point of care, coupled with a proprietary system for enabling crowdsourced telehealth provider services at the speed and scale required for population-scale adoption. The CDS dramatically extends current telehealth capabilities and will enable a wide range of new remote patient care/monitoring applications.SAFE is currently implementing an IRB study in collaboration with Mayo Clinic and Arizona State University (“ASU”) designed with guidance from the FDA to secure EUA clearance for home (outside lab) use of multiple LFIA-platform COVID-19 rapid antigen and antibody tests.","Health Care, Information Technology",1,Ken Mayer,101-250,1,,,,,,USD,,"Particular Ventures, Three Bridges Private Capital",1,2,,Private,,,,,,
