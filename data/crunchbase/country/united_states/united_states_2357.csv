I'm Rose Szwed --dedicated to making your time aboard a Step on Bus a fact-filled, fun-filled, unforgettable memory. I know my stuff because I spend the time researching at libraries & traveling to destinations so I know what is around every corner.... and how many steps from here to there & cool stuff you'll see in between. Examples? Take one of the favorites of our many popular tours, our excursion into the world of Amish traditions and culture -- the simple yet delicious farm dining and a horse-and-carriage way of life in a time that's not quite gone -- but it changes constantly. Or can go back to the long-gone times of Prohibition, to the River of Rum, as illegal booze came onto our shores, and into speakeasies throughout the Midwest -- and sometimes in a hail of bullets -- and where you can actually visit a legal speakeasy, still in existence today.  My background as a copy writer and Director of Public Relations has certainly helped tell accurate and fascinating stories. Though no Cecile D. DeMille, my cheesy DVDs help tell the rest of the story. Plus, I'm addicted to historic sites, juxtaposing new and old buildings, and tossing in a reenactor to tell the rest of the story.  And of course, I can't do all this fun stuff alone, there are the knowledgeable tour planners, the cracker jack designer, the copywriter who edited the Bible along with food and refreshment planners to provide snacks and beverages en route; entertainment people who provide fun and games, with prizes to help you enjoy yourself all the way there and back; plus careful, courteous and friendly drivers to make the miles go by safely and comfortably. So come on. Let's chat. Toss me an idea or two and watch what I can do with it. Step aboard a Step On Bus tour. It's the only way to go!",Travel and Tourism,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
