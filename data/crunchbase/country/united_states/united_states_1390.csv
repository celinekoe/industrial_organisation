Fire feeds their soul and warms their spirit. So we’ve made it their mission to bring you nature-inspired products that make it easy to nestle up to a cozy fire, in the fireplace or around the campfire, with a simple strike of a match. Their story begins in 1980, when their team developed its first Firestarter products. Knowing that starting a fire was often the greatest challenge, making the task simple—and fast—seemed a great place to bring fresh ideas. Not only did They create an easy way to start a fire using all-natural American hardwood sawdust, but They also found a way to utilize a previously unused resource. Inspiration and momentum really began to percolate when They saw coffee houses popping up around the country, yielding another previously unused resource: coffee grounds. The aroma of brewed coffee is nirvana, so why not bring two great experiences—gathering around a hearth and the smell of fresh coffee—into one? In 1999 the Java-Log® Firelog was born. And just four years later it was named one of TIME® magazine’s Best Inventions of the Year. Innovation didn’t stop there. A source of beauty and joy, fire delights the senses with its crackling notes and rich, vibrant hues. Inspired by this realization, their Cracklelog® and ColorCrackle® offerings were introduced, doubly enhancing the evocative pleasures of a good fire.","Commerce and Shopping, Community and Lifestyle, Food and Beverage, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment",,,,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

My wife, Janet, and I started this business for several reasons.  As a long time investor in the stock markets and as someone who has always followed global finance and politics, the reasons for owning gold and silver started to become quite clear to me.  I started buying gold and silver seven years ago and continue to do so today. While reading one of the many gold articles one night on my computer, Janet walked by me and said â€œall you do is read about gold, silver and the politics surrounding them, why don't you start your own companyâ€.  After much thought, we decided to move forward with that idea.  Our goal from the beginning has been  two fold; we wanted to be able to deliver a professional looking website that showed our current buy and sell prices for our products  and we also wanted a physical presence in the form of an actual store location.  From my personal buying experiences, I always felt more comfortable buying from a company that had an actual store location instead of a company that was strictly internet based and only had a mailing address.  We have accomplished this by opening our first store in Del Mar, California.  If you live or are visiting  the Southern California area we invite you to visit our store in Del Mar.  I also would invite any comments or feedback regarding our website from my fellow gold and silver buyers. You can email me directly at mark@libertycpm.com or you can call during business hours.   We strive to offer you the best prices and a level of service that is unsurpassed so your input is greatly appreciated.
