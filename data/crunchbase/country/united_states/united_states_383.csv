Automotive accidents are often caused by conditions like ice or strong winds, conditions that are nobody’s fault. Unfortunately, even more accidents are caused by negligence. When an individual has acted in a negligent matter, it is only right that the victims of their negligence are able to seek compensation for what they’ve experienced. That’s what personal injury lawyers at Osborne Law Firm, P.C., believe and have been fighting to uphold for over twenty years.Based in Charlotte, North Carolina, Osborne Law Firm, P.C., understands that personal injuries are serious business. Motorcycle and truck accidents in particular often result in lifelong medical struggles or even wrongful death. But accidents aren’t always as extreme as an 18 wheeler crashing into a car. Slip and fall accidents may seem minor in comparison but they can be just as deadly. Similarly, product liability cases are prone to injuries that leave the victims suffering for years.No matter how you were injured, Osborne Law Firm, P.C., understands that it isn’t right for victims to be forced to suffer through the financial burden associated with their injuries. When an accident is caused by somebody’s negligence, the negligent party should be the one that has to pay for it. After all, they are the one who is responsible for the accident occurring in the first place. It doesn’t matter whether you slipped and fell because of a failure to maintain a premise or whether you were involved in a plane crash, if it wasn’t your fault then the financial burden shouldn’t rest on your shoulders but on the shoulders of the negligent party.",,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
