This service will offer a wide selection of TV series, movies, cartoons, and documentaries, and aims to compete with the largest platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+, etc. To achieve this project, the Madison Channel team has surrounded itself with experts in entertainment and business, such as Claudius Erhardy, who formerly worked at Disney, where he was director of France, and Benelux. To differentiate itself from its rivals, Madison Channel states it will create its own programs that it will produce with EPP, the production company that is also part of the Mason Ewing Corp. group. These exclusive programs will feature the Baby Madison mascot, his friends, and a unique universe, which includes fantasy stories, children's movies, and epic series. There will also be films and TV series, unrelated to the baby hero, which has already been written and is ready to be filmed. In addition, Madison Channel announces that it has many rare and unusual objects that will be part of the decor in its future film productions. The project's founder, Mason Ewing, who is also the CEO of Mason Ewing Corporation, says that Madison Channel will be equipped with an innovative feature never before seen in video-on-demand services that will be a revolution for its users. Moreover, the American streaming service intends to work closely with the African continent.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment, Video",0,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
