I have a huge business back ground working in the telecommunications space. I was blessed with the opportunity to work with individual business owners that sold carrier services. Loved this industry so much I stayed in it for 15 years. Working in this space actually gave me more opportunities to use my graphic design skills, but also have a better understanding how a small business works. Understanding what marketing works/ doesn’t work, how to think outside of the box with small budgets, and focus on the businesses needs to successfully grow. Marketing is so important, but has to be done right.   I studied at Northern Kentucky University with a BA in Graphic Design and Minor in Marketing. NKU  had great teachers that  worked for some of the best marketing firms in the US, like LPK.  In 1999 I was given the opportunity to work at GTE Wireless in Cincinnati Oh. Shortly in 2000 GTE Wireless merged to form Verizon Wireless. Our Market was sold to T-Mobile where I was given the opportunity for a promotion as a Territory Representative. This position allowed me to work with dealer principals that sold T-Mobile services. My key responsibilities were to work side by side with the owners to grow their business through training and marketing. This is where I was able to use my Graphic Design back ground developing bill boards on the major highways, t-shirts for give aways, ads on movie theatre screens, package design, fliers, brochures, even kiosk designs. Wireless Dealers were given co-op money from the wireless carriers so this gave me so much opportunity with large budgets! I was able to experiment with what worked and what was a waste of time. To this day my goal is to successful use small businesses money effectively where you are able to receive an ROI on your advertising ideas.","Advertising, Mobile, Other, Professional Services, Sales and Marketing",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Our goal is two-fold: to create open a forum of discussion about what William Gibson calls “the very finest fossils of the pre-digital age” and to bring our own experiences and intellect to bear on what, thus far, has been a closed cabal of high-end wristwatch manufacturers ($21,000 bling-bling anyone?) and, to some extent, high-end watch consumers who value flash over elegence and ultility. Why do I love wristwatches and where did my particular, and very recent, obsession begin to surface? Mechanical watches were the high tech of their age. The sheer complexity of involved in creating a small, perfectly functioning timepiece in a case the size of a few quarters stacked is amazing on many levels. To engineer, and eventually collect, a fine timepiece or even one that wouldn’t normally be considered a “quality” piece requires precision, intelligence, and a flair for the somewhat quixotic. Again, to quote Gibson’s excellent essay, My Obsession, “They’re pointless in a peculiarly needful way; they’re comforting precisely because they require tending.” Watches are one of the few things we have in common with the generations that came before us. Since the 16th century, men and women around the world have carried watches. Now, as cell phones, PDAs, computers, and media players weigh us down and trudge through an information society, many of the things we carry would be considered witchcraft during the time of Abraham-Louis Perrelet, who invented the of the perpetual self-winding watch in 1770. But our watches, small, self-contained, and perfect, would be instantly recognizable. The world has changed, but seconds still fold into minutes and these fold into hours. I founded WristWatchReview in 2004 and it is one of the oldest and most established watch blogs on the Internet.

The first trend was the rise in availability of WiFi across higher education campuses; the second was the rapid adoption of smart phone and tablet devices by students and adult learners; and the third was the increase in large, hybrid and distance learning classroom configurations at most higher educational institutions. Today this foresight has become reality, as WiFi is available in virtually every classroom, over 50% of course material today is delivered outside the physical classroom for classes of all sizes and configurations, and there is near ubiquity for student ownership of at least one smart device. In addition to rapid technology transitions in the classroom, there is competitive pressure to implement state-of-the-art instructional technology at every university to address the demands of today’s digitally savvy students. Students do not want to sit quietly in lectures in any sized classroom. Instead they want to learn by exploring and actively engaging with instructors and peer students. Via Response was launched specifically to enable instructors to engage today’s tech savvy, interactive students with a state-of-the-art student engagement platform that leverages technologies that are the norm in today’s digital classrooms.
