We invest in teams we believe in and our experience suggests that finding good founding teams and leaving them in place tends to produce higher returns overall.  As a corollary, we resist shackling a company to its original business model. Businesses really do evolve over time and changing models in the early years is anything but a sign of weakness. We do not expect that the first business model for a company will be the final or best business model and do not see evolution as a negative. The most powerful minds are the ones that can be changed.  We believe that substantially all of our investments should be directed to companies with an audacious vision seeking enormous markets. So, we will continue to invest in very talented entrepreneurs who are pursuing ambitious, challenging tasks. We will treat them with respect and hope for the best.","Financial Services, Lending and Investments",1,Walter Kortschak,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The sheets are knit using premium materials, from manmade fibers to all-natural Tencel fiber that is created from wood pulp. The sheets help regulate body temperature by wicking moisture away from the body, creating a cool and dry sleep environment. The product lineup provides a choice of products that enhance the comfort of your current bed by being totally invisible, and supplying you with all the benefits mentioned above. The MOTIVATE Collection’s REM-Fit Active line of products are Sleep and Activity trackers, which focus on analyzing sleep and activity, not just showing your number of steps or time slept. Using our exclusive algorithms for SleepPoints, ActivePoints and the 360 LifeScore, REM-Fit Active provides you with a score based on the efficiency and effectiveness of both your sleep and activity combined. By focusing on both activity and the sleep needed for recovery, REM-Fit Active is an exciting way for you, no matter what fitness level, to track your sleep and activity and contribute to living a healthy lifestyle.","Community and Lifestyle, Consumer Goods, Other",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
