While competitors like Pandora create complex algorithms to generate song lists, Radical is programmed by hand, by passionate music experts. With 30 million tracks at your disposal and a powerful yet user-friendly design, no other service creates an endless stream of songs that so accurately reflects your musical taste. Radical also offers RadCasting - unique, personal broadcasting with synchronous music sharing and discovery - where users can broadcast and share their stations with any other user, on mobile or desktop.   Radical, free and commercial-free for as long as you make it possible.   A corporation with a conscience, Radical.FM compensates artists, composers, and labels for all the music streamed. Yet the company chooses to offer the ad-free service on a ‘Pay What You Can’ donation basis because Radical believes in a quality musical experience devoid of commercials, even for the unemployed and working poor. Radical continues a two-decade tradition of pushing the boundaries of online radio. Tracing its roots back to Tomsradio.com (a Swedish streaming music service that helped inspire Spotify), as well as Bandit Radio (Sweden’s biggest rock radio station, one of the first broadcast radio stations to simulcast over the internet in 1994), Radical’s broadcast radio roots helped inspire its uniquely effective interface. Unlike typical tech and algorithm-heavy online radio services, Radical.FM is programmed by hand, by human beings. With a powerful yet intuitive design, no other service allows such a high degree of control over an endless stream of music.","Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio, Video",1,Thomas McAlevey,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Qbit's codec is a mathematically lossless, flexible, content-specific and HD-oriented software package which enables faster delivery, minimizes storage volumes and increases throughput of high fidelity content for applications in the entertainment, medical, defense and web markets. Qbit envisions an entirely new paradigm in data storage and transmission, one that calls upon the most recent advances across the spectrum of scientific disciplines to produce some truly ground breaking technologies. Qbit's highly talented research team developed novel mathematical algorithms that break away from the typical approaches used in the rest of the data compression field. In addition, the Qbit research team is adopting a more cognitive, computational approach that will develop smarter systems that will evolve the coding schemes and the patterns they are seeking and will also learn from prior experience. As such, these systems can be used for information densification of any type of data. The first short-term outcome of this research is a series of CODEC algorithms, in software and hardware configurations, that are being brought to market now. The Qbit approach takes advantage of inherent probability distributions in digital data, combined with transformations from different mathematical spaces, to perform compression in a lossless, reversible manner.","Privacy and Security, Software",1,Michael Bläsi,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
