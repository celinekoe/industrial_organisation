At Oak and Reeds, our definition of ""improv"" is the practice of unplanned interaction with others.  As much as we would like to rehearse and practice our lines for critical moments, there's no script sitting on our desk each morning, outlining all the things we'll say and do throughout the day. We work with each client to determine exactly which skills they seek to develop. We then guide the client's team through custom, improv-based workshops with activities picked to hone the desired skills. After each engagement, we leave participants with a development plan for how they can continue to practice the new skills. These plans can then be folded into ongoing learning and development strategies.","Education, Professional Services",1,Dave Collins,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
