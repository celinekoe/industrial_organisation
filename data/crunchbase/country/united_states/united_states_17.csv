Spice Wing started with the need for a genuinely specialized Chicken Wing store offering the best wings, at the best prices, and savory sides, available anywhere in America, such as waffles and four different kinds of fries. There are many chicken-specific restaurants and many specializing in chicken wings. Only Spice Wing has mastered the sauce and chicken combination to give our customers the consistency and taste that the true wing lover needs. We are now one of the country's fastest-growing concepts, attracting top entrepreneurs and operators with the drive and enthusiasm to own their own business. With different degrees of spiciness, the company developed its signature sauces. Sweet BBQ, Teriyaki, Moderate, Parmesan Garlic Sauce, Medium, Honey BBQ, Spicy Garlic, Hot BBQ, Hot, Habanero Mango, Wild and Blazin 'are among the sauces. Near college campuses and increasing suburban areas, most of the outlets are located. The founders took it in stride with little experience in the restaurant industry, handling their finances in order to expand their business and opening up new locations. Spice Wing is dedicated to serving wings that taste amazing not only, but are great for YOU as well. It is our passion to supply healthy, sustainable, and fresh food. Combined with our Embassy Award winning chef, our high-quality ingredients create an environment that is both atomic and welcoming for all of our guests. Spice Wing aims to be the best in the industry for WING men and women.

Then bring this value to our customers so they can add what would have been lost profit into the value of their own home or business. Give the power back to the customer. Completely disrupt what has been well over half a century of inefficient supply to the end user!” A lot of academics and Business schools would say this paragraph above is impossible. I believe and please any English teacher or journalist correct me is an oxymoron. You cannot offer all of this without impacting one aspect. So you cannot have Low Price, Quality, Value, Quick Shipping and Service. One must be surrendered to achieve the others. But academics also thought Fedex Paper by George W Smith at Yale in 1965 was unrealistic as well. I believe this model is possible but it takes working together our customers with us for the saving to work, we work together! Particularly on the natural stone. All we need customers to do is read. Read the Terms of Sale and our FAQ’s and particularly the top 10 mistakes people make. If we work together the impossible is possible.  But it really does need the final step our customers. We have gone to the trouble of removing every conceivable cost from the supply chain (even debt, debt is a cost to many businesses we have none and that cost is not passed on through our products, that cost can be 8.5% or higher). We need are customers help on the last step, maybe you have a counter you are matching Carrara to, or need a particular look, then these are things we should talk about. (We do not know the look of the countertop you purchased if we are not sent a picture). If we work together instead of viewing a bathroom remodel as a going to loose 30% (as the industry has created) to a ‘gain 30% on the value of your home‘. Together we can change an industry from a consumers loss to a consumers gain in property value. The impact on America would be incredible.  A home underwater by $5K could be above water. Risk of foreclosure lower. I never could understand an industry that was created around “buy our product have it installed and once you have done so do not expect 100% return on your investment”. Yet people have believed this for decades and decades. We want to change this and we will give it a go",Commerce and Shopping,,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Too many startups – include those of our founder – struggled forming enterprise partnerships. Startups spend too much precious time and money chasing corporate deals that don’t materialize.   Our beginning started with a simple hypothesis: would partnerships happen faster if they started with the corporate need; rather than the startup solution? To test the hypothesis, we gathered an incredible team of dedicated startup supporters to host an event. The format: large companies pitch innovation needs to an audience of startups – thereby switching the traditional pitching format. And so SwitchPitch began – initially as an event.   As the event format spread and gained popularity, corporates made it clear they needed an ongoing solution to identify and manage startup relationships. The SwitchPitch platform initially supported the projects / challenges presented at the event – enabling startups to apply to projects online.   Corporate usage increased and SwitchPitch expanding into an enterprise startup relationship management (SRM) platform. Along the way, we attracted an impressive group of investors, include Dreamit Ventures. Our vision is simple: corporate / startup partnership are the way all enterprises do business.   Today, innovation teams from top Fortune 500 companies use the platform’s proprietary startup database to scout startups, pipeline relationships, engage in pilot projects, and get deals done. True to our roots, we still enable enterprises to post challenges to our online marketplace, where startups find relevant projects and apply to them.","Administrative Services, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Internet Services, Other, Professional Services, Science and Engineering, Software",1,Michael Goldstein,11-50,1,,,USD,,,USD,,Exhilarator,,1,,Private,,,,,,
