Let say you want something badly - for example a Sony PS3 console; but all you have is a fancy pen, perhaps given to you by an Uncle three years ago. Of course no one is going to trade PS3 for your pen. But what if someone has a PS3 and would like to exchange it for an X-Box. Some guy who's got an X-Box to trade wants to replace the carburetor in his car, and a lady whose father owns a  mechanic shop wouldn't mind asking daddy to spare one of those carburetors laying around the garage for her antique pen collection. So that leaves a trail for you to connect the dots. Start with something little - something you have, connect and trade it up until you find and get something you want. There is no selling of products between users, trades between users are practically Free!","Advertising, Commerce and Shopping, Sales and Marketing",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
