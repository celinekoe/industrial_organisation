If you've stumbled upon this page, it likely means that you've already read through our website, checked our our LinkedIn, Facebook, and all of our other social sites! We've decided to dedicate this space to sharing a little bit about what makes our New Orleans firm unique. We're not referring to our marketing campaigns; we're actually referring to the attributes and values that fuel the ongoing success in our work. Here are 10 behaviors we value at SilverFirst Inc: 1) First is integrity. This is the foundation for all that we do at SilverFirst Inc. We believe that results count for nothing if they're not earned honestly. We take pride in what we do. We wholeheartedly believe that being genuine and honest is always the answer. 2) Providing opportunity for our people. Working with the best comes with an important responsibility. We are the first to recognize the difference between a job and a career: a job is a short-term fix to put cash in your pocket, and a career is a long-term plan about which you're excited. We believe in nurturing and developing the talents of our team and providing them with career options worth getting excited about.  3) Cultivating a work environment that provides daily enrichment and learning. Other than a fast track to management, the biggest perk of our management training program at SilverFirst Inc is the hands-on learning. Our trainees are challenged each and every day. They are given new responsibilities on a weekly, even daily, basis. We hate stagnation and we strive for our people to always feel like they're growing. 4) Rewarding hard work. We offer advancement to those who earn it. Bonuses are fun too! We believe that positive reinforcement is one of the best ways to motivate our people. We love to spoil our team from time to time -- but first they have to earn it! The words ""merit based"" mean everything to us. 5) Operating as a team. Or one big family, you could say. Our mentality in Metairie is centered around a ""people helping people"" philosophy. We believe that having each other's backs is the only way to win. We believe that in helping others, we also help ourselves. While we're individually competitive, our focus is on the success of the team. 6) Leading by example. No one moves up at SilverFirst Inc without first mastering the position(s) below him or her. There's an important reason for this! The leaders at our firm will never ask their team members to do anything they haven't already done, or wouldn't be willing to do themselves. If that alone doesn't make us unique, we don't know what does!  7) Investing time in relationships. We said it already: SilverFirst Inc is a family. We got that way by spending quality time with one another, learning about histories, motivations, families, and more. We all get together after work on a weekly basis. We blur the lines of ""work life"" and ""personal life"" and it happens to be awesome. 8) Doing what it takes to get the job done. We do not believe in excuses. We believe in taking accountability for both the good and the bad results. We encourage our team members to think like business owners: ""What would you do if this was 100% your responsibility and the only options were to sink or swim?""... that kind of thing! 9) Having a positive attitude. It's all about the glass being half full. Bad things happen to everyone, even our team members. But we choose to rise above whatever negative circumstances we might be handed on a given day, week, month, or year. At SilverFirst Inc we're always looking forward. This is one of the major keys to our success. 10) Having fun and enjoying the ride. No one ever said that you can't have a blast while you're on the ride to the top. Not only do we have tons of fun at the office and after work, but we travel together, meet cool people, and do fun things.","Other, Professional Services, Sales and Marketing",1,Steve Silverthorne,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
