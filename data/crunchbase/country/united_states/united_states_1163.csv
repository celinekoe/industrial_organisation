See where Steve Jobs bumped into Michael Jackson and Princess Diana - each on a different story path  intersecting in one elevator.  Jump2Spot shows where notable people have been and history they made there.  Our mission focuses on enriching check-in locations with interesting stories.  Every business is a story (not an ad). Venues can interest nearby pedestrians with Jump2Spot stories to come in.   New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, London, Paris, Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver are major story hubs at Jump2Spot. We spent nearly two years, sequestered in a forest,  geo-tagging curated stories collected over many years online, in books and editorial. Each story has a photo/video and link. We aim to be a market leader in geo-content.  Our past venture experience includes working with digital teams of a US President & Nobel Prize winner; creating a mobile photo community powering Live Earth at 11,000 locations in an event inspiring 2 billion people; partnering with the World Cup; growing 1st download store to #1 in Canada; launching 1st NHL game (PPV) online; writing successful business plan for national news site; and sitting on advisory board with Intel & Microsoft.  We've had many lessons learned. We've also had breakthroughs and are no strangers to exits.  Advisors of Jump2Spot have product managed Blackberry  Messenger; been VP (Technology) at CISCO, Motorola and a major Juniper acquisition; developed IP acquired by AirBnB; advised SxSW and Mozilla;  received award for most inspiring social media user; contributed to The New York Times, National Geographic & TED; partnered with United Nations; managed a successful technology fund; facilitated history-making communities on a major mapping platform; managed social media for Expedia; launched a mobile museum tour and launched a TV Guide app.  Jump2Spot people have a passion for creating a new geo-frontier and new genre of geo-storytelling.

Our research and software development activities are geared towards maximizing the networked potential of these devices. Specifically for M2M networks and their use for smart grid - The Andromeda Embedded Services Framework allows, over standard HTTP, the devices themselves to be able to push data and control commands onto the network, as opposed to having data only be pulled if an embedded web server only is used. By having this push capability, the device requires less (or even none in some cases) host control, which allows for greater automation, less bandwidth usage and more security over an embedded web server only solution.
