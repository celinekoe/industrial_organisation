Headquartered in Portland, Oregon, the company has offices and customers throughout the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. Our brands, products, and services include Routeware, Core Computing Solutions, EasyRoute, Webaspx, RouteOptix, Andrews Software Inc. (ASI), and now ReCollect.   Managing routes--residential, commercial, or roll-off--is a dynamic, fluid process. Route changes, driver issues, run backs, and truck maintenance issues all compete for your attention. Traditionally, waste haulers have managed this challenging workload with paper, multiple dispatch sites, and expensive radio and cell phone communications. At Routeware, we've pioneered a system that automates all of that. Route adjustments, truck locations, and pick-up/drop-off activity are now communicated automatically between the truck and the office. Your trucks become rich data collectors, feeding everything they're doing back to the office in real-time. Using Routeware's powerful reporting tools, everyone in the office can see exactly what's unfolding on every route. This kind of visibility leads to cost savings, route consolidation, better driver management, reduction of paperwork, and increased revenue.   From product engineering to sales and marketing, everything we do is focused on our customers--not only those who use our products but the tens of thousands of homes and businesses our hauling partners service every day. We understand that hauling is a mission-critical, 24/7 business, with the absolute need to pick up 100% of the trash 100% of the time. To do that, haulers need tools that let them see and manage everything that's going on with their drivers and trucks...and connect it with everything that's happening in the office. That's what we do; provide you with the means to transform your hauling operation into a lean competitive business.   If these things are important to you--strengthening the driver/management relationship, increasing accountability, reducing costs, and improving the efficiency of your organization--give us a call. Let's start a conversation about how we can put the power of Routeware to work for you.","Information Technology, Other, Software, Transportation",1,Steve Kaufmann,101-250,3,M&A,1569550,USD,1569550,1569550,USD,1569550,,,,7,Private,,,,,,

The battery not lasting as long as needed and preventing anyone from ever losing another vaporizer again. We wanted to make sure anyone trying to quit smoking had a way to ensure they would never go back to traditional cigarettes. As former smokers our own biggest problems with vaporizers were that they would die without warning, usually when we needed them most, and losing them by leaving them behind because we didn't have a designated place to store them when we weren't using them, except our pockets. At Vaportronix, our mission has always been to provide the best way to prevent anyone from having to go back to smoking cigarettes again! Using our patented technology, we released our first product, the VQase, in July 2016. The VQase was a phone case designed for the iPhone 6, 7, & 8 with the ability to store and charge our proprietary vaporizer, the VQ Stick. With the rise of Juul brand vaporizer and feedback from customers, we came to the conclusion that we needed to come up with a universal solution to ensure everyone could always have their favorite vaporizer charged, and with them. We wanted to test this theory, so we invented the VQ Lite in January 2018. It was a simple silicone holder designed to be attached to any surface, but primarily your phone, using super strong 3M brand adhesive, so you always knew where your vaporizer was, and you always had a designated place to put it. Our theory was proven when we sold over 100,000 units in the first year and countless Chinese factories copied our design after seeing our success. Although the VQ Lite was our most successful product, it only solved one of the two problems we had set out to solve and our customers only complaint was that once it was stuck to a desired surface there wasn't a way to stick it anywhere else after that. After a year or research and development and countless different conceptions we are finally proud to introduce the VQ Volt! The world's most innovative portable vaporizer charger! The VQ Volt is our first removable portable charger that can be attached and removed from any surface you would want easy access to a vaporizer charger. Using our latest patented technology, you can attach our VQ Volt to the back of your phone, your nightstand, your car dashboard, your desk, or any surface you would want to charge your vaporizer and know exactly where you left it last. The VQ Volt can be attached to any surface by using our VQ Steel Plates and the integrated magnets built into the VQ Volt. Simply attach one of the provided VQ Steel Plates to the desired surface and attach the VQ volt on top of the steel plate and you're ready to start charging your vaporizer. Want to charge your vaporizer somewhere else? Just pull the VQ Volt off of the steel plate and attach it to another location you have attached the additional steel plate we have provided. Take it with you when you want, or leave it behind when you don't, but you'll always know where you left it, and your vaporizer, last. With the VQ Volt we believe we have created a universal approach to every vaporizer user's biggest problem with their device. The VQ Volt is compatible with every cell phone model, can be attached to any flat surface, and can even be attached to your existing magnetic air vent clip that you may have in your car already. Our VQ Steel plates can also be used to attach your phone to any existing magnetic air vent clip for your car so if you have two air vent clips you can attach both your phone and the VQ Volt to have easy access to both while driving. The VQ Volt provides a truly portable charging experience and a place to always store your vaporizer when you aren't using it, so you never lose another vaporizer again! VQ by Vaportronix.

Then, with a business analytic layer, matching data is run through algorithms to make recommendations both efficiently and timely.  The team has spent 10 years on the ground manually matching health system and insurance data directly with patients to make prudent recommendations around better quality and lower-cost healthcare. For the first time, due to interoperability and patient access regulations, we are compiling methodologies that draw on both parts of the system to make for a better patient experience.  // MILESTONES 2018 - Started R&D and Customer Discovery 2020 - Met with Health and Human Services (CMS/CCIIO Innovation Day) about interoperability/patient access 2021 - Participated in Ben Franklin Techcelerator 2021 - Participated in Pennsylvania Insurance Department Keystone Quickstart Program 2021 - Received Ben Franklin Grant 2022 - Filed as B-Corp 2022 - Rolling out MVP later this year //PLATFORM FOCUSES Cover - Before the cost of healthcare can be driven down, the needs of 160 million consumers who don't have access to employer coverage must have an objective source to get care. SnapHealth algorithms use health history, active medication lists, and income reporting to screen for prudent solutions and allow them to enroll right within the system. Compare - Between Health Equity, Rural Health needs, and Seniors with Caregivers trying to manage aging in place, SnapHealth will provide independent guidance on the most efficient methods to navigate healthcare. A patient must consider health networks, medical vendors, medication manufacturers, and programs available from their insurance, hospital, and government. SnapHealth will help sift through these programs and give patients access to tools ranging from Case Manager offers to Social Determinants of Health Programs. This is crucial when more seniors are aging in place. Response - As an untethered platform, the patient decides who and what can use their data. With deidentified records, we are looking to aggregate data in ways that would improve outcomes between the Opioid Crisis, Pandemic Response, AI interpretation of clinician natural language, and Clinical trials by using macro-level datasets. Outcomes - Feeds from NIH and other resources within trade groups and trusted health systems will advise patients on preventative care recommendations and outstanding screenings that are shown to be missing from the patient data on the platform. Circle - governance policies allow extended family, immediate family, and caregivers different levels of access and/or notices per your specific direction. Patients decide who knows what, and when. SnapHealth manages compliance and matching programs to ensure patient data is protected and shared ONLY at the direction of the owner of the data: the Individual.
