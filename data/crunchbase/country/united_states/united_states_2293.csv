In 1958, Pat Wasmond, a registered nurse and mother, was working in a local doctor's office. This doctor had a child who was severely handicapped, requiring 24 hour care. His family had difficulty managing this challenging situation. Pat offered her assistance and the child came to live with Pat, Bob and their children. Word spread in the Elgin area of this exceptional family and the wonderful care this child was receiving. Soon the Wasmonds began receiving calls from other families seeking this kind of help. It became evident to Pat there was a vital call for this type of care in the Elgin area. She and her husband decided to create a home for children with profound disabilities. Little Angels was founded. It all began with one family taking a child into their home.  And now, over 50 years later, Little Angels has grown into a 57 bed skilled care nursing facility. It remains owned and operated by the Wasmond family. In the 1970s, Pat and Bob's daughter Shelley became involved in the facility on a full-time basis and took over as Executive Director in 1979. Shelley, an RN, worked at Little Angels most of her life in one capacity or another, as did her ten brothers and sisters. This background gave her a unique perspective on all aspects of delivering quality care. Under Shelley's guidance, Little Angels strives to deliver the finest services possible in all areas.","Health Care, Other, Social Impact",,,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

GPS guides machines on autopilot. Engineered crops resist disease, lessen erosion, and improve yields. Drones scout crops. They are not far away from driverless tractors farming fields while the farmer monitors equipment remotely. Modernization has made traditional farming more efficient than ever. Changes to agricultural production are not just confined to the field. Robotic milking machines milk cows. Robotic swine feeders provide growing pigs their exact nutritional requirements. Anaerobic digesters turn livestock waste into fuel and electricity. Internet of Things (IoT) sensors monitor animals for health and well-being around the clock. A modern livestock farm is a technologically advanced and connected business. Technological advancements have also meant farming is no longer an isolated occupation. Farmers today must answer to consumers demands. Nearly every business in the food supply chain must address traceability and sustainability requirements from those that consume their products. The world has changed.      These changes are what bring us to work each day. They are why they built a law firm specifically tailored to the needs of those involved with agriculture--from the feed and input supplier, to the grower and producer, to the company that delivers the food to the table.    Agriculture is at an amazing crossroad today--a crossroad between longing about what farming used to be and the ideals shaping where farming is going. They are the law firm that works at this crossroad.  Their firm’s lawyers know farming because they came from farms and rural backgrounds. They share the values of farmers and those in the industry. At their core, they have a deep passion for agriculture.  They believe that those people focused on feeding a growing world deserve lawyers that understand what they do.
