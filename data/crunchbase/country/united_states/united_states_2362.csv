Osteoarthritis – a condition caused by the degradation of cartilage – is considered one of the leading causes of chronic disability worldwide and affects more than 20 million people in the U.S. alone. VasoLux’s technology quantitatively assesses the quality of cartilage, in vivo, in a non-destructive, minimally invasive procedure. Competing procedures and technologies, such as arthroscopy, MRI, CT, Ultrasound, OCT, and X-ray cannot provide physicians with an objective measurement capable of identifying the early progression of osteoarthritis, determining the true extent of a cartilage defect, or evaluating the quality of regenerated cartilage. Consequently, physicians lack the information needed to select the appropriate therapeutic intervention or revise their treatment plan if prior efforts have not reinvigorated the cartilage or prevented its degeneration. VasoLux’s diagnostic imaging system eliminates the subjective diagnoses of osteoarthritis, which in turn reduces inefficiencies in the health care system.","Data and Analytics, Health Care, Software",,,1-10,1,Seed,380000,USD,380000,380000,USD,380000,JumpStart,,1,,Private,,,,,,

ST has been described as an Eharmony like tool for career seeking professionals and recruiters. This system attracts the top 30% of talent as well as great opportunities and then matches them together by a profiling algorithm.  Through this new way of recruiting and job searching, employees no longer have to send their resumes to a black hole. Often a high level professional is not in the position to openly seek future employment, StrictlyTalent provides the confidentiality to do that. On the other hand, recruiters, hiring managers, and HR waste a lot of time receiving resumes from unqualified candidates. StrictlyTalent will not show the user-base which jobs and companies are in the system and even after a match is made, the relationship has to be requested and accepted by both parties to move forward.  StrictlyTalent does not claim to be the full solution, rather the initial platform or filter. The concept is to proactively manage a career and proactively recruit rather than reactionary actions when it's absolutely necessary.  Currently StrictlyTalent hosts two networks; StrictlyExecs (a network just for executive level positions) and StrictlyClosers (a network geared to high level sales and marketing professionals).  StrictlyWebDev and StrictlyITPros are the next networks that will be offered by StrictlyTalent.com","Administrative Services, Hardware, Information Technology, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Science and Engineering, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
