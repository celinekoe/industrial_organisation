It does this by utilizing a unique (patent pending) advertising approach of incorporating a company's brand and/or products into the gameplay. Myfitbrain is innovative brain training software offered at no charge to users due to its unique advertising model. Myfitbrain started with the premise of allowing everyone to benefit from fun software that stimulated the mind. For that to be possible, Myfitbrain came up with a new advertising model that allows advertisers to dynamically load products into the game pieces, significantly increasing product recognition compared to traditional advertising methods. Myfitbrain includes multiple types of mental fitness games focusing on different parts of the brain to sharpen the overall brain and encourage the generation of new brain cells. While some consumers exclusively enjoy games such as Sudoku or crossword puzzles which stimulate some areas of the brain, stimulating many cognitive areas of the brain is significantly more beneficial. The learning management system built into Myfitbrain will maintain a player's performance and drive them through the different games while challenging different cognitive abilities. The patent-pending advertising model will incorporate a company's brand name or products (icons) directly into the playing of the brain games. During play, users will be directly interacting with the icons. While people play the games, they will repeatedly say the icon name to themselves.  Myfitbrain will continue to develop more mental fitness games to keep the novelty of the game playing high which helps to stimulate the brain. Myfitbrain will work closely with its advertising partners and their agencies to develop challenging games that incorporate products into the games and that is stimulating to the mind. The software was developed in conjunction with Kreeda Games India Pvt. Ltd., located in Mumbai, India. The system is hosted utilizing cloud technology to enable rapid expansion with a robust infrastructure.","Advertising, Sales and Marketing",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Through the collective minds from leadership from some of the top innovative thinking companies internationally, Auxesis could be the first publically traded company whose sole purpose is to secure and grow the nation’s economy. The organization would be a portal to connect citizens in need throughout the nation with the philanthropic efforts of some of the nation’s biggest companies and organizations, thus connecting available resources to those in need in an extremely efficient way. The Auxesis platform would also be a highly effective way to focus the collective efforts of smaller companies and organizations, as well as donors, on the ability to foster highly effective campaigns which cater to a social-economic need or outcome. - What Makes This Special Auxesis’ online platform is a referral source for financial professionals around the country who are now working with their customer base to equip them with the education and the resources that make them informed and qualified consumers. In addition to this, Auxesis is quickly growing national attention through media and word of mouth as a resource to assist people in getting back on their feet in the midst of financial despair. As the organization grows in popularity it attracts the attention of community relation departments throughout the country who help us grow the resources we can provide our users in the form of financial assistance. Auxesis provides an opportunity that allows investors an opportunity to invest in a platform designed to grow both the middle and lower class Americans who are the largest pool of consumer spenders in the country. By providing these individuals an opportunity to grow their financial fingerprint in the economy, we are growing the economy itself while also growing the housing industry which is the foundation and one of the main key indicators of consumer confidence in the market. Investors have an opportunity to invest in their community and country while also securing or increasing the value of other assets owned such as stocks or property. In times of adversity and dips in the market, Auxesis only grows in popularity in terms of individuals who are using the platform for assistance, companies and organizations looking to connect to the growing pool of individuals in need of their services, and donors and investors.","Education, Financial Services, Internet Services, Other, Sales and Marketing, Social Impact",1,Dehaven L.
