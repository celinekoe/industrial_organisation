Mr. Hammer developed herbal formulas based on his knowledge of herbology from sources all over the world. He has studied Native American, South American, European, Egyptian, Ayurvedic, Tibetan, African, and Asian Medicine. Formula development is founded on the belief that combining a world body of herbal knowledge is greater than a single regional source. However, Asian and Ayurvedic medicine have greatly influenced how Mr. Hammer thinks about the application of herbal knowledge. The diagnostics and knowledge of natural medicine material are extremely valuable and synergistic when applied to other practices of herbal medicine. Combining the various systems of herbal medicine can only improve the practice of alternative medicine which Longevity Mountain Herbs strives to support. The Grandmasters of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) used and observed the effects of their formulas for over 2,000 years. By virtue of their quality, TCM formulas have survived the test of time. When properly prepared and applied, they help to build healthy bodies, prolong life and eliminate imbalances. TAM has remained hidden from the Western world… until now. Longevity Mountain Herbs is dedicated to discover and reveal the greatest secrets of Traditional Chinese Medicine to all who wish to learn. We are committed to providing an education in the use of these formulas, extracts, and medicines while offering them at a reasonable cost. It is our hope that we can relieve suffering while significantly improving the health and longevity of those we serve.
