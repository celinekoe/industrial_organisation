Once a product exceeds our ""combat ready"" quality assurance tests, they are ready for deployment.  At that point you'll be able to purchase them here. Why We Do It: Damn do we love MilSim sports.  But there is a big disconnect between the military and simulation aspect of our beloved game.  AirStrike Systems was started with the goal of bridging this gap through innovation, community building, and co-creation. Our Mission: To augment MilSim sports through the design, manufacture, and deployment of innovative, realistic weapon systems.  We will enhance gameplay and provide MilSim sports players with a competitive advantage by taking the realism of tactical warfare from the battlefield and placing it in their hands.  Our Vision: To implement AirStrike MilSim products into actual military training IOT provide the most realistic explosive disarmament and deterrence training for U.S. troops available. Our Values: Community:  MilSim sports are, and has always been, a community-centered team sport.  We believe this culture should develop far before the first shot is fired; we believe it starts with sharing, guiding, and co-creation. Honor, Courage, Commitment:  The same principles which apply in the U.S. Marines apply to AirStrike Systems.  As a Veteran Owned business, we take these principles very seriously and believe they are critical in successfully implementing a positive experience for every customer. Giving Back:  When all is said and done, it is how much we are able to give back with which we measure our success.  Therefore, we dedicate ourselves to this philosophy through mentoring, and  fundraising, donating, and volunteering our time at local charity foundations.

Pokens are small USB devices that allow a user to share personal information like name, address, phone, fax and email with other Poken users. Created by the Swiss company Poken SA, Pokens are extremely popular in Europe and Japan, and began sales in the US in April of 2009. **Poken solves one simple problem:** how do I remember the email addresses and screen names of everyone I meet?  When a user meets other Poken owners in the real world, they quickly swap information. No more writing down email addresses or long blog names. Just touch Pokens and connect. The ""digital business card"" also shares screen names and profile IDs from a variety of social networking services like MySpace, FaceBook,  Skype, LinkedIn and others. **How a Poken Works** Open an account at http://www.doyoupoken.com and set up your account. Load your social networking profiles, design your ""ID Card"". Poken users can touch Pokens, and look for the green light as they share Facebook, Twitter and other social network profiles. Users then simply plug the Poken into their computer's USB port, and download the data. **Models and Variety** Pokens come in a variety of shapes and models. As of October 2009, the ones most readily available in the U.S. were the brand new Business Poken ""Pulse"", the Panda Poken, the Alien Poken, the Ninja Poken, the Geisha Poken, the RapStar Poken, the Caveman Poken, the Rockstar Poken, the VooDoo Poken, the Mad-K Poken, the Poken Ghost, the Poken Bee, the Poken Tigress, the Poken Tiger, the Franky Poken, the Poken Pink Alien, the Poken Fox, the Poken Dragon, the Poken Baby, and the Vampire Poken. The brand new Poken Pulse was introduced in September 2009 in response to requests from corporate customers for a Poken that looked more professional. The Pulse sports a 2GB USB stick in a conservative black style, complete with the integrated Poken sharing technology. **Poken as Marketing and Branding Tool** Corporate customization and marketing integration of the Poken into a company's marketing plan is a specialty of PokenZoo.com. PokenZoo can customize Pokens with logos, specialized printing, and detailed interactive marketing programs. **Affiliate Program** [PokenZoo.com](http://PokenZoo.com) offers the most comprehensive affiliate program available.

And benefit they most certainly do. The winner of a game on eGainers also receives a voucher equal to the amount of their winning offer. They can use this credit to continue playing and winning other awesome products. And for the non-winning players, their lost credits are in fact, never lost. At eGainers we believe in fair play and giving everyone a second chance. All lost credits are saved in a newly developed section of our website known as the “MoneyBox Deals”. Here users can view a vast array of products that are listed for sale and discounted by their previously played non-winning offers. All of these products can be purchased immediately without having to wait for a game to end. This is just one of the many new features created with the player in mind. Users can easily create an account for free by visiting eGainers.com. Upon doing so, they will see several easy incentives to earn free credits. From liking our page on Facebook to inviting friends to play, we have given new players a chance to earn free credits and start winning products right away. With the great potential to have fun and win, we are sure that you won’t find anything else like eGainers on the web.",Commerce and Shopping,1,Massimo Colella,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
