SHARKMARX,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sharkmarx,"E-Commerce, Shopping","East Hartford, Connecticut, United States",SHARKMARX is a cloud purchasing platform for the home improvement industry that enables buyers to save on materials via reverse auctions.,"3,120,437","East Coast, New England, Northeastern US",Less than $1M,Closed,2013-01-04,day,,,2020-01-01,year,For Profit,http://www.sharkmarx.com,"SHARKMARX is a cloud-based purchasing platform for the home improvement industry that uses reverse auctions to save buyers an average of 15% on materials. Using crowdsourcing, SHARKMARX generates competitive bids on products like landscape materials, building products, and equipment.  With traction in the Northeast U.S. SHARKMARX will move into nationwide expansions. Phase I Landscaping industry | Northeast U.S. | in progress SHARKMARX successfully proved its concept by focusing on concrete pavers and walls and natural stone products in the Northeast U.S., a $309M market segment.  The launch was designed to validate the model and build brand trust for a new technology prior to expanding into the $1.9B national market.   These sales came from SHARKMARX’ “Get YOUR Price” reverse auctions, where contractors post their material needs and maximum price to open bidding.  SHARKMARX automatically solicits real-time, competitively priced bids from suppliers.  This bidding process drives prices down for buyers, while suppliers are able to expand their sales channel and reduce late receivables with SHARKMARX’ “patent pending” electronic payment process.   SHARKMARX has two primary revenue streams, both derived from the seller:  •	Annual subscriptions of $99  •	A transaction fee of 3% SHARKMARX will begin transitioning into its Phase II implementation during late Q3 and Q4 of 2013. This calculated, phased approach has helped SHARKMARX build brand trust among its initial target customer base, making it easier to convert and grow these customers into SHARKMARX Phase II rollout.  Phase II Landscaping industry | U.S. | growth stage As SHARKMARX builds brand trust with its landscape contractors, mason contractors, and suppliers, it can expand its business organically. As its customers realize savings on their hardscape goods, they will want to realize similar savings on other products they purchase. SHARKMARX can expand vertically with other products such as mulch, equipment, etc. SHARKMARX has already experienced this expected progression, successfully completing auctions for Ice Melt, Heating Oil and requests for lumber and fencing.  These additional materials in the landscape/masonry vertical market present significant opportunities to SHARKMARX. The table below illustrates the magnitude of this growth potential.  Phase II – Vertical Market Opportunities Market > Market Size Concrete pavers and walls* > $1.9 Billion Commercial mowing equipment > $5 Billion Mulch and Topsoil	 > $1.6 Billion Commercial Utility Trailers > $600 Million Waterscapes > $150 Million Heating Oil** > $11 Billion Raw Materials > $13 Billion Ice Melt ** > $2 Billion Phase III Home Improvement industry | U.S. | growth stage Similar to Phase II strategy, Phase III will capitalize on brand trust and proven savings performance established during its launch phase and expand into horizontal markets under the home improvement category. The targeted buyer in other home improvement markets has a similar profile to that of the current SHARKMARX landscape and masonry contractor.  Similarly, the problems facing a home improvement contractor are analogous to those facing the landscape/masonry contractor. (See ""Buyer Profile"" and ""Problems > Solutions"" on following pages.)  The table below illustrates the market opportunities to expand into other horizontal markets in home improvement.  Phase III – Horizontal Market Opportunities Market > Market Size Roofing shingles > $3.3 Billion Decking > $3.1 Billion Siding > $6.3 Billion Windows > $5.7 Billion Doors > $6.3 Billion",Commerce and Shopping,2,"Dan Degan, George Beiter",1-10,1,Seed,104000,USD,104000,104000,USD,104000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Designed for any level of music enthusiast, Maestro Touch provides a user-friendly interface that allows for instant creation. By-passing years of memorization and technical complexity, Maestro Touch presents a digital instrument that’s unlike anything on the market today. According to founder, Ben Scheuer, “Maestro Touch was the result of years of frustration learning to compose and write music. I recognized that much of the difficulty revolved around learning to master the technique of an instrument or memorizing scales and chords. This led me to envision a new type of instrument that was technically easy to play and that also exposed much of the theory behind composing music on the surface of the instrument.”   Maestro Touch is a brand new instrument with a unique interface. The app displays notes in a circular pattern, highlighting the notes that are in the scale of any selected key. This allows for easy melodic composition and creation of chords and harmony.  Each note is designated with it’s own color and when pressed, produce the sound. Maestro Touch comes with two instruments (piano and an instrument of the user’s choice), and more instruments can be purchased. The app has twelve keys and eight octaves to work with, as well as the option to use major, minor, or blues scales for every key.   Over 4500 people have already downloaded the app since its July release. “We’re really excited about the positive response to the app,” Scheuer said. “Due to the great feedback, we’re moving forward with additional features such as record and edit, custom sounds and instrument libraries, exporting and sharing of recorded work, and many more. Our Kickstarter page has more information about upcoming features and rewards for anyone wanting to get involved.”","Apps, Education, Media and Entertainment, Mobile, Music and Audio, Platforms, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Informal identification verification will also take place by allowing users to connect their Facebook and LinkedIn profiles. Once the user creates a profile, he/she may use the site as either an “employer” or a “contractor.” As an employer, the user may post a description of the service he/she needs performed, the terms of the request, and the price he/she is willing to pay for such service. As a contractor, the user may describe a service he/she is able to provide, the price for which he/she is willing to perform such service, his/her availability, as well as any qualifications he/she may feel are relevant.  MicroJob is not intended to provide long-term or full-time job opportunities. Instead, the site is intended for individuals looking for low-hour, infrequent work in order to supplement existing income or provide “spending money.”  While potential employers/contractors will have the ability to message one another to negotiate the terms of potential agreements, personal information (such as phone numbers and email addresses) will not be visible until an agreement has been reached. This will help deter offline communication by users who wish to avoid service charges. Once an agreement is reached and services have been performed, the employer and contractor will have the opportunity to review one another.

This journey started four years ago when they, Bill Campbell & Vlad Aleksiev, began discussing the idea of starting a business together. They considered several opportunities, but the main thread in all the choices was beer and brewing. They were really drawn to the craft brew industry because of the quality of product, the independence of the breweries, and the cooperative nature of the industry. They first considered opening a brewery, but as their discussions continued they found they were really excited about the connection between homebrewing and craft brew. As homebrewers themselves- Vlad a beginner and Bill a veteran - they know the fun and reward that can be felt from brewing your own craft beer, kombucha, mead, cider, or from making your own wine. It is thrilling to be able share your homecrafted brew with family and friends. Every batch you brew is filled with pride and satisfaction. There is also a camaraderie that is felt among homebrewers as they share their beer or other fermented beverage, their brewing stories and lessons learned.

Co-owners Chris Carboni and Lou Ann Loveless have spent the last several years moving toward the goal of creating unique beer in a unique City of Buffalo location, giving patrons a truly fun, unique and tasty experience. “No Boundaries” means just that—NBBE ventures outside the conventional rules of beer making to offer distinctive tastes and textures not only from beer to beer, but from batch to batch.  NBBE celebrates the varied explosive flavors and the subtle notes which are often hidden or eliminated for the sake of uniformity in the mass marketed and even many craft brewed beers of today.  Brewmaster Carboni has been creating well-received, delicious beers since 2007. Carboni was joined by his friend and NBBE business manager Loveless the following year as demand began to outpace Carboni’s ability to keep up with demands for the small batches of beer created in his basement brewery. The last several years have been spent in due diligence, perfecting recipes, testing ideas, and searching out the ideal location for the brewery.   Over the last 8 months, a site was chosen and architectural design work began. Marketing strategies have been designed and implemented; including branding and the design of a logo and website.  With a lease secured for space in an historic building nestled among grain elevators and malt houses along the Buffalo River, NBBE has also begun the process of acquiring state and local licenses and permits for operation. Early design work for the space calls for a tap room, tasting room, banquet space, and an outdoor patio on the banks of the river. NBBE is proud to look over the horizon to a day very soon, when Buffalonians will be enjoying handcrafted, delicious, unique beer in one of the city’s up-and-coming locations, in the shadows of plans for both the Buffalo River/Silo City area and nearby Ohio Street.","Food and Beverage, Media and Entertainment",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
