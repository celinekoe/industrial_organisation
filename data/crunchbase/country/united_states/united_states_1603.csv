We carry a database containing millions of royalty free stock photo, vector, graphics and pattern images to fit any project. GLASSarium Laser Machine has been particularly developed for the sub-surface engraving (3D-Printing) inside glass or crystal material using diode-laser. Specific technique of 'inner' engraving is the feature that the image is laser-engraved on the inside of the glass, no outer surface being altered in any way or form. Under normal conditions, the engraving below the surface is non-destructive, which results in a lifetime labeling that cannot be removed and will stay inside the glass forever, with no fade or loss of contrast. Both surfaces finish will always remain in its original condition. Almost anything can be laser-imprinted into the glass- from logos to landscapes. Each engraved piece is 'one of-a-kind', unless mass-produced. Most of the labelling is possible without using any consumable supplies.  Intensive research work, a high quality awareness and laser industry development are the reasons why this amazing technology is available to us today.

GateBridge seeks investments where it can earn long-term, high rates of return on its capital, by taking equity stakes in companies in partnership with a management team. While the primary focus is on technology related companies, they will consider and have experience with non-technology companies as well. Because it is not an institutional fund, GateBridge can be much more flexible than a traditional private equity firm and can consider a broad range of investments sizes: from very small early stage investments to arraigning complex large transactions requiring $100 million of capital or more. Also, because GateBridge does not operate a fund with a finite life, it can take a much longer term perspective on its investments than a traditional private equity fund which may need to exit an investment quickly to be able to raise it's next fund.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
