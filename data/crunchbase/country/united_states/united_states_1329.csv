It encourages users to socially compete to see who can use the most energy efficient means possible to get around in their day-to-day travels. The My Open Road mobile application makes saving energy a fun and engaging daily activity.  The mobile, patent-pending technology can detect a wide variety of transportation mechanisms that a user might take to get from point A to point B. The technology uses different âmodesâ of travel to identify when a user is driving a car, car pooling, commuting, traveling by rail, biking, or just walking. Each mode of travel is assigned a âSocial Responsibility Scoreâ based on its energy efficiency (illustrated below). We can also determine the energy efficiency of an individual userâs particular make and model vehicle. Gamification is accomplished by users socially competing for and maintaining a high âSocial Responsibility Score,â which is based on the userâs daily travel choices. The more energy efficient the choice of travel, the higher the userâs âSocial Responsibility Scoreâ. The userâs âSocial Responsibility Scoreâ can be used to unlock specials and discounts within our network of socially responsible merchants.
