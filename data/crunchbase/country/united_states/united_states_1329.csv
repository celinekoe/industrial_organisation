It encourages users to socially compete to see who can use the most energy efficient means possible to get around in their day-to-day travels. The My Open Road mobile application makes saving energy a fun and engaging daily activity.  The mobile, patent-pending technology can detect a wide variety of transportation mechanisms that a user might take to get from point A to point B. The technology uses different “modes” of travel to identify when a user is driving a car, car pooling, commuting, traveling by rail, biking, or just walking. Each mode of travel is assigned a “Social Responsibility Score” based on its energy efficiency (illustrated below). We can also determine the energy efficiency of an individual user’s particular make and model vehicle. Gamification is accomplished by users socially competing for and maintaining a high “Social Responsibility Score,” which is based on the user’s daily travel choices. The more energy efficient the choice of travel, the higher the user’s “Social Responsibility Score”. The user’s “Social Responsibility Score” can be used to unlock specials and discounts within our network of socially responsible merchants.
