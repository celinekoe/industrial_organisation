Because a public audience craves something we’re not trained to deliver as scientists: story. Story is the most important tool we have to engage human beings. Stories can educate, inspire, and drive action. But developing a powerful story is a skillset like any other. It takes time and training most scientists simply do not have. Here at Impact Media Lab, we work with scientists and science organizations to find the compelling threads in their research, then develop multimedia campaigns to share those stories with the world. Because we believe science is most impactful when we use the language of story. Over the past 5 years, our team has grown to include writers and filmmakers, photographers and illustrators, designers and journalists, all working together to tell meaningful stories about science. We have won awards, found adventure, and made lifelong friends in the greatest clients the world has ever known. If you’re a scientist or science organization looking to connect with a public audience, let’s dive into your story together!",,1,Kika Tuff,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
