Loxo Oncology is committed to bringing targeted cancer therapies rapidly into the clinic that have an opportunity for outsized clinical effects in genetically defined patient populations. Loxo Oncology derives its company name from an attendant of the Greek goddess Artemis, who represented the concept of trajectory in the sport of archery. It is an exciting time to develop cancer drugs. Diagnostic methods are yielding strong clues about which cancer features are actionable, “driver mutations,” in contrast to those merely along for the ride as “passenger mutations.” In the last five years, these insights have transformed the standard of care in melanoma, lung cancer and other cancers. Picking a target is just the first step in building a cancer drug. Good chemists build good drugs. The physical properties of a compound have much to do with its ultimate success or failure. Is it stable? Is it soluble? Is it absorbed? Does it reach its target? Does it engage the target? Does it cause toxicity elsewhere in the body before it achieves maximum efficacy in the cancer? In our opinion, drugs that achieve excellent exposure in the body and are highly specific for their intended targets have the highest chances of success. Once an attractive target is selected and a drug with best-in-class properties is constructed, setting up the right clinical development plan is of utmost importance. Our goal is to generate a clinical path that reflects the underlying scientific hypothesis that made the drug interesting in the first place. This often means developing the drug in a population of patients whose tumors possess a specific genetic vulnerability targeted by the drug. Loxo Oncology was built around a team of full-time professionals and engaged scientific advisors who are aligned in choosing the most actionable targets, and pursuing them through disciplined clinical trial approaches. Our license and collaboration agreement with Array Biopharma and our experienced team allows us to construct drugs with best-in-class properties from the ground up.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",1,Josh Bilenker,501-1000,6,M&A,506032500,USD,506032500,506032500,USD,506032500,"OrbiMed, New Enterprise Associates, Aisling Capital",3,3,,Public,2014-08-01,,,LOXO,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/loxo-oncology-ipo--a19afd6e,NASDAQ

Founded in 2015, Yieldstreet gives individuals access to alternative investments that have traditionally been off-limits to the average investor. With over $2.5 billion invested across multiple asset classes, Yieldstreet is changing the way people generate passive income by lowering and removing the barriers that historically kept these lucrative opportunities far out of reach.  In 2013, founders Milind Mehere and Michael Weisz were frustrated that many investment strategies were typically reserved only for institutions and the ultra-wealthy. Typically, the average investor was left to choose between the stock market and bonds with falling yields - with few options in between. Asset-based investments had longer hold periods and a higher barrier of entry, keeping them well out of reach of accredited investors — even more so for unaccredited investors. As a result, they decided to leverage the growing fintech disruption to give more people access to these previously restricted alternative investments.  Milind’s background in building companies, combined with Michael’s decade-plus experience within investing and fund management, formed the core of Yieldstreet. Passion for their investors and employees, as well as a willing embrace of innovation, has been part of Yieldstreet’s identity from the beginning. Each decision to leverage a new technology, investment strategy, or originate a new deal is made with the goal of putting investors first.  That drive has propelled Yieldstreet across all 50 states, crossing $100M invested in less than eight quarters, with the $1B milestone coming only three years later. In 2019, Yieldstreet’s membership had grown to 100,000, and a savings account for members was launched.  Yieldstreet, since its launch in 2015, has not deviated from its goal to change investing for the better, nor has it slowed down. Yieldstreet was ranked as number 46 on the Inc. 5000 list of the fastest-growing companies and has been recognized by Built In as one of the Best Places to Work. Yieldstreet today delivers wealth generation options and alternative investments for more than 330,000 investors and has returned more than $1.3 billion in principal/interest.  Many alternative investment platforms only focus on one asset class, such as real estate or art. Yieldstreet’s offerings, accessed through cash or a low-fee IRA, cover a wide range of asset classes — art, real estate, legal, corporates, consumer, and commercial, via single investments or funds. Yieldstreet also offers its members short-term notes on offerings with a hold period between 3 and 6 months, which generally boast higher interest rates than money markets and CDs.  Yieldstreet is headquartered in New York and has offices in Brazil, Greece, and Malta. Michael Weisz serves as President and Milind Mehere serves as CEO. Together, they manage a team of more than 140 employees, all working toward Yieldstreet’s one goal: change the way people invest for the better.",Financial Services,3,"Dennis Shields, Michael Weisz, Milind Mehere",101-250,9,,294697463,USD,294697463,794697463,USD,794697463,"Gaingels, Monroe Capital, FJ Labs, Edison Partners, Raine Ventures",8,17,3,Private,,,,,,

Whether you use contractors or employees to service your customers or products, your brand reputation is at risk every day.  Qmerit is a software platform that enables you to manage, measure, and motivate your contractors and employees to excel while gaining visibility into their service quality. Qmerit’s patent-pending algorithms allocate the best resource at the best value for every service request. Whenever equipment in a building is being serviced, parts and materials are often required.  Contractors and building engineers purchase over $100B in parts and equipment each year for service, maintenance and retrofits, but no one has successfully aggregated these purchases.  Qmerit has partnered with Avendra to aggregate this spend and use this leverage with suppliers and OEM’s to maximize discounts on parts and materials and provide Amazon-like eProcurement software to access these deep discounts. At the heart of the platform is our Qmerit Contribution Index (QCI™) performance measurement system that is used for your workforce and your suppliers. The QCI is a continuously calculated score based on past performance, callback rates, procedural compliance and more.  Similar to a FICO® score, QCI scores are visible to all key stakeholders, creating a powerful motivation framework that incentivizes desired behavior and provides real-time performance feedback.
