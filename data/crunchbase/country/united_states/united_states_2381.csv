Layer Four Solutions was founded in February 2009 to provide Internet Service throughout Chicago. Today Layer 4 benefits from the established infrastructure and business services support of Layer Four Solutions while maintaining independence for product design and development decisions.  We believe that business phone systems today consist of the following three elements; Core functionality, legacy features and useful applications. Core functions, like calling, voicemail, transfer, hold, etc. are essential, they must be 100% reliable and a carrier will be judged against the competition based on their quality. Legacy features are those that only exist because they always have. They are holdovers from bygone technology and most people don’t need them. They are only used because of tradition. Useful applications are those that create real value for the user. These are the features that set a provider apart from the pack, but unless these features are simple, intuitive and convenient they might as well not even exist. We leverage our proven platform and drop the burden of legacy features and built upon it a new communications platform that adapts to our users because we don’t believe users should need to adapt their business to the way their phones work.  Until now VoIP services have focused on replicating traditional phone systems so closely that most have built in the same frustrations customers are trying to avoid. Rather than try to simulate analog technology in a new package, we are building the next generation of hosted voice services. The number of deployed hosted business Voice over IP seats are estimated to double between 2012 and 2016. With no clearly established market leader in the industry today Layer 4 is in a unique position to dominate the emerging market.""",Internet Services,,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
