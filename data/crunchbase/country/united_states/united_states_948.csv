Other cities have done just this, and been able to provide their residents with higher speeds at lower costs. Seattle has the added advantage of already having 550 miles of high-speed fiber in the ground already. A 2014 report by the city found that ""nearly 20% of Seattle residents do not have any Internet access.” Entire neighborhoods still lack access to Internet speeds necessary to take part in the modern economy. Without access, residents may not be able to apply for jobs, utilize city websites, finish their homework, operate a small business, display art, shop online, or video chat with a doctor from the comfort of their homes. As a city-owned public entity, municipal Internet would be democratically controlled and accountable. Seattle’s Internet would guarantee that public Internet respected the rules of Net Neutrality even if private companies do not.
