GoTek Energy, Inc. develops, manufactures, and licenses clean technology, yet fuel agnostic, rotary (non-Wankel) internal combustion engines that propel all types of land, water, and air transportation as well as drive stationary power generation devices to produce electricity, compressed air, vacuum, and heat exchange plus power industrial equipment. GoTek’s DynaKinetic™ rotary engines (which are not Wankel engines) run on clean natural gas or propane to reduce harmful emissions and can also run on a second common fuel to increase the mileage range or run time. GoTek’s piston-free rotary engine design converts clean and standard fuels into energy more efficiently than traditional engines, by eliminating much of the mechanical complexity (and associated energy loss) of piston-based engines and does so with increased performance. GoTek Energy, Inc. will also develop, manufacture, and license rotary multi-stage capable compressors to pressurize and flow gases for directly creating compressed air and heat exchange and pumps to flow liquids and enable fluid transfer which are both leveraged from the engine technology. GoTek’s DynaKinetic™ rotary compressors and pumps flow significantly more gas or liquid per revolution and achieve this performance in a reduced size and weight package.","Consumer Electronics, Consumer Goods, Energy, Hardware, Manufacturing, Sustainability, Transportation",4,"B.
