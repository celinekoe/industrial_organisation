Imagine if a vehicle was half the width of other traditional automobiles, yet was still safe, quick, beautiful, zero emission…and affordable.  That is precisely what Helix Motors has created. Data shows that 90% of all daily commutes and 78% of all driving occurs with just 1 occupant in a vehicle.  So, most of society is simply buying too large a vehicle for its daily needs.  What inhibited mass adoption was the lack of stability in high speed braking and turning maneuvers, that problem is solved by a vehicle that leans into a turn and Helix’s patented solution solves that problem in a modern electronic way similar to aircraft systems. The vehicle is a 3 wheel vehicle that tilts into the turns like a motorcycle or jet fighter using an electronic “steer by wire” system applied from the aircraft industry.  The design represents a new form factor which is twice as efficient as other electric vehicle solutions due to its size (we are calculated to realize over 300 MPGe).  The vehicle is designed to hold two people, one in front of the other, at a comfort level equal to a BMW 6 series sedan.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Manufacturing",1,Helen Lee,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Las Vegas Sun is the first media organization that won the top awards in all three journalism areas of print, online, and broadcast. In 2009, it won the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, journalism’s most prestigious award, for its investigation of construction deaths on the Las Vegas Strip and the failures of government, management, and labor unions to protect workers.

Nathan leads a team of top professional digital marketers from around the country whose specialties include but are not limited to Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Social Media Marketing (SMM), Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) and Pay-Per-Click Management (PPC). Arcane Marketing's exceptional team of marketers and technicians provide innovative strategies and professional recommendations to each and every client based on their individual needs as well as comprehensive web design and excellent customer support. Our unique team combined has over 4 decades of experience in all aspects of digital marketing. Not only do we understand the importance of Search Engine Marketing (SEM) better than anyone else, we understand business as well. It's our number one priority to create a strategy that is most effective for your business. Not every strategy is right for every business so you will never get cookie cutter service from us. Our firm will not rest until you see results. Your success is our #1 priority. We believe that there is no better way to be involved and focused on a client and their online marketing success than when everyone on the team is engaged with the client personally. Larger agencies tend to lose their clients in the mix and the relationships that we build with our clients are just not there when a large marketing firm is hired for the same job. Many of our clients that have worked with larger agencies in the past are extremely satisfied with our services for not only are we supplying them with better service, we are supplying them faster results on a smaller budget. Many of our clients have also just been under-serviced in the past and just not getting a good value of money paid in online marketing services versus what they actually receive. That is where we step in and with research, analysis and strategies custom tailored for your specific needs are offered and implemented. Digital Marketing is not just one thing. It is not just SEO or PPC, It is not only social media or link acquisition. It is a strategically balanced blend of everything that if implemented correctly will produce long lasting results. Arcane Marketing understands this, knows how to effectively handle this and is the reason why we have so many satisfied clients.","Advertising, Content and Publishing, Design, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Professional Services, Sales and Marketing, Video",1,Nathan Hawkes,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The Arizona Legislature provided seed money for SCF, which was paid back by 1938. Since that time, SCF Arizona has been funded entirely by policyholders' premiums and by investments. SCF receives no state funds and is not tax supported. In 1969, the Arizona Legislature separated SCF from the Industrial Commission, allowing SCF to begin operating as a private business. The Legislature continued to cut ties with SCF in 1983, when it exempted the company from following state procurement rules under Title 35. In 1990, a further separation occurred, when the Legislature removed SCF from the state personnel and state risk management systems. And in 2004, a Maricopa County Superior Court Judge ruled that SCFâ€:tm:s fiduciary duty is to its policyholders and not to the State of Arizona. SCF is fully competitive and operates under the same rules, rate structure and regulations as all private insurance companies providing workersâ€:tm: compensation insurance in Arizona. In 2007, SCF Arizona launched SCF Premier Insurance Company, a wholly owned subsidiary that gives the company more flexibility in premium rates for SCFâ€:tm:s largest and safest companies.
