This concept has been pitched to two regional offices of CBS and NBC and received with great enthusiasm.   We will form the media division which will hold all of the media assets of the company including the internet TV stations, and the reality show. With this raise we will produce an hour per day of the Reality TV show and stream that through our Internet TV station to build audience for a year before selling this to a network TV station or video distribution company such as Yahoo! Google, or Netflix. This is highly profitable and builds a huge audience for the platform. We will reduce front end risks by working with entities and people who will vet and value the people and the deals allowing only onto the Kloud Angels site deals that appeal to the broad market. That is where the profit is and that reduces the risk to the investors.  We will have the value checked by a third party to ensure reasonable transactions are posted to the platform.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations applying to them through their life cycle. By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more efficient regulation; offers measurable benchmarks for reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business climate of each economy. In addition, Doing Business offers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in different cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other cities in the economy or region and with the 189 conomies that Doing Business has ranked. The first Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This yearâs report covers 11 indicator sets and 189 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The project has benefited from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.","Content and Publishing, Financial Services, Media and Entertainment",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The goal of the website is to help educate and inform through an unbiased and open-minded approach. Pragmatic Capitalism (http://pragcap.com) was founded by Cullen Roche in the midst of the financial crisis of 2008.  Mr. Roche foresaw many of the events that led up to the crisis and felt that the government was slow to react and when it did finally react, responded with the wrong medicine.  Using his expertise in the financial markets and the monetary system, Mr. Roche provides objective answers to the worldâs big macro questions. Pragmatic Capitalism has become a place where investors, economists and laypeople can discuss complex financial issues and find answers to the ever problematic world of economics. Mr. Roche doesnât pretend to have all the answers, but provides his expertise where possible to help others learn and become more financially aware.  Ultimately, the goal of the website is to try to provide a resource for better understanding and a forum for discourse and debate (see here for more).
