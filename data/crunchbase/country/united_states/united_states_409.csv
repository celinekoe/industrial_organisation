The Market: Years of research on a club concept and pricing has been performed. We have successfully attracted members during our pricing research at gun shows and online. We have identified that while guns and ammo are shopped for the best pricing, accessories are not. This is a huge area on which to concentrate and to leverage.    Our Goal: The sports weapons industry is currently one of the most fragmented industries in the U.S. Individuals are unable to find the best prices. Arm & Protect aims to consolidate an otherwise fragmented industry by providing a retail and web presence as a wholesale buying club for best pricing.    Our Members: Will value the opportunity to earn discounts for bringing others into the club and sharing the experience of buying at a great price.","Commerce and Shopping, Financial Services, Sports",,,1-10,1,,170000,USD,170000,170000,USD,170000,,,,,Private,,,,,,
