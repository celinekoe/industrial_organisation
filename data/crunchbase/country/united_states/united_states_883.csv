We are not developing our network from the executive floor; instead we are on your campus, in your classrooms, and at your career fairs to make sure we can bring the necessary tools to your hands, and get you hired. School should be the biggest priority to a college student, and we strive to make sure you are able to find a job you can be passionate about, without spending an unnecessary amount of time doing so.  Saving money on recruiting, career fairs, sorting resumes, and contacting candidates allows our companies to focus on more important goals.
