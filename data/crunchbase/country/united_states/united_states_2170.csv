As he began building better and faster engines, he discovered he couldn't always find or afford the specialized high-end parts he needed. So he began making them himself. After many years of working at machine shops, he learned that with planning, patience, and attention to detail he could produce any part he needed. In 1991 Bill established his own machining business specializing in the difficult parts other machine shops had turned down. Success required expansion so in 1997 Shields Manufacturing moved to a 10,000 sq. ft. location in Sherwood, Oregon. In addition to the machined parts, it became clear that there was a market for mechanical assembly, using the same passion and fanaticism for quality. The new business rapidly grew and in 2006 an additional 10,000 sq. ft. of space was added, this included clean rooms for optical assembly. The business continued to grow with the addition of plastic fabrication in 2010, rounding out our ability to machine, fabricate, assembly and integrate for a diverse range of industries. Building on our reputation and high performing team growth continued, in 2013 we moved into our current 67,000 sq. ft. facility.","Manufacturing, Science and Engineering",1,Bill Shields,101-250,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
