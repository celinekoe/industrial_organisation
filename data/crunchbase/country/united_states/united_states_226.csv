NewsBox is integrating with popular content creation and collaboration products, giving users of those platforms the ability to push content to their followers on NewsBox as a ‘destination’ site.  NewsBox is also integrating with other social networks, giving users the ability to share content and push to those networks, which creates a central repository for content distribution.  As a destination site, NewsBox helps fill the need for quality platforms to publish native content.  Unlike competing products, we are on-boarding readers while also integrating with a large number of popular platforms to extend reach.   NewsBox gathers data from across the web, and from publishers publishing on the platform, to provide a hub of media intelligence.  Our unique media monitoring can provide mentions, trends, sentiment and other valuable data that goes beyond free keyword alert systems.  Our up-and-coming insights and analytics will provide valuable dashboards for various users in a number of verticals, including healthcare/pharma, legal, and entertainment, while also addressing the needs of the departments within companies and organizations that our users represent. Problems: Reputation management Cost justify quality content creation Cluttered platforms Reach targeted readers Premium subscription options Read.  Publish.  Monitor.   NewsBox is an affordable, cloud-based SaaS solution that combines the best elements of popular PR software, social media monitoring tools, content distribution and business intelligence systems into a single platform useful to various departments within a business.  It is a stable, mature, fully supported platform.  The NewsBox solution helps companies manage paid, earned, and owned media on a single platform, providing options to advertise, reach journalists and influencers, and integrate data, widgets, and tools into existing websites and other media. NewsBox provides comprehensive, yet affordable, media monitoring while delivering more value than simple key-word tools or news readers.  Search engines index web content regularly, but they often don't catch content immediately after publication, especially from lesser known long-tail publishers and blogs, and they don't have access to premium content behind the paywall.   NewsBox media intelligence platform helps businesses reduce risk and associated costs, and provides a faster, more organized solution for the information worker to manage media mentions and following content of importance. Every company has a brand.  Online content affects the company’s ability to attract and maintain customers and talent.  The company’s brand can be over 70% of the company’s value.  The old way of monitoring media mentions was to manually save newspaper and magazine clippings, or hire a PR company to compile.   NewsBox is a great option for anyone to self-manage their online PR but is ideal for ad agencies, PR firms, professional service firms and corporations.  PR firms can use NewsBox for online brand management.  Marketing departments can use it to publish native content for inbound marketing and measure ROI.  Management can use NewsBox to stay on top of competitors, follow influencers and stay current on industry news from a broad range of top publications. NewsBox is an intelligent alternative to current outdated newsletter solutions.  Newsletters account for over 65% of marketing e-mails sent.  NewsBox gives publishers the ability to reach readers without e-mail yet still includes e-mail for non-NewsBox members.  By using less e-mail, NewsBox reduces spam and the associated likelihood content will not reach a reader’s inbox.  Users can host high-resolution graphics on NewsBox instead of adding them to e-mail and risk being stopped by firewalls and e-mail filters.   [*] SaaS companies; instead of developing and marketing downloads or disks, offer software online as a subscription service.

To serve these highly regulated businesses, they decided to re-architect their network to provide the highest available standard of reliability and security. Knowing that any outages or network issues could result in significant losses to their customers, they committed to building a network with 2-layers of redundancy in an active-active architecture, between dual data centers.

Stationary components can be learned by traditional machine learning methods as they are stable in time. Transient components are dynamically changing depending on independent factors not directly available to the user.
