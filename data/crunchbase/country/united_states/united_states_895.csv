Since our founding in 1985, we have pursued a single mission â providing immigration policymakers, the academic community, news media, and concerned citizens with reliable information about the social, economic, environmental, security, and fiscal consequences of legal and illegal immigration into the United States. The Center is governed by a diverse board of directors that has included active and retired university professors, civil rights leaders, and former government officials. Our research and analysis has been funded by contributions and grants from dozens of private foundations, from the U.S. Census Bureau and Justice Department, and from hundreds of generous individual donors. Our board, our staff, our researchers, and our contributor base are not predominantly ""liberal"" or predominantly ""conservative."" Instead, we believe in common that debates about immigration policy that are well-informed and grounded in objective data will lead to better immigration policies. The data collected by the Center during the past quarter-century has led many of our researchers to conclude that current, high levels of immigration are making it harder to achieve such important national objectives as better public schools, a cleaner environment, homeland security, and a living wage for every native-born and immigrant worker. These data may support criticism of US immigration policies, but they do not justify ill feelings toward our immigrant community. In fact, many of us at the Center are animated by a ""low-immigration, pro-immigrant"" vision of an America that admits fewer immigrants but affords a warmer welcome for those who are admitted.",Sales and Marketing,1,Otis L.

No other North American company works the same way we do. While many online support companies are solutions looking for a problem, we build our services around the missions of colleges and provide support only where it is needed. To that end, we are very flexible to each college and university we work with, and increasingly, our partner colleges are coming up with additional ways we can serve them. In his doctoral dissertation, Dr. Bob Williams examined the use of graduate teaching assistants in an online program. GTAâs have been thoroughly examined in academic literature for over 40 years; however, this was a groundbreaking study of GTAâs in an online classroom environment. Using best practices, Instructional Connections pioneered the use of teaching assistants, AKA, âAcademic Coachesâ in online classrooms. On average our coaches have 17 years of experience and have earned a minimum of a graduate degree in their field. Our coaches now serve more than 30 thousand students in 27 universities and 50+ college programs with our highly effective proprietary ""academic coaching model,"" which provides student-centric and faculty-centric services to our university partners. These services include, but are not limited to: embedded ""academic coaching"" (online teaching assistant) support, hybrid course coaching, tutoring, supplemental instruction, faculty recruitment, face to face observations, and other support of students in specific degree programs. Our services help meet the needs that universities face with 21st Century accredited online degree programs and courses. As a sole source, and the first company in the U.S. to scale the use of ""academic coaches"" into high quality, live, asynchronous online, accredited courses and degree programs in traditional universities, Instructional Connections has helped thousands of students earn degrees and credit. Many students credit their ""coaches"" with their successful completion of a degree program.

Members of Splitflix can split the cost of a Netflix or Hulu Plus account, or both accounts for that matter. We provide the platform and manage the process of introducing our members to one another anonymously and securely so they can enjoy the benefits of dual membership to a singe account. We also give each member a shared email address and generic login/password to be used in the establishment of a truly mutually beneficial and secure Netflix or Hulu Plus account.      Their membership term is based solely on the the amount of time they select to share with one another. For example, if a member decides they would like 6 months of access to Netflix with another one of Splitflix users, they pay $.99 per month for 6 months (This money goes to Splitflix and is in addition to the monthly fees charged by Netflix and Hulu Plus). To be fair to one another, there is no cancellation before the term they select, this allows for an uninterupted viewing experience without worries of termination.","Information Technology, Internet Services, Messaging and Telecommunications",1,Todd Mancini,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
