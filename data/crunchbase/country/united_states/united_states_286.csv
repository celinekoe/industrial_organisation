Yet, unlike utilities, the homeowner manages a water heater, always out of sight and out of mind until it breaks. Then being in a rush for replacement, dealing with high costs and warranties, and finding a plumber that can do it that day. If you are lucky, you don't have a catastrophic failure flooding your home and then dealing with the insurance company. I am sure we all had a broken water heater at one point in life. The Torii Way simplifies this by using a subscription-based model to lower the upfront cost of turning a CAPEX into an OPEX. The Torii water heater uses sensors with predictive analytics for failure. Replacing the unit before failure at no extra cost and scheduling the customer and plumber to swap a unit.",,2,"Gordon Olson, John Hynds",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
