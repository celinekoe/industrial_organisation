They are a Nevada company that plans to establish a company to manage global full risk contracts between provider organizations and health plans across the nation. Through the Affordable Care Act the federal government, along with many state governments, is aggressively promoting the passing of health care insurance risk from health plans and MCOs to provider organizations. Evidence of this is the Medicare Shared Savings program, through contracts with Accountable Care Organizations. State governments have undertaken waivered Medicaid redesign programs, with New York being the most aggressive. In New York it is called the DSRIP program. In the waiver approved by CMS, the state has promised that 90% of ALL provider payments in the Medicaid program will be value based. The goal stated in the program documents is to have providers at risk for their services. RIM has formed a relationship with a consulting firm that has a healthcare division, and is actively working to gain access to PPSs, the provider organizations formed under the DSRIP program, to manage their risk contracts.       RIM has begun reaching out to physician owned IPA who are seeking to enter into full risk contracts with health plans. RIM will supply the management expertise to manage the risk successfully in long term contracts of 20 years or more. RIM will poll the primary care providers in the IPA and determine the health plan that has the most members in the PCP practices. RIM will then approach the plan to acquire a global risk contract. RIM Healthcare Strategies, INC has formed relationships with several Faith Based denomination’s leadership. It has proposed to set up an IPA/ACO in New York City that would be owned by the Faith Based organizations. RIM will contract with a Medicare Advantage Plan (MAPD) on a full risk basis.",Health Care,,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
