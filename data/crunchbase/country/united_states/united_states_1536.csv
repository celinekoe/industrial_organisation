Community Access was first operated out of the Executive Director, Sidney Blanchard’s, Volkswagen Beetle. The agency soon moved into a small office and continued to grow.  In 1984, CAU added supports for youth in New Jersey’s child welfare system and parents with disabilities through the provision of supportive transitional living programs and educational training. In 1987, CAU secured its first housing units. In 1992, CAU moved to its current location at 80 West Grand Street in Elizabeth. Today, in addition to 64,000 square feet of commercial space, CAU owns more than 235 units of housing throughout Union County. CAU was one of the first nonprofits in the nation to pursue the federal low-income housing tax credit to acquire property.  CAU was founded as a social service movement to capture resources to build community support systems for all people living in need that live in the community. We see issues facing people with disabilities as community issues: safe and affordable housing, employment, social activities, political involvement and advocacy.

We are drawing awareness to the Qur’an’s message of gender equality and Islam’s principle of peace. We are paving the way towards a world in which every woman can raise her head without fear of being attacked for her gender or beliefs. We write articles that relate to young modern women all over the globe and kickstart an open honest dialogue about Islam in today’s society. Here at MuslimGirl we like to talk about things that might be a little too embarrassing for mom, to bridge the gap between different religions through the spirit of sisterhood, and to host interfaith discussion to combat growing stereotypes within our society and tackle social issues that may otherwise be shied away from. We are pioneering our own paths as Muslim women living in today’s modern society, and this is our story.","Community and Lifestyle, Content and Publishing, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Other, Social Impact",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Right from the start, they have been at the forefront of circuit miniaturization technology. Their initial products were high-density resistor networks for scientific research applications at universities and other research institutions. From these networks, thick and thin film ceramic hybrid circuit assemblies were a natural growth step. In the mid 1970s they helped pioneer a new technology called Chip On Board (COB) and various Multi Chip Module (MCM) designations. COB formed the initial basic step that led to today’s Ball Grid Array (BGA) technology. In 1975, Argo became involved in the design and manufacture of high quality miniaturized electronic circuits for a broad range of industries. As active Surface Mount components began to appear in the 1980’s, we saw the possibilities and developed processes to capture this new technology for PCB assembly, while maintaining their position as a leading manufacturer of electronic assemblies. They installed new equipment for solder paste screening, automatic component placement, reflow soldering and assembly cleaning. They helped pioneer the fusion of these technologies to produce circuit layouts designed for size and cost optimization. In 2002, Argo became the first ISO 9000 registered electronic assembly manufacturer in Connecticut. They followed that milestone with the installation of a third SMT line, an automated optical inspection system and a reflow technology upgrade.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Manufacturing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

We were amazed at how many people in a transaction, tenant, broker, landlord, all mentioned deposits and financial worthiness as massive friction points in a deal. We saw how cash deposits felt wasteful, losing money against inflation! We heard about how letters of credit required onerous provisions that essentially locked a businesses cash up anyway…so we built a better solution. The Otso Guarantee. We formed Otso to solve a real problem with the way commercial leasing assesses credit, mitigates risk and ultimately stockpiles capital in “dead” accounts that loses money for everyone.  Our program is built to provide Tenants with the flexibility to access and leverage their capital on day one of their lease, for anything…from a nicer space to more equipment and hiring. For Landlords, it made little to no sense to use critical cash for a business to mitigate risk years down the road…and to be frank, it doesn’t do much to mitigate that risk anyway. Our program issues “same as cash” guarantees for our approved tenants that give Landlords comfort while providing their Tenants with a greater lease experience, right from the start. As we grow, Otso will blend into a larger vision we hold at Tenavox, where friction is reduced and transparency allows for quicker, better lease decisions for everyone.","Financial Services, Real Estate",3,"Frank Rogers, Josh Feinberg, Marissa Limsiaco",1-10,2,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,"Quake Capital Partners, Second Century Ventures, Sputnik ATX, RealCoAccelerator",1,4,,Private,,,,,,
