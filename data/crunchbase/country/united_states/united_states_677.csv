The program is aimed at helping the chronically ill and/or physically disabled individuals by allowing the person to hire an assistant of their choosing. This helps to ensure that a friendly face is around for assistance. The best part of all is that it is of no cost to the consumer and the assistant will be paid. Recipients have flexibility and freedom in choosing their caregivers. In February, 2017, Home Choice LLC was opened as a CDPAP provider to help make access to the program easier for everyone and we have high hopes that this program will aid everyone who needs it. Our goal is to ensure that all individuals who are eligible for the service are informed about it and have access to it. My office is fully dedicated to serving your home care needs. To find out more about the program or to see if you are eligible, please feel free to contact our office at: (718) 513-6641.
