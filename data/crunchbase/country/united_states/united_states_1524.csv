Since then the company has expanded and attained even more success thanks to the work of its small and devoted team, including Bill Gaffney (founder), three full-time brokers, and an administrative marketing coordinator. Change Realty has helped people save millions of dollars over the years. The company climbs the ranks in terms of sales and growth every year and in both 2014 and 2015 it made the Portland Business Journal's prestigious top 100 list of fastest-growing private companies. Another reason Change Realty stands out is that the team understands the fast-paced, changing world we live in, and how real estate must be integrated with today's technology. That's why in addition to the timely listings and expert selling and buying, Change Realty creates websites for every individual property. Since 2009 the company has made waves and redefined what it means to be a successful brokerage firm, all while saving money for clients and helping them retain equity from their sales.","Professional Services, Real Estate",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
