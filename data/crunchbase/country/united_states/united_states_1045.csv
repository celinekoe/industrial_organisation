We believe that choosing foods from plant sources is one of the best things we can do for ourselves, the environment, and for animals.  Replacing animal foods with plant foods reduces the animal suffering and environmental destruction that result from animal agriculture.  It is a meaningful way to help make a better world and to feel good about how we live our lives. At the same time, we remove foods that have been linked with serious health problems, and replace them with beneficial plant foods that contribute to good health. BVS organizes an active schedule of educational, outreach, and community building events (read about them on our Events & Activities page). We also organize the annual Boston Veg Food Fest, one of the largest vegan events in the world. We encourage non-vegetarians and vegetarians alike to join us as we learn and share information, friendship, and community in carrying out our Mission.

Dallas, Texas will be the headquarters for Entrepreneur Education Management Corporation. Research shows that this market offers the perfect mix of opportunities and the types of business mindsets that will mesh extremely well with our vision. While Dallas will be the initial point of market entry, we intend to expand and open similar educational facilities in the top 20 markets in the U.S. Our plans call for us to aggressively target the younger demographic as they have lived through the recession and their views on employment have in many ways been shaped by it. This is a promising factor because a large section of this demographic has begun to question the value of a traditional college education. In lieu of four or five years being spent on a college campus, they have shown a want to forge their own paths through small business ownership. With that being said our organization will look to develop a marketing message that deeply resonates with them.
