At the moment, we focus on uncovering insights within muscle activity data. Before, there was always a tradeoff between speed of analysis and depth of insights. This limited the potential of muscle activity data in practical applications.  We’ve uncovered a way to speak to the muscles and get in depth information into specificity, intensity, and volume of training straight from the source of performance.  Instead of proxies for internal load, we get data straight from the muscles. This reduces the margin of error of training assumptions by ~30%.  Then, we quantify and visualize training stimulus and fatigue so that coaches can rapidly test assumptions and adapt their programs to their athletes’ needs.  Coaches can now create a constant feedback loop between them and their athletes’ muscles to catch risky actions before they affect performance, or worse, lead to injury.",,2,"Hobey Tam, Tanya Colonna",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
