My houses have shipped from Texas to the Badlands of North Dakota, and other states besides all over Texas. The next step is building an entire town from 95% Pure Salvage and no imports. The process, once started with a bit more capital invested, will soon fund it self through using the houses that they build for staying overnight, income streams from seminars and retreats to teach this ideology, as well as detox and healthy get aways from the city. They will have a chapel for weddings, buildings for events, car rallies, bike rallies, and other draws that will be possible with the opening of the market in the middle of the 43 acres I am developing for this model. Once built, it will provide a venue for music events, organic and American based market for all things old, organic, and made from salvage.   They have an audio and video recording studio to develop the publishing side of the business, a restaurant to service the events with concessions, houses already in place, materials in stock to build 75-100 more houses and the full market place in stock and paid for, and the land already set up with utilities, sewer, city water, but not the limitations of having been annexed on the bulk of the property I want to develop.   They have a relatively bureaucracy free environment to work in, being an unincorporated town they could still become incorporated, thus also be able to collect taxes, have a police force, and use the power of variances to create models no one else can to show that Tiny House villages and towns are viable solutions to the coming transition of millions into retirement without the style of living they have become accustomed to.

Their founder, Chris Leedom, had worked as a consultant with thousands of small to medium sized business owners from across the country. During this time he observed many clients that were simply ignored by “big box” credit card and ACH processors and banks. As a serial entrepreneur with several successful start-ups he saw opportunity. Paymaxx Pro’s first product was ACH Collector. This product was designed to process recurring and one-time ACH payments. Based on ease of use and exceptional service, clients asked us to handle their credit card processing. So they did. Then they asked us to provide other world class payment processing solutions like secure web-pay portals, pay-by-phone solutions and text-to-pay capabilities and reminders. The bottom line is these products are best in class because they have been developed 100% by their in-house technology team. Every product they offer was built from the ground up based on the unique needs and specifications of their merchant-clients. Additionally the Paymaxx Pro suite of solutions is integrated with many software providers, serving different industries such as automotive, insurance, and similar industries where there is a high-volume of single and recurring payments. Chances are if you process payments, they can help you handle any volume more efficiently. From their first payment transaction in 2005 to today they have processed billions of dollars in credit card and ACH payments. As a result of their high-volume and direct access as a registered ISO, they are able to provide the most competitive pricing for their clients. Their goal is to offer a suite of cutting edge payment processing solutions coupled with the best service in the industry. That is why they have been recognized with award after award.

All we are missing are the funds to take this to the next level. We believe that the government should provide an education to its people, and now is the time to truly make a change to better our broken system. You often talk about school choice and funding opportunities for all students. I realize that you had intentions of providing funding for home school families. They aren’t interested in receiving direct funding from the government. Our organization serves all families regardless of school choice. We provide support to everyone. We have been erasing the lines of restrictions since we were created in 2006. The New Heights Educational Group, Inc. promotes literacy for children and adults, by offering a range of educational support services. Such services include: assisting families in the selection of schools; organization of educational activities; and acquisition of materials.   We promote a healthy learning environment and enrichment programs for families of preschool and school-age children, including children with special needs. Here is a brief history of our organization: New Heights Educational Group (NHEG) was created on June 1, 2006 and has grown by leaps and bounds since its inception. In exploring home schooling, charter schools, and local public school settings for her children, Mrs. Pamela Clark, Founder/Director, not only found strengths and weaknesses in these systems but she also encountered other families wanting to improve children’s educational experiences. Mrs. Clark discovered that these families were able to help each other, especially in regard to understanding how to teach children with learning difficulties such ADHD, Bi-Polar disorder, Autism, neurological disorders, and processing disorders. In addition to more successful child-focused learning techniques, families were able to cope with their children’s struggles better because of increased social support. This experience gave credibility to Mrs. Clark’s vision of having a Resource and Literacy Center that would function as a place for families to come for educational help and support. At NHEG, we provide fill-in-the-gap, one-on-one tutoring, for youth and adults. All teachers and students are required to meet three hours a week over a three-day period. We found that fill-in-the-gap style tutoring is necessary in order to reach students who have been left behind in traditional settings. NHEG has grown and has been able to clearly define a literacy program that is suited for all ages. In order to promote leadership, we offer a Student Advisory Group for students aged 7 to 13 and a Student Leadership Council for students aged 14 to 23 with a GPA of at least 3.0. This gives them internship opportunities to serve in our organization and earn relevant experience. It also empowers them to make a difference. Additionally, NHEG offers an Adult Advisory Group for parents, which provides an outlet for adults to have a voice on improving education. These are National Leadership Opportunities, and we have students from Arizona, Washington State, New York, and Ohio. Mrs. Pamela Clark has a passion for bettering education and leads a team of over 70 volunteers at NHEG. She constantly researches latest advancements, provides guidance to tutors, monitors evaluations, and provides training and resources to teachers for different learning styles. We also now offer a bi-monthly educational magazine with over 64,000 views and all new bi-monthly comic book. We have also grown our educational internet radio program; with a total number of listeners of over 214,000 since inception. Our first book, titled One Nonprofit's Journey to Success, was published in 2015. We published another book in November 2016, titled Unraveling Reading, which is the first in a series. Some of our students were on the verge of dropping out of high school before they received tutoring from NHEG and have now graduated. A student, who had suffered from seizures at a young age, was able to jump three grade levels in science and four grade levels in math in a little over a year after receiving tutoring from NHEG. We have helped students find online and in-person colleges, provided scholarship information, and prepared transcripts and diplomas for those in alternative schools. NHEG has also helped adults with obtaining a GED or tutoring. We are truly a one-stop shop in education. New Heights Educational Group is an award winning organization, with over 36 awards and recognition since inception. We invite you to have a discussion about this and learn more about what we are doing to improve educational choices for all people.
