BioNimbus allows for the real time gathering and analysis of discrete data emanating from the human body in response to varied stimuli through sensors or mobile wearables. The BioNimbus technology can be applied to anything that can be sensed (e.g. sound, smell, a human interaction, etc.) and the test outcome can be appropriately designed. BioNimbus is a powerful economic disruptive force, delivering similar or better analysis to the customer faster and at costs of $300 CPI (Cost per Interview) rather than $500 to $800 CPI. Using political analysis as an example, the BioNimbus technology conducted a study in October of 2016 with faculty members of the Texas Tech the College of Media and Communications. The study investigated what genuinely causes the hard-to-move undecided voters in elections to “budge”. Budging is defined as the act of finally moving an implacable undecided definitively toward a specific candidate. The stimuli used were specific candidate inflections (eleven primary inflections). BioNimbus’ AI tools analyzed the impulse data inflections most strongly statistically correlated with “budging”. The results of the study were almost identical, in terms of voter percentage, to the national election results. The BioNimbus technology has already been applied to Consumer Packaging (“CPG”) projects. BioNimbus enables rapid testing of design concepts allowing companies to determine suitability and engagement by users and consumers at all stages of a product life cycle. It is a powerful risk management tool for a company providing insights at the stages (i.e. design, concept, prototype) when it is more economic to make product changes. A client has a great deal of control with BioNimbus with the ability to set up tests and receive analysis of data in a dashboard format. BioNimbus has applicability for a wide range of vertical markets. Aside from political analysis and CPG, other markets include education (i.e. engagement testing of content preparation), law enforcement and corrections (i.e. surveys and training of proper procedures) healthcare (i.e. labeling, protocol training) and government (i.e. armed forces training).  Technology development and initial product trials to date has been funded internally by Cascade Strategies. Cascade Strategies is moving ahead to roll out the applications of the BioNimbus technology establishing partnerships involving analytics and operations partners, market research companies (sample providers, research services) and Product Lifecycle Management companies (major established and emerging design companies).","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Biotechnology, Consumer Electronics, Data and Analytics, Design, Government and Military, Hardware, Science and Engineering, Software",1,Jerry Johnson,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
