It makes absolutely no difference where in the world they are or how long do they talk: calls come at no cost for Ring2Skype users.In order to use Ring2Skype, No credit card information or software download are necessary. You just need a Skype account, select the city where you want the number (there are currently more than 100 options), and Ring2Skype sends the number to your email. That is it.So how is this company able to offer the service for free? How do they plan  to make money? In their words: ""We have been working and investing in telcoms in the last decade and, through proprietary technology, we are able to offer this service at almost no cost for our company. This is how we do it: We give each user a local phone number plus a private extension. In this way, we absorb the cost of each line by 990 extensions, and that is why we are able to offer the service at absolutely no cost to our users. Just like Twitter or Facebook in their beginnings, we don't have a defined business model yet, but we do have a strategy: the service is and will remain free to our customers. Since we are able to do this at almost no significant cost for us, we are very excited about the different revenue paths that may appear as we continue to grow.""","Hardware, Information Technology, Internet Services, Messaging and Telecommunications, Mobile, Sales and Marketing",2,"Andrés Bzurovski, Sergio Fogel",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

It leverages a new application of the fundamentals of science, Real-Time Modeling and Machine Control, to improve compressor performance while reducing its energy footprint. This approach is a fundamentally different method of operation than traditional compressor control systems. It is an edge computing solution that leverages computing power embedded into sensors to sense and receive precision feedback to build a 360* real-time model.  This model is employed to perform optimal control based purely on the physics of the air compressor machine and process.  The competitive advantage lies in the proprietary computing methodology used to perform the real-time feedback, data analysis and modeling. Conceptually, the Compressor Controller works through sensors and actuators (device to assist in machine operation) that feed into and are controlled by a working model. The model receives synchronized sensor input on the environment and the machine operation to constantly calculate and implement the optimal actuation in the moment. This model-based approach allows the control system to always compare the actual compressor operation against the scientific ideal and automatically implement the necessary adjustments accordingly. The result is a compressor that always improves its performance, consuming less energy, while securely providing access to an entirely new layer of machine operating and performance data.

Successful to date in its fundamental mission, AG is a multi-award winning publication and its columnists and editors are named as some of the most influential in real estate, business, and in technology. AG is known for ripping the lid off of hot new technologies, startups, and mashups- everyone knows that if it’s on AG, it’s relevant.  In late 2009, AG took on News, seeking to disrupt a drab and boring, and mostly pay to play publishing space and continues to bring honest coverage and insight to an eager audience. Because of AG’s footprint within the tech startup space and in the business category, we needed a way to expand our publication, and in 2011, we changed our masthead to AGBeat, launching a brand around Agent/Genius.","Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Real Estate",1,Benn Rosales,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Our approach to the study of games is based on a simple idea: games matter. Just like other cultural forms – music, film, literature, painting, dance, theater – games are valuable for their own sake. Games are worth studying, not merely as artifacts of advanced digital technology, or for their potential to educate, or as products within a thriving global industry, but in and of themselves, as experiences that entertain us, move us, explore complex topics, communicate profound ideas, and illuminate elusive truths about ourselves, the world around us, and each other. The Game Center was established in 2008, and is housed at the Tisch School of the Arts in the Skirball Center for New Media. We work in close collaboration with other NYU schools and departments including the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development, and NYU Poly. Our goal is to incubate new ideas, create partnerships, and establish a multi-school curriculum to explore new directions for the creative development and critical understanding of games. We are also active supporters of the New York City game development scene and seek to help establish New York as a place of innovation and creativity within this important field. The mission of the Center is to graduate the next generation of game designers, developers, entrepreneurs, and critics, and to advance the art, science and culture of gaming by creating a context for advanced study and innovative work. The Center’s students, both undergraduates and graduates, will be drawn from diverse disciplines including computer programming, visual art, sound and audio, animation, writing, and joined together by the central discipline of game design.","Education, Software",,,10001+,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
