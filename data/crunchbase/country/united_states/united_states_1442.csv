Think of the incredible results you see from Orange Theory and P90X refined by the personalization and attention to detail you can only find in a high end yoga studio. All of this, with no hidden fees and no contracts. With these principles in place, our no nonsense just ""Fitness to the Core"" mantra was born. The health and fitness industry is riddled with horror stories from consumers paying for results and receiving none. The unfortunate reality is, they suffer by default because the industry is designed to capitalize on their ignorance. Core5 Studio sheds light on the path to their goals. In a traditional health club, trainers and group instructors naturally work against one another. Trainers are only compensated when they are in a session with a client while instructors are only compensated based on class participation. Neither benefits from the idea of synergy. Neither bothers to recommend the other's services and the only person suffering is the client. While this issue plagues the industry, at Core5 we have put together a model that THRIVES off of that synergy. Our client's overall health and results are the only focus. Our staff strive to bridge the gap for every client, in every session. Just show up and we take care of the rest.","Health Care, Professional Services, Sports",,,11-50,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

As a graduate student, I created my own website It was an excellent website, but visitors were low I started by going to an SEO forum and asking questions, answering questions, and reading various posts to keep on top of Twitter, facebook, and Reddit. My interest was piqued quickly. The course taught me how to create fantastic content and promote it so people would link to it and use it. This website receives thousands of visitors every day. My website's search presence was also improved. I was pursuing my college studies in 2011. Every day, I spent 18 hours on Blogging sites, Reddit, Quora, and SEO forums. As blogging and digital journalism were topics that few people seemed to understand, I became interested in them.  I read everything about blogging, SEO, digital journalism, or Google ranking. My comfort level with giving advice grew over time. Soon after, I was requested to look through their websites. I made a report to look through a site's metrics and give my thoughts on which factors were most likely affecting it. My inbox was full of help requests. Then I started writing for Quora, Reddit, and Offline. Soon, I was in high demand among my friends. For the most part, I was able to pass on this work to others.  My experience includes working with a wide variety of website creators. Working with newbies and small blogs is what I enjoy the most. I have enjoyed working with them. Today, I write, blog, do digital journalism, create content, review, and advise. I love it so much! check out our editorial guidelines by clicking here What is my highest Education qualification?

The first solution is an intelligent search engine to help identify possible ways to substitute medications when cheaper non-inferior ones are available. This search combines therapeutic equivalence with pricing information. This is particularly useful for patients who may be on a brand name and unaware of a therapeutic equivalent. Patients can save their medications and receive alerts when prices change hopefully keeping the affect on their pocket a minimum.  Secondly, they offer an evidence backed recommendation engine which helps patients identify what medications they should be on based on their health conditions, gender, and age. This is novel (at least at the consumer level). This can be used to make sure patients are taking the what the most recent research recommends. This can help the average person figure what medications they should be taking which can sometimes be left of off their medication regimen in the process of trying to navigate the confusing health care system we partake in.  Thirdly, they offer a comprehensive reminder system.  They offer reminders through SMS, phone calls, email, and IM (MSN, Yahoo, GTalk, etc.). The service is available to the international community though local numbers in over 100 countries and offer two way communication. Offering local numbers makes it easy for people in their respective countries to respond without incurring high costs. THey offer ways to track medication and also offer proxy monitoring.
