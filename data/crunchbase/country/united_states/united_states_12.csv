Since 1985, CONNECT has assisted in the formation and development of more than 3,000 companies. The leadership of CONNECT attributes its success to the unique culture of collaboration between industry, capital sources, professional service providers and research organizations that CONNECT has sought to foster in the region. CONNECT was originally founded as a part of the University of California (UC) San Diego in the mid-80s.  At that time traditional industries in the region were on the decline, the attraction of companies to the San Diego region was very difficult and region leaders were searching for a path to economic renewal and sustained growth. Meanwhile, innovative high tech and life sciences companies such as IMED, IVAC, Linkabit, SAIC, Qualcomm and Hybritech were quietly developing in the San Diego region, fueled in part by technology and scientists at research institutions on the Torrey Pines Mesa.  UC San Diego, the San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation and private sector business leaders recognized in this an opportunity for CONNECT to transform San Diego’s growing research capabilities into commercially viable products and businesses that would ultimately increase the prosperity of the region. By leveraging the various assets within the region, CONNECT focuses its efforts on accelerating the commercialization of new technology and life sciences products. While that mission has stayed relatively true since its initial creation, the organization and its program offerings have continued to evolve in response to the changes in the region’s economic climate. At the time that CONNECT was being founded, UC San Diego was just beginning to mature as a research institution, and there were a small number of other research institutions in the region. Over the years as San Diego’s technology and life sciences clusters have matured, UC San Diego has continued to grow, and in tandem, so has the entire research base of the region.  Today, San Diego has more than 80 research institutions; about two thirds are part of the UC San Diego system, and the rest include private research organizations and a number of other academic-based research institutions. In 2005, to better serve the entire research community, CONNECT spun-out of UC San Diego and formed the CONNECT Association, a 501c6 trade organization and CONNECT Foundation, a 501c3 charitable foundation.  As a result of spinning-out from UC San Diego, CONNECT has been able to broaden its mandate to include public advocacy work on behalf of its members through the trade organization. Today, CONNECT is focused on delivering the fundamental programs that the innovation community depends upon.  At the same time the organization is creating new services to meet the needs of the evolving economic and policy landscape and the new clusters that are developing within the region.  Challenges include attracting investment capital and engineering and experienced management talent. The organization views its “sweet-spot” as the “beginning of the food chain” – the point when the market potential of an innovation is being assessed and then commercialized.  Toward this end, CONNECT works with innovators in research institutions, early stage and growth companies and major corporations.  Whether a company is looking to spin out or license an innovation, launch a second or third product into a new market or evaluate the commercial potential of a discovery CONNECT has experienced entrepreneurs-in-residence who can assess the innovation and coach the innovators through the process. Throughout the last quarter of a century CONNECT has assisted clusters in developing their own trade organizations as they become large enough and deep enough to sustain a stand-alone organization focused on the cluster’s specific technical needs.  Organizations that CONNECT has assisted in fostering over the years include BIOCOM, CommNexus San Diego, CleanTECH San Diego and Wireless Life Sciences Alliance.  CONNECT either creates or participates in the creation of a cluster trade organization as the cluster evolves and grows within the region.  It is currently partnering in the creation of a biomimicry proof of concept center that will lead to the development of biomimicry clusters across the US.  In addition it is incubating an action and sports organization led by NBA legend Bill Walton called SD Sport Innovators to focus on the advanced technologies found within the sporting industry such as high performance materials and designs, clean technology and wireless and remote monitoring. Continual development of new strategies by the board of directors and staff leadership team to meet the evolving needs of the innovation economy keeps CONNECT relevant to its members.  It has enabled the organization to deliver measurable results to the companies served, even in the midst of the recent recession.  In addition, the organization recognizes that each member company or organization is unique.  Therefore, the staff works to tailor its programming and individual assistance in order to ensure these specific needs are being met.   This approach has led to a stable base of membership that grows consistently each year. CONNECT’s annual budget is approximately $3 million.  About half of the organization’s revenue is primarily generated from membership dues paid by industry, professional service providers, research institutions and venture capital firms.  Members provide additional sponsorship revenue for individual programs.  This base of revenue enables CONNECT to provide mentoring and educational programming either free or at a very low cost for researchers and early and growth stage companies.  The revenue from ticket and table sales, along with a small number of grants mainly from private foundations makes up the balance of CONNECT’s budget. As a result of its efforts, CONNECT has assisted more than 3,000 companies in attracting more than $2 billion in investment capital.  CONNECT is widely regarded as one of the world’s most successful organizations linking inventors and entrepreneurs with the resources they need for commercialization of innovative products.The program has been modeled in more than 50 regions around the world – most recently in New York City, Bogotá, Colombia and Saudi Arabia. CONNECT has recently been recognized by Inc., Time and Entrepreneur magazines and received the 2010 Innovation in Economic Development Award from the U.S. Department of Commerce for creation of Regional Innovation Clusters.  CONNECT also manages the San Diego Innovation Hub (iHub) designated by the state of California Governor’s Office of Economic Development in 2010.","Biotechnology, Community and Lifestyle, Other, Science and Engineering, Social Impact",1,Irwin Jacobs,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

They understand the untold challenges everyone faces in their quest to make good choices, especially when it comes to leveraging lots of opinions. Digesting these opinions, however, is now beyond any one person’s capacity. And the volume grows faster than the marketplace’s ability to adapt. The Challenge How do travelers decide where to go? Which place to stay? What to say, post, tweet? The answers keep everyone at TrustYou busy all day and up all night! Opinions now rank #1 in influencing travelers’ selections and industry reputations.  Each day things become more complicated because millions of new opinions in thousands of formats and dozens of languages enter the fray. And TripAdvisor only represents 25% of today’s reviews worldwide. Numerous sources contain valuable information, including relevant user-generated reviews, blog posts, tweets, Facebook likes, discussions, comments, Instagram pics, Pinterest bookmarks, etc. How It Works TrustYou searches, analyzes and distills hundreds of millions of opinions scattered across a vast, fragmented market. Their software as a service (SaaS) technology is sophisticated; their products are simple. TrustYou’s unique semantic engine analyzes this treasure trove of disorganized content.

Pelago's mission is to remove all barriers to inspiration, information and human connection. Pelago's most recent product, Whrrl v2.0, enables storytelling in our daily lives. Launched in March, 2009, it is a mobile and Web application that enables people to capture and share the moments of their lives, as they happen, in story form. Through location, photos and text updates, users can easily turn everyday life experiences into lasting stories that can be remembered, organized and shared. The user controls exactly who can see his or her story, ranging from total privacy to publicly visible, including optional broadcast via status updates on Facebook and Twitter. Whrrl v2.0 is available now as a free application through the iPhone App Store, and anyone can participate via the Web, SMS text, and digital cameras with an Eye-Fi wifi-enabled memory card. Whrrl v2.0 stories are collaborative: two or more people who are physically together can â€œjoinâ€ and contribute to the same story from their separate phones, allowing a single shared experience to be expressed from multiple points of view. In addition, each story has its own unique URL that can be easily shared. After the real-world experience ends, the story may be edited by the participants via the Whrrl website and shared with others through Facebook, Twitter and/or email. Whrrl v2.0 on the iPhone utilizes Facebook Connect for Mobile to allow Facebook users to bypass Whrrl v2.0 account creation and login with their Facebook accounts. Linking a Facebook account to Whrrl v2.0 also enables access to the userâ€™s Facebook friends list, ability to publish stories as status updates, and all photos taken through Whrrl can be automatically published to Facebook photos. For non-iPhone users, Pelago provides several ways to participate in Whrrl v2.0. First, any mobile phone user can create and update stories by sending SMS text and email messages. Second, people who own a digital camera and an Eye-Fi wireless wifi-enabled memory card can upload pictures taken with the camera in real-time to a Whrrl v2.0 story.

WIN franchisees have strong income potential, distinctive brand awareness, and a proven business system. WIN Home Inspection (WIN) was founded in 1993 in Seattle, Washington, and thus far has developed into a network of more than 240 locations in 44 states. WIN has been the fastest-growing home inspection franchise and is rated among the Top-100 Franchises nationally. WIN offers comprehensive training programs, innovative marketing, and exceptional support. WIN has the largest per capita team in the home service franchise with a support staff of 35 and growing. With over 126 million households in the US, and 7 million homes bought and sold every year, the necessity and sheer size of the home inspection industry make it recession resistant. With WIN's business model, entrepreneurs can quickly launch their business without needing inventory, office space, or storefront. WIN is a home-based business and a low-cost franchise, with start-up costs that begin at $35,850 (which can be even lower for veterans). In 2021, 44% of WIN franchises were open for more than one year, reported Gross Revenue for all 12 months, and had an annual Gross Revenue of more than $100,000. Of those franchises, 35% met or exceeded the average Gross Revenue of $265,760. WIN has been rated the most innovative home services company in the U.S. and for good reason. WIN's proprietary software helps inspectors perform a consistent inspection, guiding them through the various parts of the home, providing checklists of items to inspect and allowing the inspector to make notes that are incorporated into their home inspection report. The software streamlines the inspection process and makes it faster and easier to generate reports, saving inspectors time, which helps them complete more jobs and earn more money. Franchise owners also undergo extensive classroom and field training and can get licensed with the FAA to be drone pilots. WIN heavily invests in building innovative tools and technologies to provide a better user experience for inspectors and clients. With AI-driven cloud services and proprietary systems and services, you can do more with WIN. WIN Home Inspection was started in order to create a home inspection franchise that would offer homeowners, buyers, sellers and real estate agents a professional, thorough and consistent inspection process. They believe home inspections should provide clarity, confidence and peace of mind, not anxiety. Many WIN Home Inspection franchise owners earn referrals from real estate agents, which in turn leads to higher revenues and profits. Their strong, professional brand is the first thing a client notices. When a WIN inspector arrives for an inspection, they pull up in a white van, SUV or crossover vehicle branded in WIN colors and with the WIN logo, and greet the client dressed in a WIN-branded polo. Inspectors tote a tablet or convertible PC that is used to perform the inspection. Everything about our inspectors' appearance and demeanor is designed to be welcoming, crisp and professional. All franchise owners are backed by the largest support team in the home inspection industry. With experts specializing in training and development, marketing, and technology and infrastructure, you can launch and run your business with confidence. WIN also has an extensive peer mentorship network, where you can receive ongoing coaching and guidance from seasoned owners. While performing inspections, WIN home inspectors take the time to educate home buyers about their new home because they care about their overall health and wellbeing. Showing them where the main water line shut-off valve and electrical panel are located and how to operate water heaters and HVAC units are just a few of the ways WIN home inspectors go the extra mile for their clients. WIN Home Inspection has a commitment to assist American Veterans who have a desire to own their own business with the “WIN for America” Veterans Program. This program is a unique opportunity for Veterans to take advantage of reduced franchise fees and special financing options.",Real Estate,4,"Dianne Knapp, Geoff Wilson, Praful Mittal, Thomas Knapp",101-250,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
