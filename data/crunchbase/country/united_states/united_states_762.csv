The team at GivnGo has one major motive, which is to make the world a better place by allowing charitable donations to be a part of everyday life. Their ideology is simple: “By sharing your spare change, you can make the world change.” Within the GivnGo app, there are many donation options including one time donations and a monthly recurring option as well. The featured function of the app is called “Round Ups,” which allows users to give back to charity every time they make a purchase by donating their spare change. Users can start “round ups” by linking their main card of purchase (credit or debit) and  also entering their corresponding bank information. You can set monthly limits on how much you donate by adjusting contributions to your own specificity. There is a  $5, $10, $20, and  “no max” setting which caps off the amount given every month, based on whatever a user wants set as their monthly maximum. Watch the pot of gold animation  increase as you give, and see how a little change, can make a big difference for others! The creators for the app like to refer to the the spare change donated as “Karma Coins” (TM). With the GivnGo app every time you shop for some new clothes, buy something to eat, or fill up your gas tank, you are also making an impact on others. This allows you to truly, give and go!","Financial Services, Other, Social Impact",2,"Arian Behboodi, Zach Darwish",1-10,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
