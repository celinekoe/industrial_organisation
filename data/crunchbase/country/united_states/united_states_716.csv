The story of Cloudtools actually begins earlier at Virtual Bridges, an established player in the virtualization space and the source company from which Cloudtools spun out. At the time, Virtual Bridges was bringing a new product to market, a cloud orchestration solution for orchestrating workloads in multi-cloud environments. During the development period they ran into the same roadblock that Cloudtools customers encounter every day: the time-consuming and difficult task of moving a virtual machine from one environment to another. Virtual Machine movement has been next to impossible yet it is a problem affecting any administrator who has a need to move to a different virtualization platform. We had an advantage when it came to dealing with this roadblock: our development team was dev-ops focused. We had developers who approached this problem with a deep understanding of the operational aspects of virtualization, and had first-hand experience dealing with real-world virtualization problems such as moving VMs. At this point we decided to solve the movement problem once and for all. This is when we formed Cloudtools and created Shift, the drag and drop solution that lets you move any virtualized machine from anywhere to anywhere. Shift is our first product to market that helps to solve the tough problems faced by cloud and virtualization administrators every day. Whether you need a tool that lets you switch to AWS, switch to Hyper-V, switch to Azure or you are having problems or issues with VMware or just want to move to the cloud, Cloudtools has developed the solution to help you. At Cloudtools, our mission is simple: We make tools that let IT professionals spend a few minutes handling tasks that would otherwise take hours or days.","Hardware, Information Technology, Internet Services, Software",2,"Kelly Jones, Ph.D., Sam Cece",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

FlightPartner aggregates global charter aircraft availability and brings that availability to the marketplace through scheduling systems integration and an easy to use cloud-based customer workflow platform. What makes us different than other solutions? With a team of aviation information technology professionals, we are addressing a fragmented air charter industry with poor conversion to sales. Current expensive solutions have flooded the marketplace with request for quotes (RFQ’s) with little expectation of the quote converting to a sale.  We are vetting the charter request process and bringing the sale to the charter operator.  We are able to accomplish this at a fraction of the cost of the largest marketplace. How much does it cost? Our air charter operators can provide access to their aircraft fleet at no cost.   How do we make money? We charge a small transaction front end fee to the broker when the air charter sale is closed.  Unlike other solutions where you incur a subscription fee whether they bring you sales or not, when you make money, we receive a small transaction fee.","Software, Transportation, Travel and Tourism",1,Douglas Schmohl,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

As 2009 drew to a close, they determined they could and should become more. They believe it is time for a community institution dedicated to serving the local geek community. That means providing a facility for work and events to happen. That means building more programs and events to host in that facility. That means networking with the geeks around us to do all of this in new and exciting ways. What it really means is a community center. The idea is hardly new, but in years of dreaming, nobody has put together something like this before. There are a couple very successful science fiction clubhouses out there, and they helped inspire us to take the idea beyond the next level. Now, they think, the time is right.

We're a family artificial grass installation company that's focused on offering the highest quality products from the best artificial turf manufacturers.  Since joining the industry over 10 years ago, owner Jason Miller explains that the rapidly-changing artificial turf market has contributed to the widespread use of poor quality products, and worse, the emergence of companies who cut corners on their installs to drive up profits: “The products we offer, of which some are 100% recyclable, are satisfying specific install requirements, like helping designers and architects gain LEED certification points, helping homeowners address specific drainage requirements or enhance their properties. Whatever your unique needs, we'll help you find the right products for your project.” All Miller’s turf systems are installed with a proper drainage system and are backed by an ten-year warranty. “We’ve installed millions of square feet of artificial turf at homes, businesses, dog kennels, golf courses, children's day care facilities and more, so we know how to do the job right the first time,” Jason says. Customers can visit Miller’s Synthetic Turf at their Rocklin showroom to learn about the practical applications for turf and examine a variety of synthetic grass products being displayed.
