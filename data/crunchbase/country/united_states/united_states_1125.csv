(PTI) has been to create pharmaceutical therapies for treating dopamine-related central nervous system (CNS) diseases.    Depression has continued to challenge the medical community in recent decades. Although there are some known treatments for depression, the relapse rates are unacceptably high, and new treatment options are desperately needed.    What we are doing is crucial for 350 million patients, as depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide. The burden of depression and other mental health conditions is on the rise globally.    Our first quest is to develop a medication for Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD), a disease that affects approximately 4.8 million people in the US, and over 17 million throughout the world. A successful cure continues to elude our industry and these millions of patients, despite billions of dollars of investment by some of the brightest minds and development teams in our industry.    Based on research and clinical results to date, we believe that we have found the key that unlocks the door to a successful therapy for TRD, as well as a promising platform for other diseases such as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Depression in Parkinson’s, and Impulsive Compulsive Disorders (ICD).   With our patented pharmacologic innovation and further clinical development, we intend to restore a happy and productive life to millions of people afflicted with TRD, MDD, ICD and other CNS diseases. PTI is currently raising up to $15M to conduct the Phase 2b study in TRD as well as clinical work and a Phase 2a study in BED.
