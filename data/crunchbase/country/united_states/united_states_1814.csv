And, while we recently moved our operation to the US East Coast, our roots are still very much grounded in our paradise-home; the Caribbean. In the 90’s we were the official clothing brand of the professional beach volleyball circuit, the AVP, and sponsored some of the best beach players in the world. These days, with a full product line of high performance gear, both indoor and beach, VB Rags is the fastest growing volleyball brand in the market. In the past few years, we have been operating Team VB RAGS, a junior volleyball club whose primary objective is to provide high potential junior players with multi-dimensional training so they can leverage it in pursuit of college scholarships-which will change their lives forever. Most of the players who have graduated from our program have gone on to play college volleyball with a full scholarship. And, as if we didn’t already have our hands full, in 2014 we are launching the VB Rags Volleyball Academy with Mike Dodd, a unique concept in the development of youth beach volleyball players. In short, we live and breath volleyball. It is our aim to capture the imagination of the volleyball community worldwide, innovating to create functional, revolutionary new products that Unleash the Power Within for all volleyball players. Our appetite for functional breakthroughs often finds us all alone in the volleyball community, walking in paths others wouldn’t dare take. That’s ok with us.

Whether you are an indie or major artist, all music is still about business, optimizing capital. For that reason, every artist should also be in the business of learning, building, and monetizing their artist brand. Our solid approach to achieving this is to build a conduit to professional peers within our niche  –  the indie music community. Why? Because every unique variety of artist contributes a specific skill set that will ensure the survival of the entire community. As with major artists, it requires a cohesive professional community to build a brand. Established, popular artists you see today, exist in large part because of such unstoppable community strength and vitality.
