The site was inspired by the corkboards outside of local supermarkets, libraries, college campuses, and other public places where people post messages of all sorts. The idea at Corkin.com is to do the same. Whether youâ€™re looking for a roommate, trying to sell you bike, announce a party youâ€™re hosting, looking for a job, or just simply want to leave a message to someone you know, all you have to do is announce it on the site. It basically allows users to post classifieds and interact with sellers providing a much safer online buying and selling experience than currently available on the net. The site has several categories which users can browse through, including Community, For Sale, Personals, Jobs, Services, Housing, and Gigs. In order to post you will first need to sign up. The site also offers a forum where users can come together and discuss all sorts of things.",Commerce and Shopping,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
