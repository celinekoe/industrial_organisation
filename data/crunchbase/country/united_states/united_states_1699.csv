The company was originally located in Woburn, Massachusetts and was a pioneer in the development of short-range, high data rate, wireless communication links for densely populated areas, such as Tokyo, where connection to fiber was not readily available or too expensive to be considered. The solution was a 100 Mbps, 60 GHz radio link that could easily be deployed on rooftops, behind windows, etc. Financial backing came from Omron Corporation and SoftBank, both Japanese companies, and the capability to develop and manufacture the radio link was built up around the founders. Engineers, technicians and assemblers came from companies such as Lockheed Sanders (now BAE Systems), Textron, Alpha Industries, M/A-COM and Millitech to form the core millimeter wave group that is still in place today. Radio link deployments were originally in Japan and expanded to the U.S. when regulations were established. In October 2000, Harmonix became the first company to obtain certification for a radio product under the FCC regulations for the newly established 57 - 64 GHz band. A complementary Components and Sub-systems business, servicing government contractors, subcontractors, government entities and educational institutions, was a natural extension of the radio business, as the technology already existed within the company. The HXI brand name was established around this time and was used for both businesses.","Hardware, Manufacturing, Mobile",,,11-50,1,M&A,3500000,USD,3500000,3500000,USD,3500000,SoftBank Capital,1,1,,Private,,,,,,

In 1914, Charles G. Gunther began prospecting in the Skouriotissa area after reading in ancient books that the island was rich in copper and noticing promising ancient Roman slag heaps in the area. The company was established in 1916 by Colonel Seeley W. Mudd and his son, Harvey Seeley Mudd. Initially the mine struggled, but eventually obstacles were overcome and the mine produced money. Turkish and Greek Cypriots were hired, and the town of Skouriotissa became a hub because so many miners moved there. The corporation took an old-style, paternalistic attitude towards workers, building a company town around the mine. Harvey Seeley Mudd claimed his experience with the Cyprus Mines Corporation influenced him to push the study of humanities in the engineering college he started, Harvey Mudd College. The Cyprus Mines Corporation provided copper to Nazi Germany right up until the start of the World War II. Although it is clear they knew they were giving aid to the Nazi military, the owner of the mine claims he didn't want to put the Cypriots out of jobs by cutting sales to Germany. They were, however, disturbed by Hitler's policy of Jewish persecution, and in late 1938, CMC established a relief fund along with their agent to help former business associates get out of Germany",Natural Resources,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
