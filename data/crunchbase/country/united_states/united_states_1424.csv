And since he started putting his vision into action, scores of companies (with an estimated 10,000 workers) have followed his lead and moved their offices to Detroit.  Dozens of companies, many of them in creative industries such as advertising, architecture and design, are flocking to central-city Detroit in a surprising reversal of the mass exodus to the suburbs that took place during the past half century. (for more detail see http://www.businessinsider.com/after-filing-bankruptcy-detroit-is-on-the-verge-of-an-epic-comeback-2013-7?op=1)   Detroit is rebounding from its “depression” of a decade ago. However, real estate values in many areas of the city have yet to respond. There are a substantial number of homes, owned by banks, whose values have yet to respond to the improving economy in Detroit. (In 2010 the average price of a home was $7,500.)  New Detroit will acquire homes located in neighbourhoods which are experiencing a “rebirth”. The homes must have been rehabilitated within the last 3 months and leased to Section 8 tenants or other acceptable tenants. The purchase price for the homes must be such that the net cash flow, after property taxes, management fees, insurance and a repair allowance, will yield cash returns of at least 10% per annum.   The supply of vacant homes available at discount prices is substantial. In 2015 Wayne County estimates that 30,000 homes will be sold for delinquent taxes. There are a number of companies which purchase foreclosed homes or homes sold for delinquent taxes. These companies rehabilitate the homes, secure acceptable tenants and sell the leased homes.",Real Estate,3,"George Wilcken Romney, Jerome Patrick Cavanagh, Joseph L.

High-accuracy in-store shopper path and behavior insights with no store infrastructure. What if there was a new, innovative approach to track in-store shopper behavior that delivers consistent in-aisle shopper position accuracy to 1.5 meters and addresses the scalability challenge by eliminating the need for any in-store systems or technology? Solving both of these challenges (accuracy and scalability) is possible today using motion sensing technology that is already available in most shopper smartphones. Accuracy and scalability are the driving factors behind the creation of Coursa Retail Coursa Retail helps retailers, brands and digital ad platforms to accurately measure or execute the following: Improved offline attribution: When a shopper views a digital mobile ad on their smartphone, does it lead to the shopper visiting the shelf in-store where that product is located.	In-store missed conversions: Measure all product categories that a shopper visits in-store. Highlight which category visits do not lead to a purchase (missed conversions). Enables retailers and brands to retarget these shoppers with incentives to purchase these products on their next visit to the store.	Personalization: Build detailed profiles of in-store shopper behavior based on the ability to record a shopper’s entire walking path and dwell points across all store visits. Coursa’s mobile SDK and SaaS platform uses smartphone motion sensors to capture every step, turn, dwell point, and product engagement shoppers make inside physical stores with meter-level accuracy. In-aisle, Coursa determines which shelf and bay the shopper is facing, which product category they look at, and how long they remain engaged.
