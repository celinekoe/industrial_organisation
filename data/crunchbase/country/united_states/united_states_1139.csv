MyWerx mission is to make it easy for anyone to know who owns and / or licensesâ€™ a work. The foundation of our platform is a validated-wiki, copyright registry. Posting and validating a work is a free service to help creators and their representatives organize a portfolio of the lifeâ€™s work of an author. Premium subscriptions provide access to services that will benefit all stakeholders in a work. Our Beta release allows creators with an interest in a work to add a work to the registry. The registry will automate email communication to all creators associated with a work. The communications contain a hyperlink to access MyWerx on the web. An easy to use interface for validating critical information like titles, author names and their ownership interests make reaching agreement on the creatorsâ€™ splits a simple step for everyone. No one can see or access any data unless they have a validated ownership interest. Each step in the validation process requires consensus of the parties. Subsequent releases will allow storing and communicating with business representatives of a work and track copyright ownership transfers throughout the life cycle of a registered work. Correct ownership and representative information is increasing in necessity because of the growing number of internet users creating and exposing their copyrighted works. Copyright viability and value is at risk when the market interested in using them must invest hours of time tracking down the owners or licensing agents to obtain permission. MyWerx will continuously research and develop forward thinking copyright focused services that bring value to the global copyright community.","Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Internet Services, Software",1,Tim Smith,11-50,1,Seed,14000,USD,14000,14000,USD,14000,XMi High Growth Development Fund,,1,,Private,,,,,,
