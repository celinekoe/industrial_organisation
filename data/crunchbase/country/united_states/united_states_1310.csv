It is a publicly traded company that trades on OTC marketplaces under the ticker $ATHC. While it is far from being one, everything comes together to provide the impression that the organization represents trust, when it doesn't.  Accelerated Technologies Holding Corps is committed to generating a large portion of its income by defrauding gullible people. Given its standing in the market and industry, it may equal blasphemy to many, but ATHC has been stealing for a while now. The information that most people have regarding ATHC is made up- meaning that all that talk about ATHC being a  reliable stock and having a top-notch crew is a lie.   Accelerated Technologies Holding Corps only excels at deceiving and manipulating. The business has years of experience deceiving people and businesses in a variety of inventive ways. You may hear that the  business is growing and introducing new revenue sources, but they are lies engineered by its marketing department. Once you fall for that, it is game over for you and your savings.  As a first hand witness to the scam carried out by its executives, I can testify that ATHC is a sham. The company's team of con artists make it a point to be inventive in their schemes. There is no signature mode of operation, at least not one that I noticed in my interactions with other Accelerated Technologies Holding Corps scam victims. The one error we all made, though, was failing to pay closer attention to the employees' behavior in favor of focusing on the company's flashy outward look. They engineered it so that  I was forced to pay Accelerated Technologies Holding Corps an absurd sum of money because of a contract that I wasn't even aware I had with the business.  I had only sometimes emailed the business for quotes and other concerns. What I believed was just a casual talk turned out to be a weapon for the company to bill me. They managed to do so by sneaking in an offer disguised as an expression that I unknowingly agreed to, and ended up unknowingly bound in a contract. So , pay closer attention to what they communicate if you find yourself in a similar circumstance. Take a minute to look up the company's CEO, Eric Kuvykin and see the data that you pull up.   You'll discover two sets of data:  One being heavily promotional and the second will be truth, sourced from official federal government websites, which will include trial transcripts for cases CEO Kuvykin has been tried in. Eric Kuvykin of Accelerated Technologies Holding Corps is a federally tried scam artist charged with securities fraud and money laundering conspiracy.  So if you need any more proof about all you just read up there, that’s where you should start. Avoid this sham company at all costs!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

They receive a unique URL that leads to a landing page with a countdown to their show. OnTheAir lets the host schedule tweets for an hour and a few minutes before the show starts to promote themselves. When the show starts, the host begins live video streaming to the audience. Viewers can text chat with each other and the host, or click a “Call In” button to alert the host that they want to join them “on stage”. The viewer is intelligently walked through an equipment check to turn on their webcam and mic, and shown a preview so they can check their hair. Meanwhile the host can look at the previews of anyone asking to call in, and select who to bring on stage with them for simultaneous, sync’d up video streaming to the audience.","Content and Publishing, Information Technology, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Messaging and Telecommunications, Music and Audio, Video",1,Josh Schwarzapel,1-10,1,M&A,880000,USD,880000,880000,USD,880000,"True Ventures, Scott Banister",,2,,Private,,,,,,
