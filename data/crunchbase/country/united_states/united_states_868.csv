About Pierre Subehm, founder and CEO of X Network: Pierre Subeh is an author, business expert, and award-winning executive producer. He is mostly known for advocating Middle-Eastern representation and pushing the U.S. Department of State & The White House under the Biden-Harris administration to recognize April as the national Arab American Heritage Month. He has been featured for his business expertise on Forbes, The Washington Post, Yahoo News, CNBC, and The New York Post. Early on in his career, he focused on studying the psychology of human behavior and the science behind efficient productivity. He is a natural leader when it comes to managing teams and creating successful ventures. Pierre was awarded as a young entrepreneur when he owned a 6-figure profitable business at age 17. Subeh was born on 25 October 1998 in Lattakia, Syria. He moved with his family to the Caribbean island of Curaçao in 2010 and settled between the Caribbean and Florida. Following graduation from the Florida Virtual School in the Curaçao American Preparatory School Institute, he attended Harvard Business School under a fully paid scholarship opportunity to their CORe program. Subeh is a columnist on business and marketing for Forbes and several other major publications. He makes frequent TV appearances across North America and the Middle East for his business expertise. In 2021, he was invited as a judge of honor to the American Business Awards where he judged over 221 submissions and helped determine the winners of ""Best in Business"". Pierre Subeh makes a significant part of the modern history of Arab Americans with his accomplishments. His campaign convinced the U.S. Department of State, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and The White House under the Biden-Harris administration to recognize the month of April as the National Arab American Heritage Month. In 2021, he openly criticized The Academy Awards for not having enough Arab-American representation, which picked up the media attention of the largest magazines and publications in the world to interview him. His infamous quote, ""We're only mentioned when Aladdin is brought up. I don't feel motivated to gather up my family on a Sunday to sit through a four-hour award ceremony that never has any sort of mention about our culture and religion. Yet as Muslims, we make up roughly 25% of the world population"", which would later be featured in the Associated Press, Washington Post, The New York Post, ABC, CNBC, and Yahoo Movies.","Advertising, Internet Services, Sales and Marketing, Software",1,Pierre Subeh,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
