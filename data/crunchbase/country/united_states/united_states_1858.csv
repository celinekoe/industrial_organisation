In April of 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups – or JOBS Act – lifted an 80-year ban on general solicitation for certain private securities offerings. In a sweeping effort to stimulate the startup economy, the JOBS Act made public solicitation of private investment by entrepreneurs to institutions and accredited investors much easier. At Venovate, we seized this opportunity and built the world’s largest alternative investment marketplace for accredited individuals and institutional investors. A marriage of venture and innovation, Venovate is creating an online market that gives these investors access to exciting new investment opportunities. Venovate makes the investing process safer and easier by requiring members to present comprehensive and consistent information, in a standardized format. New members – both buyers and sellers – are put through a rigorous screening process, to ensure that investors are qualified and companies present complete, transparent information. Investors can search for investment opportunities, get questions answered, indicate interest, receive acceptance, sign documents electronically, and close the transaction – all in the Venovate Marketplace. Both buyer and seller benefit from the easy-to-use online system – enabled for the web, tablet, and smartphone – designed to make capital formation easier.
