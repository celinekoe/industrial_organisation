Our Sexual Assault/Domestic Violence app allows victims greater control over encounters with authorities. Our Anti-Bullying app allows victims to control an encounter with their bully. ISCE.edu was founded in 1999 as an educational research institution seeking to understand how complex change occurs in groups of all sizes. Our research suggested that while direct attempts to cause change usually go astray, indirect attempts (via tweaking contexts in which behavior occurs) more often succeed. In 2015, we developed and implemented a plan to apply our theoretical insights to critical real world issues, with the goal of improving safety throughout society. The key insight came in realizing that, with proper design and distribution, technology – now in our pockets – can empower victims who otherwise feel powerless.   Our innovative technology includes a suite of smartphone apps that radically ""change the context"" through which victims see themselves and their lives. Our smartphone apps for Anti-Bullying, Sexual Assault, and Domestic Violence begin national roll-out in Fall 2016. As part of this roll-out, we welcome all inquiries regarding joint programs or prospective partnerships. With Sexual Assault, increasing potential victim awareness is our goal. The app helps empower victims first through their awareness that the app stays close at hand if ever needed. Other apps focus on getting victims or bystanders to report an attack. Our IBV app is focused on helping the 85% who are not ready to report by giving victims a tool both to make a contemporaneous record and to maintain control over their story. To deal effectively with Bullying, we aim to address the underlying issue known as the Bullying Cycle. Victims of bullying often end up as bullies themselves (or worse, domestic abusers later) and have damaged psyches due to continued feelings of powerlessness and humiliation. While other programs serve noble purposes (e.g., bystander intervention, school reporting, and improved school climate) they fail to address the wounded psyche of the bullied victim. Our The-No-App empowers those victims by giving them a tool to control an encounter with the bully. Empowerment is the first step to break the bullying cycle. Our apps are free and are for iOS and Android.","Education, Health Care, Professional Services",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
