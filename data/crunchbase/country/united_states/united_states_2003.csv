Our products are used by system integrator partners and by system manufacturers who benefit from the unique characteristics of our sensors — namely small size, low cost, unattended operation, and the ability to detect a broad range of threats with a single, standard sensor configuration. The company was founded in 2004 to commercialize a unique sensor technology developed at the University of Nevada, Reno. Early R&D was supported by DARPA, the DOD, and the Department of Homeland Security. NevadaNano has now turned its focus to commercial applications, specifically, the Internet of Things (IOT). NevadaNano is uniquely positioned to address a broad range of sensor applications. Vapors from bio-agents have been successfully detected, as have chemicals representative of illicit drugs and human respiration. The greatest impact from chemical, explosive, and bio-sensors will only be felt when they can be deployed ubiquitously in large numbers and over wide areas. This will only happen when sensors are small and affordable, can sense a very broad range of substances, and are robust enough to operate unattended for long periods of time. The core element of NevadaNano’s sensor modules and systems is manufactured on a solid-state, MEMS technology, offering small size, low cost, and high reliability. The sensing element is an array of MEMS structures that are not only self-activating and self-sensing, they are also self-cleaning and self-calibrating, thus enabling unattended deployment for extended periods. Using proprietary materials as well as unique sensing methods and analysis techniques, a single sensor configuration is able to detect hundreds of diverse types of vapors and particles. These advantages make our Molecular Property Spectrometer™ (MPS™) solution the leading candidate to fulfill the vision of ubiquitous sensor deployment for both homeland security and commercial applications.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Manufacturing, Science and Engineering",2,"Jesse Adams, Ralph Whitten",11-50,8,,39513661,USD,39513661,45013661,USD,45013661,"Advantage Capital, JCI Ventures, Ray Stata",1,3,,Private,,,,,,

Since the dawn of agriculture, human beings have continually sought higher efficiency and security in the production and trading of food. The modern age has seen the economics of agriculture and soft commodities repeatedly transformed by sudden technical innovations, a pattern which will continue to repeat itself. In the 1850’s advancements in refrigeration and food preservation dramatically lowered food prices and increased availability. In the 1940’s innovation came in the form of gasoline tractors replacing horse drawn plows. Today, blockchain technology is poised to play a major part in the agricultural revolution of our time.  GrainChain’s patent pending solution utilizes blockchain technology to address numerous issues present within the soft commodities markets, such as fraud at all stages, large and small-scale corruption, payment delays, access to futures commodities market, and a cycle of debt that is difficult to escape.  GrainChain changes this.  GrainChain utilizes the well-known properties of blockchains to address the systemic problems present in soft commodities markets, an industry in which the GrainChain team already has first hand experience in building software solutions.  The GrainChain system greatly increases transparency and accountability within the agriculture business by eliminating disparate and wasteful paper trails, greatly eliminating the opportunity for fraud and dramatically reducing time and costs. It ensures the prompt and secure execution of contracts between farmers and buyers, by both automatically facilitating payment to the farmer and making available the corresponding financial instrument for trading on commodities markets while verifying it is backed by only real assets in the system. This shortens a process that can currently take weeks down to a nearly instantaneous one. GrainChain benefits farmers, buyers, brokers, storage facilities, banks, suppliers of agricultural goods, governments, and ultimately every food consumer on earth; everyone that benefits from a more honest and efficient agricultural indust GrainChain was first introduced in 2013 by an inventor and entrepreneur Luis Macias.","Agriculture and Farming, Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Other",4,"Carlos Huggins, Fernando Campos, Jaime Lopez, Luis Macias",11-50,3,,39700000,USD,39700000,39700000,USD,39700000,"Overstock, Pelion Venture Partners, Eden Block, Medici Ventures, BYU Cougar Capital",1,5,,Private,,,,,,
