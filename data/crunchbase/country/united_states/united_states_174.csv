EMT has also long served as a premier provider of education and training support for medical schools, hospital systems, and healthcare associations, such as the Florida Dental Association. That team is composed entirely of uniquely qualified physician educators, all of whom are specially selected on the basis of extensive academic accomplishments, teaching experience, and excellence in their clinical specialties. Each member of EMT’s faculty is an accomplished medical practitioner in their own right. Many operate their own dermatology or plastic surgery practices, specializing in procedures such as Botox and other neurotoxins, lasers, and thread lifts, among others.  The EMT team also has an accomplished roster of non-physician specialists leading non-clinical education workshops in vital functions such as medical coding, anatomy, laser operation, marketing, digital media, and more. Dr. Cosentino and his team are always seeking the next great additions to the EMT team; anyone willing and able to contribute specialized knowledge and verifiable expertise is welcome.  Under Dr. Cosentino’s guidance, Empire Medical Training is committed to developing new training programs that advance the cutting edge of primary care practice. As a result, the organization’s curriculum continues to expand, adding coursework around well-established procedures, proprietary techniques, and emerging areas of study alike. In all, EMT’s clinical and non-clinical educators oversee more than 700 live workshops featuring hands-on training, countless more virtual training programs that EMT broadcasts live to viewers across North America and beyond, and multiple specialized preceptorships for intimate, in-depth training.   EMT’s physicians and staff educators are also proud to support the organization’s mission to do good in the world. Led by Dr. Cosentino, the team provides consulting services and mentorship to aesthetic practice leaders and other medical practitioners across North and South America, and performs charity work in Peru.

EVDrive observed two main problems with commercial fleets:   Commercial  fleet vehicles, like city transit buses with ever increasing heavy electrical loads, use out-dated battery technology & no controls to manage power usage and delivery.  Secondly, hybrid vehicle technology was not available at a price that could trigger mass adoption by Commercial fleets that use the most fuel & could gain the most from the technology.  Yes, brand new hybrid commercial vehicles are available today, but are dramatically over-priced for the reduced operation costs they deliver.  In addition, EVDrive realized that vehicle turnover in fleets is measured in decades & that to make a real near-term impact, hybrid technology would have to be applicable (retrofits/conversions) to in service vehicles already on the road as well as new vehicles entering the fleet. The ability to make existing vehicles more efficient & to accelerate the adoption of new technology in less time than the typical 5 year (or longer) automotive product development cycle is a game-changer. Battery, motor, power electronics, & control technology have been rapidly improving, creating an opportunity for a small technology company to design solutions to these 2 related problems.  In addition, mass-produced lower cost electric motor technology from related small vehicle fields has unique opportunities when applied properly to hybrid retrofit powertrain solutions.   PRIMARY MARKET: Company designs & develops Electric drivetrain upgrades that increase MPG for commercial fleet vehicles that have short ROI and low operational risk to vehicle owners.  See slides @ http://gust.com/c/evdrive that summarize the Commercial Fleet Systems product line.   Secondary markets are:  1 - ""near-oem-quality"" complete battery-only liquid-cooled electric drivetrains for Commercial Fleet trucks & high performance speciality vehicles 2 - electric & hybrid electric powertrain conversion kits for powersports vehicles such as off-road & street motorcycles & UTVs Company's technology is developed & offered in 3 levels: Superior high performance components, sub-systems and complete drivetrains for a wide range of vehicles and applications.","Manufacturing, Transportation",2,"Robert Simpson, steve e tice",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
