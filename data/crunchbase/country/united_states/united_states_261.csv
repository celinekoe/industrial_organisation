Now national in scope, MIM works through constitutional means to curb traffic in obscenity and uphold standards of decency in media. Common sense, anecdotal evidence and social science research all point to a link between obscenity and indecency and harmful consequences. In 1968, one of the clergy, Fr. Morton A. Hill, was appointed by President Johnson to serve on the Presidential Commission on Obscenity and Pornography. In 1970, the Commission issued a report recommending that obscenity be legalized for consenting adults. Fr. Hill and another Commissioner issued a minority report describing the majority report as a “Magna Carta for the pornographer” and, in so doing, helped save obscenity laws. President Nixon and Congress also rejected the majority report, and the Supreme Court later cited the Hill-Link minority report in upholding obscenity laws.","Other, Social Impact",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The company also offers training apparel and outerwear for men, women and children.  The company currently sells its products wholesale to Team Sporting Good Dealers who market and sell to youth leagues, travel teams, high schools, colleges and semi- professional teams.  Team Sporting Good Dealers market and sell online, in their stores and through travelling sales reps.  The company has sales throughout the United States and Europe.  The company owns and manages its own factory in Tijuana, Mexico.  Company owned, cross-border manufacturing provides a unique competitive advantage. Maxim Athletic is able to provide faster, more reliable delivery than its competitors.  In a survey of 2,400 high school coaches, eighty five percent (85%) complained of poor service, directly related to late deliveries and long delivery times.   Each coach responded by saying they would be very open to a new supplier who could provide more reliable delivery and service. Management believes there’s a $100,000,000 opportunity for the company in Team Sporting Goods. While the company is currently focused on the Team Sporting Goods niche market, it plans to leverage its position in team sporting goods to launch a retail division.  Management believes there is a billion dollar opportunity in consumer retail sales.  Maxim Athletic competitors spend billions of dollars acquiring professional leagues, high profile athletes and entertainers to create an elite image.
