Everyone knows the concept of living life to the fullest but the problem is that it is simply human nature to take things for granted, which is why most people complain continuously about Mondays, traffic, and weather. People have argued that they can live life to the fullest every day but not only is that impossible, it is unhealthy. What do they do when they experience a tragic loss or disaster? The idea of living life to the fullest persuade us not to be bothered or influenced negatively by any situation, so we force ourselves into feeling happy, which often leads to abusing drugs and alcohol. Instead, we believe that we should embrace the pain to be able to appreciate the pleasure. Most of us don't need to be convinced to think more positively, we just simply need a reminder.  For example, how do you feel when a friend or relative passes away?  We all get a sense of gratitude for our lives and often decide to live life a little bit better, only because we appreciate our lives more. But this feeling is temporary so we all find ourselves complaining about situations again...until the next reminder, such as having a friend get into an accident, or seeing someone else less fortunate than you. Our goal is for our brand just to act as that reminder.  We're hoping that every time you wear our apparel and see our brand, you will be reminded to stop complaining about your life, to take life a little less for granted and to take more risks when it's worth it.","Clothing and Apparel, Community and Lifestyle, Design, Health Care",1,"Ricardo Zulueta, Jr.",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The company is based in Florida, and it services mostly customers from the immediate Fort Myers area, although customers from adjacent communities are welcome as well. Over the years, the company has established a reputation of quality and professionalism, both of which are apparent in every project undertaken. Action offers one of the most comprehensive ranges of heating and air-conditioning system-related services in the region. Although the firm’s clientele is comprised mainly of residential customers, its in-house team of specialists possesses the skills, knowledge, and capability to deal with most any heating and air-conditioning-related concern in any setting. In fact, some of Action team’s longest-running contracts are associated with corporate and industrial clients. Among the quality services provided by the Action team are: •	Heating and air-conditioning system design  •	Heating and air-conditioning system installation •	Custom design and retrofitting  •	System repair and maintenance  •	System inspection and diagnosis •	Repair estimation  •	After-market and follow-up services •	Residential and workplace air care and treatment    This is only a partial listing of the services provided by Action. The company’s team of air-conditioning and heating professionals is also routinely called upon to oversee the design and installation of custom systems, a task which it is more than capable of handling. The Action team in fact specializes in delivering a range of state-of-the-art heating and/or air-conditioning systems ideally suited to meet the most stringent demands. No job is too difficult for the Action team to handle, and each job–whether big or small, corporate or residential–is approached with the same level of competence and professionalism that has made Action Cooling a household name in southwest Florida.  Another of Action’s notable areas of specialization is system analysis and problem solving in a residential scenario. The company is operated on a policy of delivering full customer satisfaction at all times, and it is especially capable of providing innovative solutions that address the specific needs of its customers. The Action team is fully aware that everyone’s needs with regard to heating and air-conditioning are different, which is why every project is considered thoroughly with the goal of providing customers with the ideal solution befitting their needs and circumstances. Action Cooling even carries a selection of high-quality parts and components, ensuring the delivery of a full range of services.  They pride themselves on their ability to keep Floridan's cool in the summer, warm in the winter, and breathing and living in the freshest air possible. To do so, they provide comprehensive maintenance packages, including regular maintenance, and custom-built plans for customers.  When you put your trust in Action, you don't need to worry about home air again. They will make sure you are comfortable and healthy.  Also, what they love doing is educating and teaching the customers who are interested. While they typically give a 30,000 foot view of the project, the technicians love speaking technical talk if needed.  The best strategy, they find, is to listen and be as receptive as possible. Never expect anyone to know anything about HVAC - but if they do, make sure the customer gets the most correct and helpful information. Because at the end of the day, what matters is the happiness of the customer and their satisfaction. Go with Action services, and they will ensure you are fully satisfied. Action Cooling also LOVES connecting with customers. They make a prominent effort each year to attend home remodeling and home and garden shows in the local Fort Myers area. In fact, in 2015, Action is attending three different shows: Harborside Event Center's Home and Remodeling Show September 25-27, 2015, Charlotte Harbor's Home and Garden Show October 10-11, 2015, and Germaine Area's Home Improvement Show November 7-8, 2015.  They set up games, give customers a chance to win free services, and spend quality time with the event goers. Mark Vose always is sure to attend; as General Manager and the backbone of the company, he is able to speak with prospects about the company and services they provide. And not just that, he listens closely and attempts to provide solutions to the individuals interested. If they show direct interest at the shows and events, he always is sure to take care of them. On top of this, they regularly do demonstrations and presentations around the local area. At the Cape Coral Lowes on October 18-19, 2015, they will be giving consumers money saving tips and showcasing their HVAC knoweldge. This is a little more difficult to connect with customers, says Mark, but still is effective in its own right.","Consumer Electronics, Consumer Goods, Hardware, Real Estate",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

They live in a society increasingly aware of the global and US based terror and violence. Every day, they watch the news and see law enforcement show up after a crime is committed. Private citizens are becoming armed and trained to protect their families and loved ones. People are buying guns and holsters for protection. The company's mission statement is displayed in the logo: """"Protecting Families . . . Saving Lives.""""    CCW Breakaways is a patented, disruptive innovation. The products are viewed by their customers as a firearm accessory first, and secondarily as a specialty garment. This new product permits an entirely new process to be employed. They replace traditional holstering methods. Their sales generally precede or succeed the purchase of a firearm in an industry showing consistent growth in today's terrorism-violence conscious world.    CCW Breakaways' revenue from 2010 (launch) through 2014 was $424,023 (growing by 2.5X annually). A 1% gun holster market share is valued at $19M annually.    2014 and 2015 Sales dipped due to two failures in the manufacturing supply chain, which resulted in out-of-stock SKUs during a rampant customer demand. The first US manufacturer shut down in 2012 after 50+ years in the industry. The second off-shore manufacturing relationship was terminated in 2013 after failure to deliver on orders. The third US manufacturer is currently producing product, but at insufficient volumes. The fourth and fifth off-shore manufacturers are being qualified now and are expected to begin production in early 2016. The product quality will be even better than the current high quality as a result of the improved companies' core competencies and the consistency of their skilled workforces. Their volume will be sustainable and expandable with their growth. The costs and margins will also improve substantially.","Clothing and Apparel, Design, Manufacturing",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
