Albert, Inc. was started by Robert Lawrence Albert in 1916 as a gourmet food and European specialty product importer.  As the company grew, it expanded its reach into confectionery. In the 1930’s, Robert’s son, Sidney joined the business, and imports of confectionery from Europe continued to grow. The company was renamed R.L. Albert & Son, Inc. However, World War II intervened, and the only way to survive was to reach out to South America. Albert’s was the first US importer to buy candy from Argentina in the form of a mint roll from a company called Trineo. South American imports kept the company afloat during the war, and after the war ended, European confectionery imports resumed and expanded with brands from Austria, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, England, and elsewhere. With the passing of its founder Robert in the late 1950s, Sidney Albert assumed the Presidency and asked long time former New York wholesaler Abe Appelbaum to assist him in running the company. Sidney, along with his wife Insulinda continued to explore new opportunities throughout Europe and beyond. Shortly thereafter, Sidney’s son, Lawrence Albert (Larry) joined the company and imports quickly expanded to areas such as Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Hong Kong and Japan. The gourmet part of the company was de-emphasized and children’s confections and novelties were added. The theme of “There is always something new in the Albert line” was born and in the late 1970’s, Alberts moved its headquarters to Greenwich, Ct.  In 1971, Robert Katz joined the company as Sales Manager and eventual successor to General Manager, Abe.",Food and Beverage,,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
