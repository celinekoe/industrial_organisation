This technology facilitates enhanced procedure outcomes by adapting individualized treatment plans including precise laser delivery and efficient lens fragmentation that can reduce, and potentially eliminate, the amount of ultrasonic energy delivered into the eye.  Additionally, the IntelliAxis Refractive Capsulorhexis® feature provides another dimension of accuracy with biomechanically stable, steep axis markings that help guide precise toric IOL alignment. The marks remain visible postoperatively to help identify any rotation and guide the realignment of the toric IOL to its optimal position. IntelliAxis Refractive Capsulorhexis also incorporates the wireless transfer of preoperative diagnostics from the Cassini® Corneal Shape Analyzer and Pentacam® to help eliminate transcription errors, save time, and guide more confident astigmatism correction.  Iris registration further contributes to the system’s accuracy by comparing a pre-op image taken while the eye is docked and adaptively compensates for cyclo rotation for confidence incision placement. LENSAR has recently expanded the platform’s capabilities to include the creation of micro radial incisions that allow surgeons to treat additional corneal conditions post-cataract surgery and support presbyopia inlay procedures.   Building on the strength of LENSAR’s foundational femtosecond cataract laser platform, the LENSAR Laser with Streamline IV simplifies practice and surgical workflows while also revolutionizing a surgeon’s ability to deliver optimal outcomes for astigmatic patients.",Health Care,2,"Randy Frey, Ronald Krueger",101-250,13,M&A,99096818,USD,99096818,177521818,USD,177521818,"Aisling Capital, Oxford Finance LLC, Florida Opportunity Fund, PDL Biopharma, Florida Growth Fund",2,5,1,Public,2020-10-01,,,LNSR,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/lensar-ipo--20c6c204,NASDAQ

Centene began as a single health plan in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1984. After an initial period of growth, Michael Neidorff joined as President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in 1996, moving Centene’s headquarters to St. Louis, Missouri, where it still resides today. In the decades since its humble beginnings, Centene has transformed into a publicly-traded Fortune 500 company serving communities across the United States. In fact, Centene provides coverage in all 50 U.S. states. More than 26 million Americans rely on Centene to access a wide range of insurance solutions, including Medicaid, Medicare, TRICARE, correctional, and behavioral health services.

As a steward of a significant set of data and insights, Centene leverages this data to not only shape but lead the digital transformation of healthcare and improve the patient-provider experience. Centene’s current CEO,  Sarah London, and her team are leading the charge in this new age. Sarah London worked within Centene’s Technology Innovation and Modernization division, spearheading the company’s enterprise-wide technology strategy. Now leading Centene, her focus is on building the next generation of products and services and establishing Centene’s long-term growth and value creation.  Although Centene has grown into the No. 1 insurer in the U.S. Health Insurance Marketplace, it has never lost its focus on the individual or its passion for community health.

BeneFix offers health insurance brokers a digital platform that delivers 100% accurate quotes 100 times faster. Based in Lancaster, Pa., BeneFix manages data from thousands of plans  offered by major carriers in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, offering quotes in minutes from a simple-to-use online interface reminiscent of Zillow. Less than two years after founder Matt Ranauro first had the idea for the platform, the business had a brick-and-mortar office in Lancaster City, over 1,000 customers, and, most recently, became one of nine central Pennsylvania finalists competing for a $100,000 investment from AOL co-founder Steve Case’s “Rise of the Rest” initiative.  The success is due, Ranauro believes, to three factors.  First, his own passion for the product. Ranauro has co-founded several tech companies, most notably ILL Co., a company that has built apps for HBO and Nickelodeon, analytics platforms for KPMG and products for the Mayo Clinic. With each company, Ranauro needed to find health insurance for himself and his co-founders and employees. “It took about two months just to find out what was available, then get enrolled in those products.” He said. “Which seems crazy, right? In 2017?” The question became: how do we streamline this and make it a better experience for everyone? Ranauro’s previous experience is the second factor that contributes to the success and growth of BeneFix.  The final is the Insurtech industry itself.  With insurance, and health insurance particularly, still lagging behind other industries in terms of using and creating technologies that work, the Insurtech industry, a $4.5 trillion industry, has attracted the attention of venture capitalists and tech entrepreneurs alike. Lancaster (Ranauro’s hometown)  may be Amish country, full of farms, buggies and country roads, but BeneFix is out to prove that it’s also fertile soil for creating a company that will revolutionize the health insurance industries’ outdated model.

Our dynamic team, boasting extensive experience in technology and education, is dedicated to addressing the interoperability challenges faced by global learning institutions across PK-12, Higher Education, and Workforce solutions. In light of the evolving educational landscape, intensified by the impact of COVID, the demand for secure data exchange, data pipeline management, and data cleansing has never been more critical. Education paradigms have shifted, necessitating not only access to cutting-edge integrated cloud technology but also to seasoned teams capable of addressing long-term challenges. Authentica stands ready to meet these challenges head-on, drawing upon our team's global experience in designing, building, and deploying technology for various education organizations. This marks the inception of our ambitious vision, the Education Intelligence Platform - Seed™. Focused on significant revenue growth through a strategic mix of indirect and direct go-to-market approaches, our primary commitment is to serve our B2B partners, including EdTech Software Providers, Strategic Alliances with Google and Microsoft, Resellers, and System Integrators. It is worth noting that Authentica is already operating profitably and is reinvesting for substantial growth. To propel our platform's growth, market penetration, and B2B expansion at an optimal pace, we are seeking partnerships with the right venture capital firms to raise $7 million.

CISOs face an impossible risk landscape today.  80% of cybersecurity breaches start because of employee error.  The problem is exacerbating with generative AI, as a single hacker can specifically target thousands of employees in the same amount of time that they used to specifically target tens of employees with social engineering.  CISOs lack tools to deal with employee risk and are held accountable when a breach inevitably happens. By leveraging AI at each step, Dune Security empowers organizations to quantify individual risk through analyzing user behavior, context, learning patterns, and third party data. This allows the automation of tailored cybersecurity measures to each individual, transforming vulnerabilities into strengths. Dune is the central engine of all employee risk data, which is a solution that is not just timely for organizations but necessary in navigating the present cybersecurity landscape. This gives the CISO the capability to understand who are the high risk employees, to what extent, and why - as well as automatically remediate and restrict access to keep their organization safe. Today, Dune Security uniquely replaces legacy and ineffective security awareness training by pinpointing the crucial 8% of employees responsible for 80% of the risk, ensuring all employees receive personalized, machine learning-driven training tailored to their risk profile. CISOs also have easy access to quantifiable data via robust reporting and API-out capability, enabling them to both report to compliance auditors, regulators, and insurance underwriters, as well as restrict access to high-risk employees through other security systems.","Information Technology, Privacy and Security",,,1-10,1,Seed,175000,USD,175000,175000,USD,175000,Antler,1,1,,Private,,,,,,
