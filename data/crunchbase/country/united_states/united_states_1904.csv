We believe the value of educational programs should be based on their real world tangible outcomes such as income growth over time, speed, and low cost methods to achieve such ends. As opposed to the old education model of accumulating degrees, film awards and certifications to look good, while not necessarily achieving your desired results. We’re focused on creating products that shorten the path to what people truly want - high paying careers and growing production companies. The sole purpose of our programs is to help our video production experts grow their income (bigger), in less time (faster), for the the least amount of time and money investment possible (cost effective). When we, MrPaulXavier.com, ask questions of what to do in our business, these considerations come first. Will it help our clients grow? Will it help increase the speed of their success? Will this make it less expensive for them to succeed? The truth we keep in mind is that people don’t want licenses, degrees, or certifications just to have them. They want them for the sake of an outcome, typically higher earning potential in their career, increased productivity, more fulfilling work, and meaningful relationships with their coworkers, team members, and customers.

At Momentary Ink, we offer two different types of tattoos - temporary and semi-permanent. Both offer their range of benefits and it's worth understanding the difference before you decide to make your purchase. Temporary tattoos come in both full color and black & white styles. These tattoos last from between 3-5 days of normal use. Think of them as the upgraded version of the temporary tattoos that you had when you were a kid. Semi-permanent tattoos are more realistic and apply to skin in a dark blue color. These tattoos last longer at up to 1-2 weeks of normal use. Ultimately, your design will end up on a transparent background once it's printed. Our designer allows you to edit the image size and add text and shapes, but not remove parts of a design. We know that it's not always easy to remove the background from your design but we can help! Just add details about anything you want removed in the design notes section before you add to cart and we'll take care of it! We do not accept tattoos on people's bodies as it's just too difficult to deliver a great product (plus we don't want to steal artists' hard work)!

It should be user-friendly and straightforward to use. - Relationships don't happen when you sit behind the computer. So big attention is on mobile experience of the user. - It is not for the sales department only. Other teams hold important relationships in the business and will also be using the tool.
