Originally founded in Pittsburgh, PA USA as an electrical contracting firm, the company began manufacturing in the mid 1950’s. The Starline brand was first introduced by the idea of creating a smartly-designed, stationary yet flexible overhead power supply system. This idea eventually morphed into Starline Track Busway; today’s industry-leading overhead electrical power distribution system. By continuing to promote the concepts of innovation and smart yet simple design strategy, the Starline brand has evolved to include four main product lines: Track Busway, Plug-In Raceway, Critical Power Monitor (CPM), and DC Solutions. For decades now the Starline suite of products has provided industrial, retail, laboratory and mission critical and data center facilities with the most flexible, reliable and customizable power distribution systems on the market today. Starline Track Busway is a revolutionary, overhead power distribution system that is available in various sizes from 40 to 1200 amps. The systems most unique feature includes a continuous access slot, meaning power can be tapped at any location. This flexibility makes it the ideal solution for environments that are looking to expand or have the ability to change layouts; or those who would simply like to have these options available for the future. Other main benefits of the Starline Track Busway product include reduced facility construction costs, faster installation and the ability to customize solutions to fit your needs. Starline Plug-in Units can also be disconnected and connected without de-energizing the busway and the product requires no routine maintenance. Starline Plug-In Raceway incorporates the concept of flexibility in a wall-mounted power distribution system. Instead of having fixed outlets along a wall that come with traditional wiring methods, Plug-In Raceway offers receptacles that can be snapped in anywhere along the installed backplane- supplying a connection to power wherever it’s needed. Starline Critical Power Monitor (CPM) combines revenue-grade metering accuracy with the flexibility to choose how information is communicated. In addition to the optional display, a variety of Ethernet and serial communications interfaces facilitate seamless integration with BMS and DCIM packages. Starline CPM may be configured for Track Busway applications, as well as standalone sub-metering. Starline DC Solutions was created to offer a powerful, direct current (DC) alternative for data centers. As large power consumers, data centers require power support systems with flexible modularity, higher efficiency, more cost effective reliability, and a smaller footprint while enjoying the security of global safety listings. Starline DC Solutions has developed the unique power support system technology that makes DC power for data centers a reality. From the recent addition of DC Solutions to the launch of the new Critical Power Monitor (CPM), there is a clear commitment to sustaining Starline’s position within this industry. The company’s focus on innovation continues to pave the way for safer and more reliable power distribution systems.","Energy, Manufacturing",,,11-50,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Because anything less is just another day at the office. We remember the days when return on investment meant doing something we’d never forget. Like the days when we tapped our toes on the gymnasium floor and wondered, hoped, and prayed the smile coming from the shy face across the room was an invitation. So, we walked over to find out. We remember when doing something worthwhile meant making a move, taking a stand, and living, learning, fighting toward a dream. We remember being young and daring and because we remember, we haven’t yet grown all the way up. Of course, we’re business types now. We have checkbooks to balance, mortgages to pay, and some of us even have kids who will soon conceal a wild heart under a gifted corsage. But at Brand Fuel, we refuse to surrender sight of the days when a memory was a win and a “yes,” and success was an impenetrable moat surrounding a 6-foot sand castle. We know it’s emotion that drives decisions—the meaningful ones—and it’s bold strides that elicit the strongest rewards. We set out each day to unite all of the senses and forge a feeling your audience can never forget. We can do the simple, the routine. We can keep standing over here, tapping our toes to the rhythm in the floorboards waiting, or we can set out, together, and chase ideas that defy ordinary and inspire. We aim this high every day because we think the world’s already got enough people out there striving to just get by. Sure, the music has changed over the years, as we have. Our own corsages were long ago replaced with sweaty Ramones t-shirts and torn jeans, outfits that now hide in attics above pink rooms full of stuffed animals and giggling kids. Yeah, we’ve matured, honed the vision. But we fight to remember. Each day we cling to the notion that making something great, something that lasts, starts with the warm spark of emotion. Come be brave with us and make tomorrow nothing like today. It’s time to do something worth remembering.","Clothing and Apparel, Commerce and Shopping, Content and Publishing, Design, Media and Entertainment, Sales and Marketing, Transportation",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The problem we solve : It is challenging today for small to medium sized livestock producers to collect and record accurate data on their animals and then act on that data to improve the profitability of their operation and health care for their animals. Our mission : Improve animal welfare and farmer profitability through an affordable and easy to use integrated hardware and software management solution.  To make it easy and inexpensive for livestock farmers to collect and understand their animals important data metrics and make smart educated decisions so their ranches can grow and flourish. To assist small to medium sized grass-fed livestock producers compete against large industrial producers who use factory farming technology to mass produce meat using hormones, steroids, antibiotics and processed feeds with no concern for animal welfare and provenance. Assist Livestock Farmers : ✓ Confidently build their dreams ✓ Grow to provide more jobs and support their community ✓ Share their values without fear ✓ Stop struggling and start growing Why is AgriEID so much less expensive ? ✓ We are 100% online so no sales commissions are paid to the traditional rural store networks ✓ We do not employ a team of expensive field sales reps ✓ We are 100% private so we don't have to pay dividends to shareholders ✓ We reinvest 100% of our profits back into the business to offer increasing value to our customers We are focused on growing our strong network of loyal customers and we understand that price is an important consideration for all hardworking folks living on the land. The AgriEID Story : For years we struggled to grow our cattle operation because there was no affordable computer system that allowed us to track and measure our livestock performance and profitability over time. Not even the established complicated and expensive solutions available on the market provided anywhere near the functionality and ease of use required to run a small to medium sized operation efficiently in 2022. This is WHY our local team has worked so hard over many years to design and build a better system which is now known as the AgriEID Digital Ranch System. We are revolutionising the grass fed livestock industry by making it effortless to collect animal data and act on it with the most advanced analytics tools available on any device - mobile, tablet and desktop. If you currently rely on best guestimates and crave the important data points required to grow your livestock business - then AgriEID is going to be the integrated solution you have been searching for over the years. Stop guessing and start using a system built from the ground up by cattle ranchers for small to medium sized producers. Large commercial ranchers have been using sophisticated EID digital systems and livestock management software for years to maximise operating efficiency and profitability. These legacy livestock management systems are cumbersome, outdated, expensive and require extensive product training, installation and ongoing technology support services. AgriEID combines low cost hardware (RFID Ear Tag Readers and Digital Weigh Scales) with a powerful cloud based Software platform that delivers a comprehensive and affordable livestock management solution direct to your iPad or tablet as you work on animals in real-time. We provide livestock producers with powerful analytics so their operations can be improved over time by focusing on top performing animals and ensuring the health of their animals is maximised for improved profitability. At AgriEID we work hard every day to assist American Ranchers of all ages to transition from pencil and paper to an easy to use digital management system with low cost optional hardware configurations. We are focused on delivering the right livestock monitoring technology and management tools at affordable prices to boost on-ranch production efficiencies. We provide easy to use and inexpensive management solutions to improve compliance and the profitability of your ranch over time. All our products are tested on farm in harsh working conditions and are guaranteed to be fully compliant with the USDA 840 EID tagging system 5,000+ livestock producers use our market leading electronic hardware and software solutions on a daily basis to manage 150,000+ head of cattle.
