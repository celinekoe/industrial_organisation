They originally developed the DAPPER power system analysis software on a mainframe at the UCLA Computer Center. By 1978, DAPPER was running in time-share mode on the Control Data Corporation mainframe, and being used by engineers both in the United States and internationally. The first PC version of DAPPER was released in 1981, followed in 1983 by the CAPTOR time current coordination software. A_FAULT was developed in 1988 and IEC_FAULT in 1991, to provide ANSI and IEC-909 fault calculations, respectively. The dynamic simulation program I*SIM and the harmonic analysis program HI_WAVE filled out the DOS-based product line in 1992. In 1995, SKM released Power*Tools for Windows (PTW) - completely built from ground up using the latest Windows development tools. The new Windows PTW line of software offers the same powerful studies that have been available in DOS, but adds greater flexibility, enhanced ease of use, and graphical functions not available in DOS. PTW was first released in December 1995 with the base DAPPER and CAPTOR modules. A_FAULT, IEC_FAULT and TMS were added the following year. HI_WAVE was added in 1998, I*SIM in 1999, and the Device Evaluation module in 2000. The Ground Grid, Reliability and Single-Phase/Unbalanced 3-Phase studies were all added in 2001. Throughout the development process, the PTW interface has continually expanded and improved, to provide maximum flexibility and ultimate ease-of-use.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Manufacturing, Software",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Freedom House supports non-violent civic initiatives in societies where freedom is denied or under threat and promotes the right of all people to be free.   Its founders were a diverse group of Americans: journalists, business and labor leaders, academics, and former government officials. Among its early leaders was Wendell Willkie, the Republican presidential nominee in 1940. Eleanor Roosevelt was also a supporter and served, along with Willkie, as the organization’s first co-chair.   Having been created in response to the threat of Nazism, Freedom House took up the struggle against Communism in twentieth century after the end of World War II. Since its founding, Freedom House has helped shape the debate on the most pressing issues of its time.    Throughout its history, Freedom House has included among its leadership prominent civil rights leaders; notably Roy Wilkins, the director of the NAACP and Bayard Rustin, a leading adviser to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.   Freedom House acts as a catalyst for freedom through a combination of analysis, advocacy, and action. Their research and analysis frames the policy debate in the United States and abroad on the progress and decline of freedom.

Many entrepreneurs find that their angel funding takes them only so far. At the same time, most established venture funds are gravitating toward larger investments in later-stage companies. As a result, many worthy young companies find themselves caught in the â€œcapital gap.â€ The Lacuna Venture Fund is a new kind of venture fund focused on providing Gap Capitalâ„¢ of $500,000 to $3 million to dynamic early-stage companies that are ready to go to market, but that need the next level of financial and advisory resources to succeed. The Lacuna Hedge Fund invests in select small-cap and micro-cap public companies that fall into the â€œinformation gapâ€ which occurs when small companies are overlooked by Wall Street and the investing public.

BeagleBoard.org provides a forum for the owners and developers of open-source software and hardware to exchange ideas, knowledge and experience. On occasion, BeagleBoard.org provides for the promotion of communication with other individuals interested in open-source software and hardware. BeagleBoard.org is the result of an effort by a collection of passionate individuals, including several employees of Texas Instruments, interested in creating powerful, open, and embedded devices. We invite you to participate and become part of BeagleBoard.org, defining its direction. Support for BeagleBoard.org boards comes from the very active development community through this website, the mailing list, and the IRC channel. Original production funding was provided by Digi-Key, a major international distributor, but distribution has now been opened up to dozens of distributors across the world. On-going funding for board prototypes has been provided by manufacturing partners. Texas Instruments generously allows Jason Kridner, community manager and software cat herder, to spend time to provide support and development of the BeagleBoard.org project as part of their duties at TI. Manufacturing partners pay volume prices for the TI (and all other) components. BeagleBoard.org licenses the use of BeagleBoard.org logos for use as part of the Manufacturer, Compliant and Compatible logo programs . BeagleBoard.org also participates as a mentoring organization for Google Summer of Code which pays a small fee for mentoring students. The first five BeagleBoard.org designs (BeagleBoard, BeagleBoard-xM, BeagleBone, BeagleBone Black and BeagleBoard-X15) where all executed by BeagleBoard.org co-founder Gerald Coley of EmProDesign. All the designs are fully open source and components are available for anyone to manufacture compatible hardware. We do request contact and permission before considering the use of the BeagleBoard.org name on any products. The boards are low-cost, fan-less single-board computers based on low-power Texas Instruments processors featuring the ARM Cortex-A series core with all of the expandability of today's desktop machines, but without the bulk, expense, or noise. Initially, development was targeted at enabling Linux distributions to improve support for ARM devices. With tremendous success and support by numerous Linux distributions, development has become more focused on enabling simplified physical computing on advanced GUI-enabled and/or networked-enabled devices with a super-simple out-of-box learning experience and support for development environments familiar to just about every developer, from Ubuntu, QNX, Windows Embedded, Android and web tools to bare metal and even Arduino/Wiring-style programming.","Education, Hardware, Platforms, Science and Engineering, Software",1,Jason Kridner,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
