Thingle.me makes it beautifully simpler! We identify each product with a unique Thingle ID (TID) associated to a specific model and serial number. The TID may be physical (e.g.: a QR-code label or a NFC tag) or virtual (i.e.: a string in the product’s firmware or in the product’s mobile app).  The end user taps the tag (or scans the QR-code, etc.) with her smartphone and accesses a web application through which the user can: A) Activate the service, giving location and contacts information and eventually uploading a pic of the proof of purchase, with additional data about retailer, price, other purchases etc. B) Browse all and only the documents, Q&As, video tutorials related to her product and aimed at her, which maybe different for those available to a technician.  C) Request support, via direct call, request to be called back or filling a form, depending on what the customer service center can handle. NOTE: Thingle.me does not require downloading any specific, additional mobile app. BENEFITS FOR THE MANUFACTURER: 1) Know who purchased what from whom, where their products are and who uses them. Offering end-users a seamlessly natural and hassle-free experience, Thingle.me accelerates the construction of the customer database. 2) Track support requests along the value chain. Manufacturers can outsource your customer support operations without losing contact with their users. 3) Ensure consistent service quality. Manufacturers can guarantee service levels across the board, no matter how large and organized their local partners are. They can monitor service centers’ and technical support centers’ performance and reward them accordingly. 4) Increase customer support efficiency. Tickets are automatically routed to the appropriate service center – e.g.: by time geography, product and language - and no ticket is going to be missed again. Moreover, pre-qualification of tickets, with location, product info, user contact details provide the right contest for customer support agents to be faster in solving problems. 5) Increase customer satisfaction. Thingle.me is the easiest and most natural way for end-users to find relevant information and to receive the required support. No more googling of manuals, desperate research of receipts, waiting endlessly on the phone, navigating complex IVR systems, or seeking of hidden ciphers (i.e.: model and serial number) on the product.","Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Internet Services, Navigation and Mapping, Other, Professional Services, Software",2,"Carlo Alberto Degli Atti, Stefania Bertocchi",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

How does it work: ● Each photo posted is enriched by a location and an icon that defines the moment category and how long you will be physically in that place (eg: ""I’m having lunch at Kreation in Venice Beach for 45 minutes more""). Once the photo is posted, the countdown starts. The photos that are still in the countdown period are listed in the “In Progress"" filter. ● According to their current distance, different users will see different interaction features: the closer they will be able to get, before the countdown ends, the more their menu will enrich with new interaction features and content adding capabilities. ● The main functions are 12. The 5 “basic” functions are always available to anyone (Comment, Like, Share, Invite, Get Updates), while the other 7 functions (Approach, Check-in, Synch, Add Photos, Connect, Chat, Unlock Promotion) are progressively activated according to how close one is getting. Specifically: ""Approach"" is active beyond 18 mi, ""Check-in"" between 18 mi and 430 yd, ""Synch"" within 430 yd, ""Connect"", ""Add Photo"" and ""Unlock Promotion"" get activated only after a ”Synch"" is confirmed.  The chat begins to be available only after you have made a ”Connect"" with someone. The more people interact during countdown period, the more the photo gets popular, and to be more specific, the more the interactions are made with features like “Synch”, “Connect” and “Add Photo”, the more popular it will get. This probably makes it sound like the comments and likes you usually receive on your photos, seem quite a thing of the distant past ! ● Connect works like this: when people are physically in the place where the photo was posted, they can confirm ""Synch"", afterwards they become ""available"" in the Connect list. The Connect allows to establish that you just entered in a space-time proximity relationship with another person, and from that point on, you can start a chat conversation (eg, “Is it you the one sitting at the table with the cuban cigar? May I come to drink my beer with you?). The ""Add Photo"" allows you to add your photos into that particular album created by someone else: for example if you are both at a crowded party, many people can share their photos of the evening into one collaborative album. Create collaborative photo albums with strangers immediately establishes a special relationship. Which works a lot better than 300 messages. The ""Unlock Promotion"" feature will make you get a lot of cool things at a discounted price, and you may also have your purchase validated to have other benefits. ● Anything relevant that happens after you have posted the photo it will create lots of updates and push notifications. So if you are about to share a photo of yourself riding a bicycle at sunset on Instagram, you should consider to post it on expreem too, at least if you want to receive more intriguing push notifications for, let’s say, 30 minutes. Someone very close may add a photo of the amazing sunset, and may connect to you - “meet me at Pier 21!”. ● Search by places of interest, discounts, type of activity, followed people, and more... A tip: at the beginning, especially if expreem is not very famous in your area, it may seem impossible to activate features like Synch, Connect and the Chat, so I strongly encourage you to ask your best friends to download the app and to try it when you are together: one of you can post a photo and the others can try the “Synch” and the “Add Photos”.

SureSpeak,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/surespeak,"Corporate Training, Online Portals, SaaS, Tutoring","Chicago, Illinois, United States",SureSpeak is a web-based coaching platform aimed at solving the current inefficiencies and costs associated with corporate training.,"1,343,963","Greater Chicago Area, Great Lakes, Midwestern US",,Closed,2007-01-01,year,2003-12-01,day,,none,For Profit,http://www.surespeak.com,"SureSpeak is a web based coaching platform aimed at solving the current inefficiencies and costs associated with corporate training. The Problem Companies spend billions of dollars each year on training and coaching-in 2006 over $129 billion. However, this training is often ineffective or very expensive or both.  Ineffective-Studies show that after 4 weeks, 85% of what was learned in a classroom setting is forgotten. Additionally, teaching interpersonal and communication skills in a classroom environment is rarely effective. Lastly, scheduling conflicts often cause inefficiency and delay in connecting a person in need of coaching and a coach.  Expensive - Companies spend money on travel, lodging, meals and other related costs in order to get people to training sessions. Companies also deploy e-learning solutions which offer little or no interaction or practice and suffer from miserable completion rates. Additionally, current market conditions have caused the majority of enterprises to cut training and travel budgets significantly and look for cost effective means to deliver training enterprise-wide. The Solution SureSpeak is a Software as a Service (SaaS) provider of web-based video coaching platform and tools. Executive coaches & enterprises use SureSpeak to improve sales, presentation and communication skills leading to enhanced revenues, higher customer retention and improved operating efficiencies. SureSpeak users watch modeling videos that demonstrate desired performance — for example ""How to close the sale."" Then with just an internet connection and a webcam, the user records their version and self-reviews. Typically the user will re-record multiple times until satisfied (current record to save ratio is 6:1). Practicing or role-playing in a private setting has proven to be very desirable for SureSpeak users as opposed to group role-playing which is embarrassing and counter-productive. When the user is satisfied with his ""SureSpeak"" he saves, and his coach receives an automatic email alert notifying him that a SureSpeak is waiting for review. The coach then logs in from wherever he may be and whenever he has time. This is a key to the efficiency of SureSpeak. The coach provides feedback in written form, in score format — based on customizable categories such as body language, tone, enthusiasm, message content, sincerity, etc. The coach also can record a video back to the user. When the coach saves his feedback the system notifies the user that his score SureSpeak has been reviewed, and likewise the user logs in when convenient to review. Additionally, each user can receive feedback from unlimited coaches, peers, managers, etc. SureSpeak's patented platform is unique in that it is asynchronous — meaning the practice and coaching is split up into 3 distinct parts — practice, coaching/feedback, and review of feedback. These can be done independent of each other without delay and at any time. Most training fails in that no video record is provided and if it is not efficient or readily accessible online and cannot be shared. Synchronous training solutions such as video-conference fail as they still require both parties to be available at the same time.","Education, Internet Services, Software",1,Darren Schwartz,1-10,1,M&A,1600000,USD,1600000,1600000,USD,1600000,David Kalt,,1,,Private,,,,,,
