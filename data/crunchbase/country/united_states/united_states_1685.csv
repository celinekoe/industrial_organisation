The standard approach to acquiring a new car involves the luck of the draw, based solely upon what's available on the lot. Nowadays, that kind of old-fashioned business model simply doesn't make sense — why remain limited to what happens to be on sale at one specific business? Our model instead allows for maximum flexibility, drawing upon the resources available in the Philadelphia area.  We can secure financing and work out details in order to acquire the car that suits you best. We'll help you price out models and options, and even if you're experiencing bankruptcy or have a low credit score, we can find something to fit your budget. There's no pressure, because we're not trying to empty our lot — we just want to find something that suits you best. For your peace of mind, most of our vehicles come with a 30-day engine and transmission warranty. And this is not all, you can extend it up to 4 years and be covered, just in case of an unexpected break down.
