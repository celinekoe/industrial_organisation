Working with the large backup software vendors to understand how data was written to tape and alongside corporations to see how they stored and used data gave eMag an insight into all aspects of tape-based data from the manufacture of the product through to the way an organisation stored and restored information. Late in the 20th century, as the global manufacturing base moved to the Far East, eMag used this unique insight to develop a suite of services designed to support tape and data stored upon it. Key to this development was the purchase and integration of intermedia, a company specialising in the restoration of data from media without using the original backup software. Their product, MM/PC became the core engine used to support all services providing the ability to access, catalogue and restore tapes of any type and any format.","Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Software",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
