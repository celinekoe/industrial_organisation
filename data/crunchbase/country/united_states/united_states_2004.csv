VASCO has approximately 10,000 customers in more than 100 countries, including more than 1,700 financial institutions. In 2013, VASCO was recognized as a “leader” in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for User Authentication.  Two-factor authentication - Website users click on the “MYDIGIPASS.COM secure login” button for two-factor authentication to protect access to services and content. Two-factor authentication employs something the user knows (like a password or PIN) and something they possess (like a mobile device or a laptop). Users enter their chosen passwords or PINs, and then use a One Time Password (OTP) either delivered to their mobile devices, generated by the laptop or by a standalone device. The OTP can only be used once and is only valid for a limited period of time. It’s the same technology used by financial institutions to secure transactions and accounts. Banking-level security - MYDIGIPASS.COM encrypts data in transit between users, application service providers and MYDIGIPASS.COM via SSL or TLS using 256 bits AES. The MYDIGIPASS.COM cloud infrastructure is hosted in ISO 27001 certified data centers. Mobile client authenticators have device binding using the mobile devices’ unique identifier. The data is delivered and stored encrypted. Some laptops integrate an Intel IPT secured chip that provides highly secure storage of data. Deployment process - Integrating the MYDIGIPASS.COM API on a website requires no architectural changes. The solution uses the OAuth 2.0 IETF standard. No provisioning or management is needed because the service is managed in the cloud by VASCO.  The MYDIGIPASS.COM API provides user interface consistency across multiple end-user devices.  Cloud-based service - MYDIGIPASS.COM is hosted in multiple cloud-based infrastructure data centers spread across the United States and Europe. The users’ data are not shared between the United States and Europe to preserve the users’ privacy. Companies do not need on-site hardware/software or personnel. VASCO manages all security validations in the cloud. Customer examples: Monizze, InfoCert Legalmail, Stearn.eu, WhitePaperCentral.com",Privacy and Security,,,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Through its strong online network, Hair Library is the ultimate source for discovering and selling great hair products. Its passionate community of hair stylists, beauty bloggers, hair-care lovers and manufacturers are united across the globe to revolutionize and personalize the way people approach hair-care in the new-generation. Employing a patent pending technology, Hair Library matches users with products based on their hair type and texture. With a mission to meet the diversity of hair-care needs, this technology presents a seamless and simple solution to finding the right product. This sophisticated system offers over 1,000 products, ensuring that users can locate the perfect match to answer their specific hair-care needs. Hair Library embraces user-generated media, which allows its users to exchange experiences with various hair-care products. Users can tag and review products by sharing their hair story. These hair stories follow with the products throughout the library, helping inspire and guide other consumers in their journey to find the ideal hair-care product. With the contribution of consumer feedback, Hair Library’s technology allows brands to be acknowledged by the quality of their products’ performance instead of flashy and expensive marketing plans. It also gives emerging brands a chance to shine, despite not having the same national retail distribution and marketing budgets as more established brands. The inspiration to create Hair Library was sparked by a desire to transform and improve traditional marketing strategies used by many beauty brands, which is usually based on ethnicity instead of texture and hair type. Soho Analytics Inc. Founder & CEO, Morgan R. Gantt, understood this need and created HairLibrary.com. Born of her personal struggle to find hair-care products that fit her unique needs, she felt frustrated with expense of experimenting with choosing products solely based on it’s described used on the label. This method of trial and error can be an expensive undertaking, and can also be damaging to hair. For this reason, Hair Library was created, ignited by a passion to connect people with great hair-care brands that meet their needs. Gantt received a Bachelor Of Fine Arts with a concentration of Photography from Long Island University; she channels this artistic background in everything she does. During her experience as a Digital New Business Development Consultant for Hype Hair Magazine, she was able to apply her insights and innovations to direct marketing strategies. Throughout her career, Morgan has worked with major beauty labels such as Juicy, Today’s Black Woman & Pop Star. In addition Morgan is the author of The Lace Wig Bible: How To Style, Care & Maintain Lace Wigs Without Sacrificing Your Natural Hair, published in 2012 (Available at Amazon.com).","Commerce and Shopping, Data and Analytics",1,Morgan R.

The area offers great potential for growth and value-added projects, as noted in several market study reports, highlighted below: “St. George is the fastest-growing metropolitan area in the U.S., according to new estimates from the Census Bureau.

Commercial office rents have doubled over the past two years in several downtown commercial developments.  The Fund closed three buildings in the historic and arts district, Ancestor Square in December 2019. The property contains approximately 21,000 square feet of rentable space and is partially leased with rent escalation clauses and is currently cash-flowing. The Fund is working on substantially improving the Ancestor Square buildings as required under the QOZ legislation.
