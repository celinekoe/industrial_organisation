Touted by industry experts as the most innovative of the VoIP delivery models, UCaaS delivers a comprehensive solution that includes hosted VoIP and hosted unified communications functionalityâ€”all delivered and managed by a single provider. This new paradigm delivers the best of todayâ€™s communications options to companies whose size, budget, and technical expertise would normally prevent them from utilizing this productivity-enhancing technology.  Much like the SaaS model, businesses pay for usage, not ownership. Cypressâ€™ UCaaS solution, C4 IP, provides businesses with comprehensive, flexible and scalable options.  The bundled service includes integrated voice and data access, phones, local and long distance, voicemail, PBX calling features such as caller ID, call forwarding and call waiting, and advanced unified communications functionality such as video calling, Web collaboration, chat, presence and unified messaging. C4 IP requires little internal oversight, so firms can easily reallocate IT budget and personnel resources to where theyâ€™ll create the most business growth and value. In addition to easing the technological burden on the small to mid-sized enterprise (SME), C4 IP also brings with it increased flexibility, scalability and reliability. Cypress takes on the challenge of keeping up with the rapid evolution of communications technologies, bringing advances and new applications to SMEs faster than if they attempted it themselves. And, since the SME is not responsible for creating and maintaining the communications infrastructure, the solution can be scaled up or down as the business changes without any additional investments in hardware or software. The inherent business continuity guaranteed by Cypressâ€˜ robust network infrastructures also ensures that SMEs can continue working productively in the face of any situation.","Hardware, Information Technology, Internet Services, Messaging and Telecommunications, Software",,,501-1000,1,M&A,53500000,USD,53500000,53500000,USD,53500000,"AEW Capital Management, Transwestern, Nassau Capital, Gramercy Communications Partners, Latona Cycom Investment",,5,,Private,,,,,,
