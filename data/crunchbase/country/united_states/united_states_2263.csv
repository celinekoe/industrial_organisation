Our world today is confronted with a multitude of global challenges in every area—health, education, environment, poverty, and global relations. Critically, these problems are measurable, substantial and growing over time. Take a look around the world: 4 billion people live on less than $4/day; 700 million adults cannot read; millions of children die each year of curable diseases because they lack access to clean water and basic healthcare; the environment is changing, perhaps irrevocably, and political sites of conflict around the globe erupt in violence every day. Take a look at the issues pervading American society: public education is mediocre; energy demands continue to grow; environmental challenges abound; health goals are not met; economic growth barely stirs as our recession strengthens glaring socioeconomic disparities. At the same time, studies demonstrate current weaknesses in philanthropic practices: At home, philanthropy is vigorous but uncertain, hopeful but diffuse. Nearly $100 billion is wasted each year due to duplication of efforts, competition for resources, and difficulty identifying best practice. Given the extensive challenges we face, we can’t afford to waste any philanthropic assets. We must identify best strategies to leverage resources and ensure that every dollar is used most effectively.","Other, Social Impact",1,Leonard Kaplan,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

We Are Strictly Insurance Sales Trainers, Coaches and Mentors for new and experienced advisors. We are NOT Recruiters!!! Our Mission… To help you... to help middle-income families to ‘find the money’ to spend, save, invest, insure and plan wisely for the future, to “Live Debt Free and Truly Wealthy!” Our Goal… To help you become the most recognized and sought after advisor in your local community! Our Philosophy… If you help enough people to get what they want, then you’ll get what you want! MessageLew Nason,,, Insurance Sales Trainer, coach and Mentor... ""The 9 Out of 10 Guy"" From Our Founder Lew Nason… Like most agents, I struggled when I started in insurance sales in 1982. But, then I got extremely lucky, because I had three very successful producers take me under their wings. First of all, they taught me how to consistently find and attract my ‘Ideal’ insurance leads, by getting a message out of how I was really helping people. Then, I learned how to ask the right questions. So, I was able to consistently set high-quality appointments and close sales with ‘9 out of 10’ of those ‘IDEAL’ insurance leads. As a result, I quickly became a top producer. (Thank You, Mike, Phil & Ron!) Then, over the years, my sons and I were very fortunate to meet and learn from many industry’s super achievers. Now, it’s my turn to give back to this great insurance industry. Accordingly, my family and I would like to pass all this vital insurance sales training on to you!  Lew Nason, RFC, LUTCF… “The 9 Out Of 10 Guy”, Insurance Sales Trainer, Coach… Mentor About the Insurance Pro Shop (IPS)… In December of 1999, my sons and I decided to open the Insurance Pro Shop! Because we recognized that most of the insurance sales trainers, companies, and IMOs were only teaching agents and advisors how to sell their products. When instead, they should have been teaching them how to really help people! So, in 1999 we became the first and only full service, insurance sales trainers strictly dedicated to helping individual insurance professionals. However, unlike most of the other insurance sales trainers today, we decided NOT to be recruiters in disguise! Now, for over 3 decades, my family has been training, coaching, mentoring and supporting ‘new’ and ‘experienced’ career and independent insurance agents, financial advisors, and Multi Line agents. From 1983-1999 as a manager and general agent, Lew recruited and trained hundreds of insurance agents and financial advisors. Then since 1999, as insurance sales trainers, coaches and mentors, the Insurance Pro Shop has helped thousands to successfully sell life insurance and annuities! The great news is… we have a proven record of helping our clients to dramatically increase their sales… In as little as 60 days! And it is because all those agents and advisors are now focusing on really helping their prospects, clients, friends, and family!",Education,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Terrain was founded in 2015 by Mike Agnich and Charles Tripp.  They noticed that many e-commerce professionals were struggling to implement algorithms to better manage their e-commerce channels.  While the marketers and channel managers knew what steps they needed to take to improve channel performance, they found that much of the technical capability required to optimize e-commerce offers were held by the IT teams.  Consequently, projects took longer, cost more and had a lower likelihood of succeeding than was ideal. Today, Terrain’s mission is to put algorithm success in the hands of e-commerce managers and marketers so they can drive improved performance, higher conversions and more profitability.   Our customers are seeing 5% - 20%+ improvements in key e-commerce conversion metrics, and are developing powerful new processes that allow them to challenge the most advanced competitors in their industries.
