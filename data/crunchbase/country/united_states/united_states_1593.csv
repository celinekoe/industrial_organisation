Gregg recognized that large enterprises selling complex, consultative products and services, like mortgages or insurance, had made significant investments in their e-business and in their sales and service organizations - but for some reason the two weren't connected. His belief was that if the two were connected, the enterprises would see a significant increase in revenue while delivering superior customer service and a better customer online experience. With this belief in mind, he assembled a group of professionals with decades of experience creating and delivering solutions to large enterprises, to create a strategic business solution to meet these objectives.
