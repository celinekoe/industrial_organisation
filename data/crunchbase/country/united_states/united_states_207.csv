Dr. Weisberg is an expert with 30 years of experience in spinal corrective care and injury prevention. The HeadRight® is a perfect orthopedic pillow designed by Dr. Weisberg after a lot of research on postures and sleeping positions. After all the research on spinal corrective care, Dr. Weisberg analyzed that a perfect spinal support pillow for ""back sleeping"" requires a totally different design from that required for the perfect ""side sleeping"" support pillow. So, he produced The HeadRight®, which is a perfect orthopedic pillow. The HeadRight® is the new computer designed biometric alternate for normal pillow. Neck and back pain, poor posture or other serious conditions like Forward Head Posture (FHP) can be easily treated and cured with The HeadRight®. It helps to realign the head and spine and also offers corrective support system in the spinal recovery process.  The unique biomechanical design makes The HeadRight® the only ""pillow"" that provides the exact support needed to encourage optimum spinal alignment. It is the best orthopedic pillow which can also be used to reduce damaging pressure and stress on the nervous system, ease tensions, improve spinal range of motion and flexibility, prevent spinal injury as you sleep and provide better and healthier sleep. The HeadRight® pillow design incorporated three separate and distinct support surfaces. Irrespective of what position you sleep in, ""The HeadRight®' is a 'smart pillow' as it seems to know how and where to place each of its 3 perfectly contoured surfaces in order to perfectly support both side and back sleeping positions.  The HeadRight® promotes health through functional improvements of the spine, nervous system and body. It is much more than a pillow and the best way to cure neck and back pain.
