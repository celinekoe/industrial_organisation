To name a few, it can be used by Girl Scouts to sell cookies, food trucks to broadcast their exact location, bands to sell merchandise at live events, bars to accept cover, organizations to crowdfund, and so forth. By using advanced location technology, Moulah is able to pinpoint your location when you have the app open and display everything around you that you can pay. Both the people collecting money and paying have to have the Moulah app, and be within 2 miles of each other. The onboarding process is extremely simple and it takes no more than a couple minutes to set up an account. To collect money, you have to apply and a member of Team Moulah approves everyone on an individual basis to make sure you are real, safe, and intend to use Moulah in a legitimate way. Once you are approved, you can create listings in the app, by clicking on “My Listings”. Complete your listing by adding a picture, description, address, and the start/end time. During the times the listing is active, anyone within a 2 mile radius can see it, and if applicable, pay.  To pay, all you have to do is download the app, create an account and add a credit or debit card. Moulah is developed with security in mind. We use industry standard end-to-end encryption technologies to protect your data as it is being transmitted across our system, so you can be sure your information is protected in transit.
