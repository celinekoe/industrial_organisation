The need for a steady shot forced our hand and we begrudgingly chose the tripod. By the end of the hike the extra weight made us feel like we needed both a chiropractor and a cardiologist. We searched for a light, small and practical mini tripod for shooting in the field but couldn’t find anything able to support a DSLR camera with a heavy lens. After several jury-rigging attempts at attaching a tripod head to a metal plate with stud adapters, the solution hit us and we began manufacturing a simple, sturdy and flat plate that could support even the heaviest of photo equipment. Thus, at 4 mm thick the world’s most compact mini tripod, was born. Platypod Pro LLC is a small and family owned business committed to making excellent quality products for professional photographers at affordable prices. We believe our unique and simple design makes the Platypod Pro an extremely versatile piece of equipment, that’s usefulness is as vast as the user’s creativity.
