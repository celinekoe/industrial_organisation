Crypto-economic stakes for all parties ensure fast, high-quality work and fair rates. Mentat enables anyone, from anywhere in the world, to offer their skills and knowledge in exchange for instant payment. By allowing applications to delegate only value-adding human intelligence tasks, the value of agents’ time is increased, while also improving the business efficiency of participating applications.

In large part, their well being depended upon the fruits of these waterways which were also the highways of the day. In 1907, the Federal Government established the Upper Lake Rancheria in Upper Lake, California (a very small Rancheria) for the benefit of a group of homeless and landless Pomo Indians in the Clear Lake area. The U. S. Government held title to the land into Trust for them until 1958. During the early 1950s, the U. S. Government took steps to terminate its trust relationship with all Indian Tribes, including those in California. The Upper Lake Band of Pomo Indians were forced off its impoverished tribal lands about 50 years ago under the Federal Government’s Indian Relocation program. Around 20 years ago, the Federal Government began permitting California Indians to return to their former lands. For some, like Upper Lake, California, the land was no longer available. Today, federal law permits such Tribes such as Upper Lake to find a suitable site for restoration of its tribal activities and business operations near its aboriginal tribal lands.
