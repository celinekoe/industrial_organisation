Zephyr’s wind generator has several competitive advantages including a simple, low cost design, compact form factor, and silent operation. A low cut-in wind speed allows the generator to produce electricity at reduced elevations and in environments unsuitable for wind turbines. Zephyr plans to enter the market with a miniature wind generator product that will meet the low power needs of wireless sensor network (WSN) devices and consumer electronics applications. The industrial WSN market doubled from 2010 to 2012, and is expected to grow 553% by 2017 with over 24 million wireless-enabled sensors installed. A recent industry survey revealed that only 28% of WSN adopters are satisfied with the battery life of their wireless sensor devices. The use of low-power energy harvesting for WSN applications is widespread and increasing annually. Zephyr is seeking funding and/or corporate partners to accelerate the commercialization of its technology. Zephyr’s team is comprised of engineers and business advisors with decades of entrepreneurship and business experience.

For some it's their bread and butter, like news organizations, for others it's a way to connect and stay relevant. Some merely need content to drive SEO to their websites. The problem with content is that it requires skills and time to research and write content, and it has to be done on a continuous basis. The job never ends. In addition content is not just text, it requires images, charts, graphs, interactive elements or videos to increase engagement and interest. Creating this is expensive because it takes time, requires specific skills, and has to be performed on an ongoing basis. We have built a  SAAS solution which allow customers to browse a broad range of news articles written by our system. Customers can also create custom content with a few simple inputs in a matter of seconds or minutes. Our content comes ready-to-publish and comes in various formats needed for online publications, such as HTML, plain text, AMP, etc. We also include a variety of media (Images, charts, graphs, video or interactive content), all of which is also created by our systems. Compared to content farms where an article can take days/weeks to be written, we save the customers time and money and allow them to publish much more for much less. Our goal is to provide a constantly growing set of categories and on-demand content, as well as a set of online tools for external content that can be used to augment it.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment, Sales and Marketing, Software",1,Anders Heie,1-10,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
