What makes Express Fit unique is our focus on results - not memberships.  We use the latest equipment and sophisticated electronics record the details of every rep on every workout. Our trainers use this information to counsel our clients and fine tune their workout.  This leads to more consistent strength gains and fat loss and thus better client satisfaction. This form of exercise has proven to be the most efficient possible - providing the same strength gains and cardiovascular improvements traditional weight training and cardio combined, in a tiny fraction of the time.   We offer the safest, most effective and most efficient exercise modality on the market and we aim to be the most convenient.  While the huge gyms are focused on what amounts to do-it-yourself sports entertainment, our focus is client fitness. We envision a world where Express Fit studios are nearly as common as Starbucks and servicing a similar clientele: the busy professionals/soccer moms who simply don't have time and energy for traditional, time consuming workouts such as running, biking or swimming. Our first Express Fit studio opened in April of 2013 in Teaneck, NJ, a small, NYC suburb.  We have grown rapidly to several hundred clients with only modest advertising and promotion.
