To imagine how it would work pretend that facebook and wikipedia had a child. when you enter the main site you will see a story line of occurrences much like the facebook news feed.But instead of the latest rants and check ins of your friends you will see the real life events of historical figures.Unlike facebook, this site will borrow the original attributes of wikipedia. No one will have a personal account, instead anyone will be able to add a life event of any known character. Each event that one will post, at least initially will be confined to a predetermined collection of event types.For example birth, death, battles won or lost, music composed, war started treaty signed, novel written...This will guide the creators to actual, factual occurrences and prevent the usual bias and interpretation. To control for less relevant details we will create a significance indicator that will be populated by the reader.Also to account for garbage posts we will create an accuracy measure which will again be determined by the reader.Each event will allow the creator to link a reference in order to justify their claim.And the reader will be able to filter out events based on lack of reference or low significance or accuracy. The structure of this website will allow the public to generate precise historical timelines and make detailed history more accessible to view, write and interpret its significance and accuracy.Thus eliminating the influence of the victors on history. Unlike wikipedia the site's database structure will allow more detail, precision and perhaps future visualization capability.This is not a substitute for history books just a new resource to navigate and compile historical events for ease of understanding.","Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
