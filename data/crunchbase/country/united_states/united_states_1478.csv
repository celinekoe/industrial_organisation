Whether the script or project is a low budget film or a blockbuster movie, studios, private investors, insurance companies and bonding companies will always require a budget.  The two current options to buy a budget are either to hire aÂ Unit Production Manager (UPM) or to buy budgeting software.  A UPM will charge at least $1,000 and take a month to deliver the budget. Budgeting software is  expensive, complicated to learn, and extremely tedious to use.   QFB automates the process by asking several key questions to instantly deliver a professional customized film budget for $99. After the user answers these questions, the website creates the budget using a matrix that was derived from approximately one hundred thousand calculus based algorithms.  These algorithms are the result of analysis of many produced filmsâ€™ budgets that ranged in every genre and total budget.  This analysis discovered that these pertinent questions have a direct effect on the budget.  Furthermore, it yielded the quantitative relationships between total budget, genre, and the other questions.
