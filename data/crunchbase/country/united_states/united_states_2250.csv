Teamsters,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/teamsters,"Association, Non Profit","Washington, District of Columbia, United States",Teamsters mission is to organize and educate workers towards a higher standard of living.,"171,140","Washington DC Metro Area, Southern US",$1M to $10M,Active,1903-01-01,year,,,,,Non-profit,https://teamster.org/,"The Teamsters Union is North America's strongest and most diverse labor union. In 1903, the Teamsters started as a merger of the two leading team driver associations. These drivers were the backbone of America’s robust economic growth, but they needed to organize to wrest their fair share from greedy corporations. Today, the Union’s task is exactly the same.  The Teamsters are known as the champion of freight drivers and warehouse workers, but have organized workers in virtually every occupation imaginable, both professional and non-professional, private sector and public sector.  Our 1.4 million members are public defenders in Minnesota; vegetable workers in California; sanitation workers in New York; brewers in St. Louis; newspaper workers in Seattle; construction workers in Las Vegas; zoo keepers in Pennsylvania; healthcare workers in Rhode Island; bakery workers in Maine; airline pilots, secretaries and police officers. Name the occupation and chances are we represent those workers somewhere.  Teamsters stand ready to organize workers who want to bargain collectively. Once a contract is negotiated and signed, the Union works to enforce it—holding management’s feet to the fire and invoking contract grievance procedures if management chooses not to. Wages and benefits under Teamster contracts are markedly better than those of non-union employees in similar jobs. Teamster contracts are the guarantors of decent wages, fair promotion, health coverage, job security, paid time-off and retirement income. The Teamsters Union also performs vital tasks in such areas as pension management, safety & health, community outreach, governmental affairs and communications. For more than a century, the Teamsters have been a public voice for the rights and aspirations of working men and women and a key player in securing them.","Other, Social Impact",,,251-500,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Our technology provides instant event status delivery and event ownership updates throughout the whole network along with distributed levels of access to functional system modules without cluttering the bandwidth between the nodes. Instead of storing the data directly in the blockchain, Tectum stores hashes that are mapped back to the original data stored at a lower level. This isolates the heavy transaction-related data from the main pipeline by hashing, encrypting and signing the bundles at the end of every transaction and archiving it. This makes the event-related data instantly verifiable and publicly accessible, with different levels of accessibility provided to different transaction-related modules. The event hashing process is run on top of a database in order to enable faster retrieval of data items, and works as an upper functional layer to keep the main-net pipeline free from heavy data processing. The mechanism of isolating the system event formalization process from big-data leading to the main-net unprecedented throughput capabilities is our value proposition. Normally, the rule of thumb for a blockchain is that the greater the security, the slower it is. Conversely, if you want a fast blockchain, you’re going to have security issues, because everything comes with a cost. That’s not the case for Tectum, however, because we’ve separated the levels of data into multiple tiers.","Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Financial Services, Information Technology, Other, Software",1,Gumar Kadyrov,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
