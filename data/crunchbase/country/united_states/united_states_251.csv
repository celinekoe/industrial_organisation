When Lynx Professional Grills was started in 1996, the company was committed to elevating outdoor cooking to new levels. At that time, outdoor cooking meant barbecue grills. But within a few years, the trend for outdoor living took off with Lynx perfectly positioned to capitalize on the demand for luxury outdoor kitchens. The creation of Lynx Professional Grills was the vision of a group of people who, for more than 30 years, had been manufacturing stainless steel products for the commercial restaurant industry under the brand BECA. These products were engineered to stand up to heavy use and the test of time, the same ""design elements"" needed for outdoor kitchen products, which must endure extreme weather conditions. The founders of Lynx Professional Grills were committed to incorporating the same high standards used for commercial restaurant kitchen products — quality materials, fine craftsmanship and innovation — into the company's collection of luxury outdoor kitchen products and accessories for the consumer. When Lynx products were introduced, the company sold the Lynx Professional Grill (free standing and built-in models), access door, side burners and a cocktail station, which were built exclusively for outdoor use. Made of stainless steel, the eye-catching grill set the standard for form and function, delivering such a great cooking experience that it soon became known as the ""world's greatest grill."" Consumers loved that it was easy to clean, too. Because it's manufactured using a special welding technique, the grill has no gaps or seams where moisture and grease can collect. The Lynx family of products soon expanded when the outdoor living trend emerged. To help consumers create the luxurious outdoor kitchen of their dreams, Lynx introduced a line of additional products built for durability and performance — and all with the company's trademark sleek stainless steel look.","Clothing and Apparel, Commerce and Shopping, Community and Lifestyle, Consumer Goods, Design, Food and Beverage, Manufacturing, Sports",,,51-100,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

These fixed rates make it simple for people to make their homes greener and avoid nonrenewable sources of power. Currently, Verde Energy is available to customers in New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Illinois.  More than 250,000 business and residential customers have made the switch to Verde Energy over time and now enjoy renewable energy sourced from hydro, solar, and wind power. These sources of clean power do not produce the air and water pollution generated by fossil fuels. These pollutants have been linked to heart, lung, and neurological diseases, as well as cancer. Supporting renewable energy also bolsters the energy independence of the United States. Verde Energy actively purchases RECs, or Renewable Energy Certificates, to support green energy generation. These RECs provide incremental funding on top of payment for power added to the grid. With RECs, companies can fund green energy development and expand their operations to provide even more renewable power.  Getting started with Verde Energy is easy. People who live within the company’s service areas can take advantage of renewable power directly through their current utility company. Verde Energy customers continue to receive energy bills from their utility company, but the power supplied to their home or business comes from Verde Energy. The utility company also continues to service the customer’s meter and handle any repairs. Making the switch is simple. There is no interruption of service. To sign up, people can visit VerdeEnergy.com and enter some basic information from their monthly utility bill. Then, as soon as the utility company accepts the enrollment, service from Verde Energy begins. Becoming a customer comes with many benefits, including access to free online tools for reducing your power consumption and tips on energy efficiency. Verde Energy also offers rebates and rewards programs for referring a friend to renewable power.",Energy,1,Thomas FitzGerald,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
