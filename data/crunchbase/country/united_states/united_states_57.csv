The mission of the Company is to fully exploit the commercial applications of a new medical discovery by Dr. James D. Thacker, PhD. The role of inflammation in health and disease has been debated since the middle of the 19th century.  The focus of their research at TherimuneX™ stands upon the seminal work of the late Prof. Jurg Tschopp and the discovery of the inflammasome signaling platform.  They have extended this work and related inflammasome signaling to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, the unfolded protein response (UPR), and the genesis and progression of chronic diseases. They have also shown that Naclynamide effectively resolves the excess collagen production in cells from Scleroderma patients and reverts these cells from their diseased phenotype (myofibrolasts) to the normal phenotype (fibroblasts).  They expect to file their IND within the next 12 months for the use of Naclynamide™ in the treatment of diffuse Scleroderma.  They plan to follow with the use of Naclynamide™ in related diseases. Standing upon their discoveries, they have developed a new drug candidate, Naclynamide, that they have already shown to be safe and effective in two different cancers in dogs that were resistant to conventional chemotherapy.  Canine cancer is widely regarded to be the same disease as human cancer.  They believe that this is related to a shared microbiome that has developed from co-evolution of dogs and man.  Moreover, they believe that chronic/persistent/latent infection accounts for several types of cancer as well as the prevalence/incidence of many cancers.  They are planning to follow lead indication with an indication for the treatment of selected cancers. They have established the proof of principle for Naclynamide™ use as a pre-exposure and post-exposure drug candidate in animal models of a lethal Gram negative bacterial infection and a drug resistant MRSA infection. Their published research has clearly established the enhanced innate immune response and recruitment and activation of immune cells and a potent opsono-phagocytic and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response as the mode of action for Naclynamide™ (Adamson, et al. Cancer Biology & Therapy 2014, 15(4), 1-11). Their molecular biology studies have shown the intracellular protein target of Naclynamide™ to be XBP1 and they have elucidated the down-stream signaling pathway through NLRP3 inflammasome activation and innate and adaptive immune gene up-regulation. Their collaborator, Brian Balin, as well as investigators from other institutions, have been promoting the idea that chronic/persistent/latent infection may lead to Alzheimer’s Disease.  They have shown that Naclynamide™ effectively eliminates obligate intracellular pathogens and may be effective as a treatment.   Because Naclynamide™ has potent anti-fibrotic activity, they are presently evaluating its efficacy in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  Preliminary results indicate a similar efficacy in this disease.  Therefore, they intend to seek approval for use of Naclynamide™ in this disease as well. Their advisory board is led by  Dr. Phil Gerbino.  Dr. Gerbino is a Fellow of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia; the American Pharmacists Association (APhA), Academy of Pharmacy Practice and Management; and the American Society of Consultant Pharmacists (ASCP). He received the 2010 Frank Baldino Jr., CEO of the Year Award from Pennsylvania Bio was recognized in PharmaVoice, 2005, Top 100 as a “Change Agent”.

This unique foam contains polyols made from renewable resources instead of petroleum. This microcellular, non-toxic, open cell elastomeric foam is a unique element of the systems that are exclusive to Pura Naturals. Pura Naturals has established a business relationship with Advanced Innovative Recovery Technology, Inc.(AIRTech). AIRTech was conceived in response to the British Petroleum (BP) oil spill that occurred in the Gulf of Mexico in April of 2010. The oil absorbing properties of the non-toxic, elastic foam seemed like a natural solution to the problem. The urgency of the situation in the Gulf, and the realization that these, and other types of spills happen every year all over the world, made it clear there was a tremendous opportunity presenting itself. With the help of a team of engineers, the group created a unique system utilizing the foam to clean up oil slicks in open water. Once the oil is absorbed, AIRTech’s proprietary oil extraction device removes the oil from the sponges so that it can be reclaimed and disposed of properly, while the sponges can be reused indefinitely. Pura Naturals has created a full line up of personal use and kitchen sponges made from BeBetter Foam that is:  Oleophilic and Hydrophobic which means it loves oil, grease and grime but doesn’t like water.  It won’t attract bacteria, Long-lasting, fresh smell, Cleans deep and lifts out the oil and grease from your skin or pots and pans.  Contains Plant-Based or renewable resources: Non-toxic, Won't Harm the Environment; Carbon-negative footprint. Special pre-polymer construction: Super durable.
