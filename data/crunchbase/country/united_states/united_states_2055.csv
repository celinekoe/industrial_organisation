In practice, these questions were answered with even more hard work. In order to remain faithful to our mission and vision, we have had to do our share of research, not only to know how a cleaning company works, but mainly, to understand our customers’ needs. At first, we were very surprised when we came across some really interesting statistics: only three out of five people would trust their homes to a professional cleaning company. It was digging deeper into this matter that we found out just how to reverse this lack of trust and it was then that we were able to gain a fresh perspective on the business as a whole. People need to trust that their homes will be cleaned professionally, but above all, that the company they are hiring will provide the same quality service every time they are called.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
