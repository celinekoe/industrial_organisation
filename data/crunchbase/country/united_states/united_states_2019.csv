Most people donât know that the Greeks and Romans, who are still regarded as Fathers of Modern Thought, actually went to Africa to study. In Ancient Kemet, one degree was awarded: Philosophy. In Africa and subsequently in Europe, this subject included all other subjects such as theology, law, math and medicine, hence the Ph.D or Doctor of Philosophy. The Greek meaning of Philosophy is âLove of Wisdom.â The Kemet Institute seeks to model its educational model after this idea of thought by focusing on knowledge of self, financial literacy and real world application of modern day education.",Education,1,Rashaun Williams,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
