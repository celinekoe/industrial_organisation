Which can be found at www.StockMood.com StockMood.com uses analyze news stories, classify their sentiment, and then measure their potential impact on a stock's price direction. Each article is individually ingested, and its sentiment assessed by natural language processing models. While the models aren't perfect, users can correct the sentiment rating produced by the system.  This crowd-sourcing technology allows the AI engine to constantly improve its accuracy. Mood measures how a stockâ€™s price responds to news. When a stock is in a good Mood that means the stock price responds very favorably to good news, and has a tendency to shrug off the bad news. The opposite is true for bad Mood. The more this happens the stronger the mood in that direction gets. When both the mood and the sentiment values for a stock reach certain empirically determined thresholds, a Sentiment Alert is issued, indicating a statistical probability for movement over the next 5 days. Sentiment alerts can be positive or negative. These Alerts  suggest that a stock may be at a peak of optimism or a peak of pessimism, respectively.  Our statistical analyses have shown that, at the time of an Overoptimism or Overpessimism Alert,  trading in the opposite direction of the news can provide significant edge.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Content and Publishing, Data and Analytics, Financial Services, Media and Entertainment, Science and Engineering, Software",2,"Ben Goertzel, Brett Markinson",1-10,1,Seed,150000,USD,150000,150000,USD,150000,"Lagovent Ventures Group, LLC, Matt Coffin",,2,,Private,,,,,,

Soda has been vilified, many believe rightfully so, as one of the greatest threats to public health. Why is soda so much worse than other culprits? Because it’s so popular, people love it, and they have been conditioned to drink it regularly for over a century now. The problem is, all current varieties of traditional soda, be them regular or diet, are fraught with health concerns. The idea for a healthy soda came about when our founder’s sister, a teacher, saw traditional sodas being taken out of schools. They were exchanged with other beverages that were still full of sugar and had just as many, if not more, calories than the soda they replaced. Someone needed to come up with a better alternative. We knew the big soda guys would never bring to market something that competed directly with their core business, so it was up to us to make a truly healthy soda. Making a great tasting healthy soda wasn't easy. We had to completely invent a new proprietary sweetening system, incorporate functional benefits that speak to the needs of today, and do everything to the highest standards to meet the requirements for USDA Organic and Kosher certification. We are very proud of our product, answering a need that is woefully unmet in the marketplace. So we think we have a great product, but how can we know for sure? We thought, let’s get some public reaction by going on that show Shark Tank and see what everyone else thinks. Well, we did that and in addition to getting a $50k seed investment from Shark Barbara Corcoran, we were also able to gain valuable feedback from real world consumers/retailers with an overwhelming positive reaction and demand for product. Help us make the healthy soda revolution a reality for everyone and the more money we raise, the bigger difference we can make!","Food and Beverage, Health Care",,,1-10,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

After being vetted and pre qualified, they will simply be notified by participating food purveyors (restaurants, arenas, grocery stores, etc.) of the availability of excess food at the food purveyors’ locations nearby. They (and the food purveyor) will be given a code and pick the food up within a stated period of time.  The result is a two way “Win” for all involved. First and foremost, the hungry get fed quality excess food. Second, the food purveyors will see a significant reduction in the enormous cost of the disposal of food waste, as well as gaining a tax write-off for the donation of this excess food to a qualified 501 (c)(3) charity.","Commerce and Shopping, Food and Beverage",4,"Andras Hoffmann, Antalne Ling, Gary Landsman, Szabolcs Toth",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
