The Company's primary focus is on cash flow, with a priority to return meaningful dividends back to the owners of the Company, its shareholders. The Company's ""Oaxaca Mining Unit"" consists of 100% interest in 6 potential high-grade gold and silver properties in the southern state of Oaxaca, Mexico. GORO successfully declared commercial production July 1, 2010 from a shallow, high-grade open pit at its El Aguila project, which enabled the Company to reach production and cash flow in the shortest amount of time with one of the tightest capital structures for a producer.  In March of 2011, GORO announced production from its polymetallic La Arista vein system. The Arista deposit has high-grade gold and silver as well as the base metals of copper, lead and zinc.  The Arista deposit remains open on both strike and at depth.  The Company targets the extensions of this deposit and is exploring for additional deposits at its Oaxaca Mining Unit to add to its production profile. The Company’s growth profile targets production of its gold and silver mineralization as precious metal gold equivalent, while using industry standard base metal by-product credits of copper, lead and zinc to position GORO among the low-cost producers. GORO is proud to have declared its initial $0.03 per/share per month cash dividend July 31, 2010, just 30 days after declaring commercial production. The Company has distributed consecutive monthly dividends since commercial production totaling over $81 million as of May, 2013.  The Company targets long-term dividend distributions of approximately 1/3 of its Cash Flow from Mine Site Operations (CFMSO).  In 2011 the Company returned 30% CFMSO and in 2012 it returned 39% CFMSO to shareholders. Mexico is one of the leading venues for mineral potential and has a 500 year history of mining. GORO has secured a sizeable and dominant land position along a geologically important ""North 70 West"" structural corridor in Oaxaca. The Company is building an exciting geologic model around this corridor with numerous epithermal exploration targets including open pits and veins with skarn and/or porphery potential.","Manufacturing, Natural Resources",2,"David C.

If you are looking to improve your bathroom or kitchen in NYC, then you have come to the right place. Our team of professionals makes sure that everything is in tip top condition, from your counters and shower to sinks and tiles. A beautiful Brooklyn bathroom is more comfortable to be in – and anyone who pays attention to remodeling work knows that the kitchen and bathroom are two major selling points in any home. Of course, the bathtub is a focal point of your bathroom. Therefore, it is important that it looks good. It stands out, after all. Our team is here to help if you need bathtub refinishing in Brooklyn, Queens, Long Island, the Bronx, Manhattan or elsewhere in NYC. Innovative bathroom reglazing and refinishing in NYC is what we provide to our valued customers. We want to make sure that this part of your property is visually-appealing, because we know this makes it more attractive for you, but also for potential buyers. Whether you need tub reglazing in Queens or tile refinishing in Brooklyn, we are here to help. It takes more than just the right materials and solutions to improve your tub and tile. You also need a team of experts who have the skillset and this is precisely what you will get with us. Here is what we do: •	We take advantage of a solution that etches the surface and allows for permanent bonding, while other companies 	might fail to take advantage of a primer at all and merely use wipe-on bonding. •	We take advantage of a high build marine epoxy primer. •	We use a proven topcoat that gives you the finish you desire. •	When you hire us to refinish countertops, we clean the surface and then fix any cracks. We use coating that is bonded 	permanently to your countertops and it is backed by our warranty. •	Basically, whether you hire us to reglaze a tub or to refinish countertops in NYC, you will find that we go through a 	detailed 	process that involves much more than simply spraying on paint! Likewise, it also saves you from having to buy new 	fixtures altogether. ",Real Estate,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Now a licensed driver himself, Brian works on strategy and merchandising for the product he so desperately needed when he was a young boy.","Commerce and Shopping, Manufacturing, Transportation",1,Andy Musliner,1-10,1,Early Stage Venture,,USD,,,USD,,Shurtape Technologies,1,1,,Private,,,,,,
