We are proudly renting dumpsters in all these Metropolitan Areas. We Got Dumpsters began a few years ago when founders David Klein was approached by longtime friend Michael Passas about separating his current company of almost 20 years into 2 separate businesses. David’s current business is All Star Waste & Disposal… A successful waste management company serving the Baltimore & Washington DC Metropolitan Areas. By taking the Dumpster Rental business away from All Star Waste & Disposal a new company was born. Henceforth a new business was formed from an idea... It is called We Got Dumpster.",,2,"David Klein, Michael Passas",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
