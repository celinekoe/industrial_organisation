Targeted disease immunomodulation involves tuning the immune system exclusively at the site of disease in the body, with minimal impact on the rest of the immune system. This long sought-after approach has potential to treat a range of chronic and acute inflammatory disorders including ones that would otherwise be difficult to treat. Alivio has exclusive rights to a proprietary inflammation-targeting technology, based on the research of Dr. Karp (BWH/HMS) and Dr. Robert Langer (MIT), which is the first technology to reproducibly show the ability to target immunomodulatory compounds to inflamed tissue, which can lead to dramatic improvements in treatment efficacy with major reductions in systemic effects. The platform has been validated in multiple labs and preclinical models of inflammation, including models where the inflammation occurred in different parts of the body (e.g., the GI system, the bladder, joints, skin, etc.). The technology could potentially be used with a variety of medications (e.g., small molecules, biologics, and nucleic acids) both independently or in combination, and is designed to be administered orally or via other routes. With this platform, Alivio aims to address the dozens of conditions where inflammation is a central part of the underlying disease pathology, but where targeted and effective treatment options are lacking.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",1,Jeff Karp,11-50,1,,,,,3300000,USD,3300000,U.S. Department of Defense,1,1,,Private,,,,,,

Teaching coursework on entrepreneurship and accounting to up-and-coming business professionals, Rob was challenged by a student who wondered whether bulletproof armor could be made lighter and more flexible. After many years of research and over $10 million dollars in funding, the answer is UNEQUAL, a revolutionary composite that promises to reduce the pain and injury associated with impacts. The multilayer product was originally developed for military applications, and was tested under incredibly stringent guidelines issued by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ), the organization that certifies bullet-resistant armor. UNEQUAL’s unique composite material, fortified with DuPont Kevlar® aramid fibers, works by stopping bullets and dispersing the impact energy of projectiles, helping the wearer to remain safe. The shock-blocking technology served to protect the wearer from impact injuries and bullet wounds sustained on the battlefield, and was adopted by soldiers, law enforcement personnel, and government agents. The technology behind these innovative products is backed by over 85 U.S. and international patents and extensive testing from independent, accredited laboratories the world over. OEM facilities and university science programs have verified the effectiveness of the shock-absorbing protective gear. The product was soon applied to the task of protecting those involved in professional sports. It first found favor in pro sports among NFL players, who flocked to the company’s protective wear. Now, the protective products can be found in body armor and helmet padding among dozens of players in the football league, and other sports governing bodies like the NHL and Major League Baseball have begun to use the products to help protect players. For action sports like the X Games, the lightweight protective products are ideal in that they protect against injuries while remaining flexible and easy to wear, even in extreme conditions. The protective head and body gear is vastly superior to other protective products on the market, especially those constructed of plastic and foam. The layered composite material in UNEQUAL’s protective product line is tough and resilient, able to withstand the abuse that collision and action sports can create. Collegiate and youth athletes in disciplines like baseball, lacrosse, soccer, hockey, and football can benefit from the protection UNEQUAL’s products provide. Products are designed to be affordable and can be customized for specific sporting applications and body types, giving the athlete tremendous flexibility while warding off the injuries and pain associated with sports impacts. UNEQUAL and its products have received several prominent awards for innovation in the field of protective sportswear. The company was recognized by Forbes as one of the magazine’s 100 Most Promising Companies. Thanks to our work with DuPont, the manufacturing company presented UNEQUAL with its Kevlar® Innovation Award in 2012. In 2013, Esquire, ESPN, and Inc. Magazine all listed the company and its products among the most important tech innovations for the year. The industry publication Composites Manufacturing called the company “The Industry’s Best” that same year, showcasing the protective gear’s growth from military origins to sporting applications and its future in protecting actors in movie and television productions, among many other roles.","Commerce and Shopping, Health Care, Manufacturing, Sports",1,Rob Vito,251-500,2,Early Stage Venture,4230000,USD,4230000,4230000,USD,4230000,iNetworks,,1,,Private,,,,,,
