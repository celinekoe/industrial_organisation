GDI acquired a series of software companies in 1998 that had solutions for tow companies. These software companies were combined and called eTrak. With GDI’s software development experience, the acquired tow industry experience and Sheriff Brad Gates’ 40 years of law enforcement experience, eTrak began to formulate a vision for a towing and impounding product for law enforcement agencies. A first generation product was launched at San Diego Police Department in January of 1997. Based on this success, a second-generation web-based product was designed and completed for law enforcement agencies to provide them with real-time information to dispatch, track, bill, report and manage towing activities.","Data and Analytics, Internet Services, Navigation and Mapping, Other, Professional Services",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,Tech Coast Angels,,1,,Private,,,,,,
