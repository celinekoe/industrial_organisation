Visual Graphics Artist Kevin Burg began experimenting with the .gif format in this style in 2009 but it wasn't until he partnered with photographer Jamie Beck to cover NYFW that Cinemagraphs were born. Marrying original content photography with the desire to communicate more to the viewer birthed the cinemagraph process. Starting in-camera, the artists take a traditional photograph and combine a living moment into the image through the isolated animation of multiple frames. To quote supermodel Coco Rocha ""it's more than a photo but not quite a video"". Beck and Burg named the process ""Cinemagraphs"" for their cinematic quality while maintaining at its soul the principles of traditional photography. Launched virally through social media platforms Twitter and Tumblr, both the style of imagery and terminology has become a class of its own. The creative duo are looking forward to exploring future display technologies for gallery settings as well as pushing this new art form and communication process as the best way to capture a moment in time or create a true living portrait in our digital age while embracing our need to communicate visually and share instantly.

Palm Springs Life Extension Institute,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/palm-springs-life-extension-institute,"Cosmetic Surgery, Health Care","Palm Springs, California, United States",Palm Springs Life Extension Institute is engaged in the production of anti-aging and bio-identical hormones.,"2,751,445","Greater Los Angeles Area, Inland Empire, West Coast",$1M to $10M,Active,1994-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,http://www.totalhormonegenetherapy.com,"Dr. Edmund Chein, M.D., founded the Palm Springs Life Extension Institute in 1994. At the Institute, he has revolutionized expectations about aging. Dr. Chein was trained in Rehabilitation Medicine at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles County Medical Center. Reviewing his credentials beyond medical education, it is little wonder that Dr. Chein is considered to be one of the United States’ leading experts in longevity and anti-aging medicine. He expanded the scope of the practice of Rehabilitation Medicine by including the treatment of aging as a disease to be rehabilitated. He has pioneered bio-identical hormone therapies and holds three U.S. patents for medical inventions. Also, he was the first doctor in the United States to clinically use growth hormone on adults in private practice, and the first to support bio-identical hormone balancing as a way to combat aging. He successfully won the legal opinion from a Superior Court judge to declare that “biological age can be reversed” and that the practice of administering Human Growth Hormone in the State of California is a science. This landmark case prevents the California Medical Board from disciplining any other physician in the state from using Growth Hormone for anti-aging purposes. Dr. Chein has seen over 10,000 patients and over 200 physicians as patients/trainees at the Institute. Dr. Chein published his early experiences at the Institute in bio-identical hormone therapy in his 1997 book “Age Reversal.” He postulated at the time that hormones are the messengers to the telomerase, a RNA molecule that lengthens the telomere in our DNA. Scientific discoveries revealed at that time that the healthy duplication and replacement of cells is dependent on that part of the DNA that shortens over time, called the telomere. Optimal hormone levels in our bodies help the DNA to have healthy and youthful cell division. It was at this Institute that Dr. Chein invented the “high-frequency and low-dose” method of supplementing Growth Hormone. He collaborated with the then Professor and Chairman of the Department of Neurology at the Medical College of Wisconsin to publish the 1,000-human subjects study using Growth Hormones safely to reverse biological age of greater than 10-20 years, as reported by the late Dr. Daniel Rudman of the medical college, but without any of the side effects of Growth Hormone reported by Dr. Rudman. Their work was subsequently published by the peer-reviewed Journal of Advancement in Medicine in the Fall of 1999. From 1999 to 2009, it was from the patients at Palm Springs Life Extension Institute that Dr. Chein discovered hormone optimization can lead to the unclogging of coronary arteries and the reversal or cure of such a neurological disease as Multiple Sclerosis, the other two inventions that won U.S. patents. In 2009, the Nobel Prize in Medicine was award to three scientists who demonstrated that the telomere, the tail portion of our DNA that controls our life spans, was itself controlled by a protein molecule in the nucleus of our cells called telomerase. By this time, scientists across the world had also discovered that bio-identical hormones in our bodies are the messengers that activate the telomerase. All these findings provided evidence and support for Dr. Chein’s work. As a result of the Nobel Prize, several laboratories in the U.S. started to offer biological age testing based on the length of the telomere or the percentage of short telomeres present in our cells. By doing such a test on himself, Dr. Chein surprisingly discovered that his biological age was 27 years younger than his chronological age. By using the same test in checking the biological age of his patients at the Palm Springs Life Extension Institute, he discovered that many of his patients had similar findings. For example, a 57-year-old woman had a biological age of 29, and a 42-year-old man had a biological age of 23.8. This led the Palm Springs Life Extension Institute to offer a $15,000 reward to anyone in the world who can show a bigger difference than 27 years between his/her chronological age and biological age using the same type of test. Prior to this scientific discovery, the words “Life Extension” in “Palm Springs Life Extension Institute” could only be shown by reversal of biological age, and “life extension” was an extrapolation or a logical deduction from reversal of biological age because no one at the Institute, including Dr. Chein, had lived to prove that his or her life was “extended.” Now, with a scientifically documented biological age of 33.9 at a chronological age of 60.4, there is no doubt that such an individual, for example, can live another 46 years to the present United States life expectancy of about 80 (in which case it would be 106!). This information will likely change everything you think you know about old age. The fact that long and healthy lives were not expected in previous generations is no reason that you should not expect them now. This is l",Health Care,,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Input to the unit was a mere 200 watts.  Video JVC tape within one camera with previously taken recordings was completely erased (huge magnetic output indicated by this), and a digital camera was erased and its memory permanently damaged to the extent of 10% (possible radiation release - X-ray or gamma). Since first sessions were just to investigate potentials for plasma containment the apparent fusion reaction was a total surprise.  Physicists, engineers, and funding needed for further follow-up.

HOODYWOOD RECORDS,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/hoodywood-records,"Art, Lifestyle, Music, News, Video","La, California, United States",HOODYWOOD RECORDS is an American record company that works to discover music talent and develops innovative music.,"2,751,544","West Coast, Western US",$1M to $10M,Closed,2002-01-01,year,,,,none,For Profit,http://www.hoodywood.com,"Hoodywood Records is an American record company and a subsidiary of Conglomeride Inc. Conglomeride Entertainment, owned by music producer and businessman, Antheiaus D. Conquest. In 2000, businessman and musician / producer, Antheiaus Conquest, along with business partners, Warren ""Flight"" Benjamin and Johnny ""Pedro"" Williams, launched and co-founded Conglomeride Entertainment. However, soon after its inception the partnership between Conquest and Warren soured due to irreconcilable differences. As a result, a bitter battle between the two ensued over the company and its assets, and the friendship ended on very bad terms. After incorporating and taking ownership of the Conglomeride name, Conquest pushed forward with Williams, and continued to promote the company in the Denver community. The two teamed up with Les Franklin and his organization, The Shaka Franklin Foundation for Youth (a non profit out reach program for at-risk teenagers). The youth program was started out of Franklin's grief after his 16-year-old son, Shaka, committed suicide in October 1990. Conquest and Williams were to initiate and spearhead the music production department of the foundation. Williams who prided himself in being a well-rounded and well-connected business leader and ""all-around man"" in the Denver community played the pivotal role in negotiating this deal. Though he certainly was a friend and associate to many, it was Williams' numerous other business dealings and lack of a central focus that resulted in the break down of this arrangement. In frustration, Franklin would later put two other prospects in charge of the foundation's studio, leaving Conquest, Williams, and Conglomeride to settle for a dilapidated back warehouse. Through their persistence, the duo eventually turned the back warehouse into an impressive recording studio, surpassing the standards and quality of the foundation's main studio. This left Franklin's chosen studio managers very unhappy and envious. As circumstances were heating up between the rivals, tragedy would once again strike for the Franklin family when Franklin's only other child, Jamon, took his own life in 2001, as his younger brother had done ten years earlier. The already tedious relationship between Williams and Franklin would not survive this, and as a result, the company was put into a state of limbo, forcing Conquest and Williams to reorganize and devise a new strategy and look for another base of operations. It was during this time that Conquest decided the best course of action, to bring the company's potential to full fruition, would be to move the enterprise back home to Los Angeles, California. It was during this state of flux that Hoodywood Records was born and launched under the Conglomeride corporate umbrella. Its home would, most fittingly, be in the 90078 zip code, Hollywood, California. Hoodywood Records is Conglomeride Inc.'s flagship music brand, and has grown into a diverse entertainment company with a reputation for discovering premiere musical talent and developing innovative music. In its brief history, Hoodywood has been on the industry's cutting edge, introducing to the world such impact artists as Joneus, Lisa Lyris and Marcio. The label currently maintains an ever-growing staff, with field offices in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Nevada and Denver, Colorado, with another office expected to open in the ""dirty south."" Hoodywood's future Hoodywood Records is attempting to expand and develop through partnerships with key brand name entities. The company is also embracing forefront modern technology in its music delivery via the Internet. Hoodywood management has announced plans to make its entire catalog available for digital download, along with its entire repertoire of music videos available for streaming over the net. As ongoing corporate consolidation transforms the music industry, the biggest beneficiary of the restructuring has been the independent sector. Over the last several years, the independents have consistently surpassed many of the multinationals in market share. Hoodywood Records hopes to secure its place and make its own name in this illustrious group of independents.","Community and Lifestyle, Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio, Video",1,Antheiaus Conquest,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The ensuing path led the Maits to discover financial assets they never even knew their father had. The experience inspired the brothers to form Knowtification, a service that works at a family's request to settle the affairs of a loved one by notifying hundreds of institutions of the event. These institutions include banks, life insurance companies, credit bureaus, brokerage and securities firms as well as 401(k) plan administrators. The result is a way for those closest to the deceased to identify which financial assets are in their loved one's name without fumbling through records. In addition to its main service, Knowtification helps clients with providing a centralized location where friends and family can obtain information related to the funeral and other mourning events. For this very purpose, on the company's website at knowtification.com, Knowtification enables family members to create a free funeral registry and memorial page. Knowtification offers two levels of its main service, a Basic level at $59.95 in which the company contacts over 200 institutions and a Premium level at $89.95 in which Knowtification contacts over 400 institutions.","Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Professional Services, Real Estate",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
