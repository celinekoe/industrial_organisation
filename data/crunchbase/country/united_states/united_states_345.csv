The consignment lot, the established dealer and the back yard wanna-be dealers. RV WheelatorÂ® prides ourselves in our absolute fairness to both the seller and the buyer. The company does our absolute best to see that everyone is treated fairly. Currently there are over 8.9 million RVs in the US and all of these will be re-sold at least once in their life time.

Add to the existing RV market, the 6,000 new retirees everyday, according to statistics, many of whom plan to purchase a Recreational Vehicle within the first year of retirement. Younger families are also on the road enjoying the RV/camping lifestyle, although usually limited to seasonal travel and limited vacation time. The problem many upcoming RV purchasers face is the high cost of new and used RVs. The Company's advertised prices are 10% to 40% less than average retail prices.

We  advertise these aged units on a much larger advertising foot print. RV WheelatorÂ®  can find buyers for all of the dealers problem units with no additional advertising costs or contracts required.
