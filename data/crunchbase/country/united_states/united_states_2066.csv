D² Products provided hundreds of display systems, equipment and services to major airlines and airports, including Delta Air Lines and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. The company changed its name to Infax, Inc. in 1985 to align itself with its key product known as the “Infax” system. In the early 1990s, Infax, Inc. made the strategic decision to phase out manufacturing operations and instead specialize in system design integration, which continues to be a main focus of the company today. Based on feedback from airport clients, Infax entered the judicial market in the mid-1990s with DocketCall®, its flagship solution for courts. Since the initial installation, Infax has installed its judicial solutions in more than 200 different courthouses across North America. In recent years, Infax began incorporating analytics into its solutions to give customers insight into their day-to-day operations. With the ability to analyze data, customers can see where improvements are needed and what they can do to be more efficient.

We are a pure play healthcare marketing company that respects consumers and their privacy.

HealthNetwork never asks consumers for sensitive and or unnecessary information, for example, whether or not an individual has a preexisting condition. Health Insurance Carriers can no longer exclude consumers because of a pre-existing condition, so it is entirely unnecessary for us to ask for this information.  We also do not resell consumers contact information either, we are not a lead generation company.  We simply help consumers find the health insurance plan that is right for them, and provide them with the ability to enroll online, offline or telephonically. With HealthNetwork, the consumer is in control.  The end result is that consumers seem to appreciate our business model and approach.

From its founding, their philosophy has been that all people deserve the dignity of a safe place to call home. Front Steps manages the Austin Resource Center for the Homeless (ARCH) via a contract with the City of Austin. In the early years, they served 50-75 homeless clients a day from a small storefront location in downtown Austin. Today, Front Steps provides day resources to over 600 homeless men and women daily at 7th and Neches and provides emergency overnight shelter to 230 men each night. With support from the City of Austin, Front Steps has transformed the ARCH from a day drop-in center with limited services into a 24/7 social service center providing shelter, showers, basic needs, comprehensive case management / support services, and permanent supportive housing programs.   Nine other homeless service providers are co-located at the ARCH, making many of the area’s homeless resources available under one roof. In addition to shelter services, Front Steps contributes to their community’s goal meeting the permanent supportive housing needs of homeless individuals through the development of three low barrier housing programs.  Through the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, the City of Austin, Travis County and their community partners, Front Steps currently houses 54 individuals in scattered-site apartments.  All three Front Steps programs are based on the ‘Housing First’ model with an integrated harm reduction focus.  Their substance abuse program, Streets of Hope, and the Recuperative Care Program, a respite resource for medically fragile homeless men and women, focus on the health and healthcare needs of Austin’s homeless.  And through the generous in-kind contributions of the community and Front Steps volunteers, homeless men and women have found a resource in Front Steps for blankets, used winter coats, socks, work shoes and an assortment of household goods to launch them forward on their journey away from homelessness.",Real Estate,,,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Private,,,,,,
