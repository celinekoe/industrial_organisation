The company was founded in 1961 to provide sample preparation products for electron microscopy as nano-scale samples were starting to reveal new knowledge. Embedding products were added for histology (the study of tissue) applications soon after, enabling tissue embedment in plastic blocks, in addition to paraffin. Dyes and stains were developed to implement better visualization of the samples. In cooperation with federal agencies, monodisperse polymeric microspheres were developed for diagnostic kit applications. Capabilities for natural product isolation and purification led to the preparation of purified material from crude biomass for the initial clinical trial of Taxol for the National Cancer Institute. Isolation and purification interests have led to superparamagnetic microspheres used for DNA, protein, and peptide discovery tools. Our high-purity monomer and polymer products find many applications in medical devices and are used in a great variety of ways to enhance critical characteristics. Our recent expansion into the Electronics Polymer and Chemicals market expands our position as a manufacturer and supplier of high-purity monomers and polymers. Our particle manufacturing technology has led us to complete our line of precision microparticles useful for measurement in nanotechnology applications.

Recently, this Bank (called RBL Bank) was recognized by the World Economic Forum as a Global Growth Company, 2014. Antilles has an unrealized return of 49% IRR in this investment. Antilles' specialty is in identifying investment opportunities in India that are grossly under-priced (with respect to its value) or because of some structural market issues and invest in these opportunities for a 5-year period. Due to our unique legal structure of investments, Investors can make very high returns (in the range of 30%+ p.a.) and receive these returns tax-free in the USA. Current Investment opportunities include various companies in diverse sectors (e.g. Infrastructure, consumption/ FMCG, E-Commerce/ Technology) that have the potential to generate high returns over the next 3-5 year period. The Principal in Antilles Advisors has very deep business and commercial relationships in India that allow him to discover and invest in these opportunities before the broader market discovers these opportunities. One of the most promising investment opportunities include an Utility firm that is trading at US$ 40 million market cap, when the company has assets worth US$ 2 billion. We strongly believe that there are several such opportunities that are severely under-priced in India and that will provide huge returns to investors in the near future.","Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Payments, Professional Services, Software",1,Atul Chatur,1-10,1,,125000,USD,125000,125000,USD,125000,,,,,Private,,,,,,
