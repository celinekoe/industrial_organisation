(Stock Symbol: MCIG) Company, is a technology company that is harnessing mobile vaporization technology for medical delivery applications. The company  launched its first consumer product: The VitaCig, a $3 nicotine-free device that looks and feels like an electronic cigarette (eCig). Unlike a traditional eCig, the VitaCig delivers a water-vapor of natural flavors, vitamins, and phytonutrients. Initially the VitaCig will be produced in three flavor categories: Relax, Refresh, Energize with plans for additional flavor categories and targeted medical applications in the future.   Thinking Outside The Box The traditional tobacco industry is estimated at nearly $900 Billion a year. Financial analysts from Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup predict that by 2022 Electronic Cigarettes will supplant the traditional tobacco industry and eventually grow into a $1 Trillion industry. A Unique Product at the Right Time The VitaCig is the right product unveiled at the right time. Society is well educated as to the negative effects of traditional smoking yet at the same time genuinely confused as to whether electronic cigarettes as currently marketed represent a true improvement in health or are simply gimmicks disguising the delivery of nicotine. By removing nicotine entirely from the equation and delivering vitamins and nutrients instead, VitaCig is well-positioned to gain both the trust and acceptance of consumers around the world. Strategic Investment VitaCig, Inc. is 49% owned by mCig, Inc. (Stock Symbol: MCIG) a technology company that has a history of disrupting the traditional eCig industry by bringing to market the mCig, a $10 loose-leaf eCig. Simultaneously Disrupting Big Tobacco and Big Pharma VitaCig, Inc. is disrupting both the traditional tobacco industry and the growing electronic cigarette industry by appealing to the existing 1.2 Billion adults globally that smoke cigarettes, providing them with a nicotine and tobacco-free alternative that may assist in harm reduction. Moreover, the company is expanding the target market beyond the 1.2 Billion adults by appealing to non-smokers or occasional smokers with a superior method for the consumption of Vitamins, Nutrients, and other compounds with medicinal efficacy.","Biotechnology, Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Health Care, Science and Engineering",,,51-100,,IPO,,,,,,,,,,,Public,2014-04-21,,,MCIG,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/vitacig-ipo--084e3193,OTCQB
