We believe it is the personal responsibility of each individual human being for their own holistic wellness, peacefulness, and sustainable practices to support their local and global environments. As such, our task at hand is to teach the community necessary self-help skills that reflect this philosophy. We will empower Americans to be more mindful of their individual choices that are affecting themselves and our planet. We have three causes that we will ascribe to through our business practices and programs - an individual, community and global cause: INDIVIDUAL HUMAN POTENTIAL CAUSE: To offer programs and services that teach individuals and families how to access their innate healing abilities by aligning to their personal truths, resolving limiting beliefs, listening to intuition, unconditional self-love, and compassionate loving kindness, thereby creating the necessary mind-body-spirit connections for deeper somatic awareness and inner peacefulness. ONE LOVE COMMUNITY CAUSE: To offer programs and services that teach Permaculture and sustainability skills for healthier practices for humanity and the planet, and to empower the community to be stewards for the Earth and live in peace with all living things. GLOBAL UNITY CAUSE: To become a catalyst for positive societal change through our online humanity coaching, service-learning, and global citizenship programs, to help create the tipping point needed for humanity to transition to a peaceful society.  Beginning in Summer 2020 Phase One of Love Warrior Wellness Cooperative is focusing efforts into developing a warm and welcoming Integrative Wellness Center that offers innovative programs, support and services to those who seek well-being and healing of body, mind and spirit.","Community and Lifestyle, Education, Health Care, Sports",1,Stephanie Bucklin,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

In 2009, he took a leap of faith and launched a digital marketing agency focused specifically on serving small-to-medium-sized businesses.  Why specialize in SMBs? Harrison's family is full of entrepreneurs who are in this category and he was tired of seeing how poorly other marketing agencies were serving them. In 2013, around the time that Amazon was making a major push into more categories, Harrison launched a Magento-based eCommerce marketing platform for SMBs that was designed to help smaller companies scale their product catalogs more effectively to be better prepared to compete with Amazon's product scalability. In 2015, Harrison leveraged his knowledge of this technology to join another specialist digital agency which he helped build from the ground up as the COO. What started as three people working out of a supply closet, grew into one of the most well-respected specialist agencies serving some of the largest retail brands on the planet. By 2018, after building the agency to a place where it could thrive without him, Harrison stepped away to get back to what he loved best, working with SMBs while also working on a project for the local food bank in urban farming. In 2019, Harrison began exploring a new agency model that would allow smaller companies the ability to get an ""agency of record"" service at a price that was affordable. In 2020, this effort was launched and is as you see it today. Our model is based on deploying specialists in each area of service and then deploying a lead strategist to keep the entire team working towards one common vision. This approach allows us to get a full team of specialists working towards one vision, that is seamlessly integrated across all channels.  Our tagline is ""effective, legacy-leaving, digital marketing.""

If a girl was cheated on by her boyfriend, she can vent about it on VentNation. If someone got laid off from his/her job and wants to railroad his/her boss, he/she can come to the site and have at it. Conversely, of course, if a hardcore Bush supporter wants to come to VentNation and vent about how much he thinks Obama is a socialist, he can vent about that as well. We offer everybody the ability to rant about ANYTHING - any significant event they want to release their frustration about. If a user wants to bookmark a site and rant about it, or voice their opinions on a hot news story, VentNation is perfect for that, too.","Apps, Internet Services, Mobile, Platforms, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
