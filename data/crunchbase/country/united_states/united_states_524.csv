The company’s goal is to improve the travel experience for tourists all over the world.  Gydem is a mobile application that matches independent tourists with local inhabitants of a destination city. Our application uses geo-mapping and proximity matching in concurrence with a social rating system in order to provide the most convenient tour services available. Users will have the option to book services with priority given to time sensitivity or quality, giving them exactly what they want, exactly when they want it. Unlike traditional tour guide organizations, anyone will be able to sign up to be a local tour guide with the Gydem Application. Each tour guide will operate independently with no direction coming from the parent company. Decisions for tours will be made on the local’s knowledge, the traveler’s interests, and the availability of events/services at the time of operation. Charging an hourly rate for their service, the tour guides will have travelers pay for the tour through our application. Once we [the application developers] take a percentage of the revenue made from the sale, the remaining sum of money will be delivered to the tour guide as payment for their service. While there has been a dramatic rise in the number of “on-demand, geo-centric” services in a wide variety of neighboring industries, this particular phenomenon has yet to reach main stream status within the travel/hospitality industry. There are a number of applications that try to deliver guided tours within specified locations but very few take advantage of the person-to-person, local-on-tourist environment that can be created with modern technology. By offering distinct and unique tours that provide insider-access to the travel destinations, Gydem sets itself up as a strong player within the travel industry.",Travel and Tourism,2,"Kesean Wilson, Thomas Kukla",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
