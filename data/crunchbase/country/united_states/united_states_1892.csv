Using RAWRIP, artists could also sell their songs through portable stores (widgets) that allow them to earn 100% from sales on websites including MySpace, Facebook, personal websites, and blogs. In addition to pay as you go downloads, fans could stream full-length music for free, create, manage and share concert calendars, photos, reviews, playlists, and explore new music through a proprietary search engine called 'The Rippler’. A patent pending smart search engine using recommendation technology, ‘The Rippler' was developed by RAWRIPs sister company Rockbury Media International. The exploration engine automatically analyzed each track by a number of characteristics that were indexed and cross-referenced with RAWRIPs catalogue of songs. Through this, songs were revealed to fans based on similarities in sound, allowing fans to discover new music, and artists to connect to new fans. Artists could get instantly recommended from more popular acts based on how they sound and acquire new fans, without needing an existing fan-base or statistics.  RAWRIP took the successful elements of other services and mixed in fresh new ones, ensuring that the combination of propositions made RAWRIP a truly unique and needed solution in the market. Based on a multiple-streams revenue model, including advertisement, merchandise, tickets, and value added subscriptions, RAWRIP beta was successfully launched in July 2008 and was focused on launching its mobile solutions and new services including a unique label back-end allowing all labels to control, manage and analyze their artists, statistics and demographic information. In addition, RAWRIP portals were in production for the fast growing markets of China, Russia and India.","Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Every person has a story to tell. And not just one story. Many stories! Stories they don’t want to forget. Stories that they want to tell their children someday. Stories they want to tell without revealing their identity. Stories that they want to share with their friends and family! But social media sites aren’t a good place to post life stories, keeping a journal is a thing of the past and many people don’t want to create their own blog.  So where can people go to fulfill this need? StoryShelter: The Social Space to Share Life’s Stories. StoryShelter is the only place online where you can easily write, share and save true stories from your life and also read compelling life stories from others. Using a Q&A format, StoryShelter asks questions about life, love, friends, family and more. You can also write your own stories if you have something specific in mind you want to share. You can choose to post each story publicly, anonymously, or to a group of your choosing.  StoryShelter is a safe place to store your hopes, insights, and memories – leaving a legacy of not just what you “liked” or who you “followed” – but who you really are, in your own words.  The story filter also makes it easy to read stories about topics that interest you and by people who you want to learn more about.  What do my female friends think is the hardest thing about parenting? How does the average 20 or 60 yr old male answer the same question? No other platform can give you that kind of insight – often when you need it most.  Read. Write.

The cost of college textbooks has doubled the rate of inflation over the past 20 years.  Students spend over $4.9 billion on college textbooks each year with few alternatives to help them save money.  The average yearly cost of textbooks has increased from $898 in 2005 to over $1,000 in 2006.  Every year television reports and newspaper columns have stories about the rising prices of textbooks and the lack of options available for the students, but there still has been very little progress in this industry. Textbook Revolt began addressing the problem of high priced textbooks by experimenting with a completely free college textbook exchange named Socialbib.  The site has received many accolades from students who were previously dissatisfied with the options available to them.  As a result, students from over 1,300 schools nationwide joined Socialbib and posted over $1,000,000 in college textbooks. Research proves that although online retailers such as Ebay and Amazon have added competition they have not significantly changed the landscape of the textbook industry.  Demand is rapidly increasing as the overall cost of education continues to rise.  It is evident that this problem will continue to exist as long as students are not presented with compelling alternatives.  The knowledge gained though Socialbib gives Textbook Revolt a competitive advantage to be the first service of its kind to market.  The demand from students when combined with the business opportunities create a ""perfect storm"" for Textbook Revolt.","Apps, Education, Software",2,"Jaisen Mathai, Kevin Hornschemeier",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
