As a CPA from a large accounting firm, I was brought in to learn the car business from the accounting side. I was an A/P clerk, biller, office manager, controller and CFO. As a controller I was paired up with a GM to run the day to day operations of an auto mall with four franchises. Later as a CFO, the vice president and I ran the day to day operations of nine franchises in Chicago. During these seventeen years, I became involved in buy/sells, advertising, HR, bank relations, factory relations, legal, contracts and selling processes. During this time I would educate and train all department heads on the financial statement and forecasting. Due to the retirement of the dealer, I became the vice-president/GM of a single point Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram store. I was involved with the entire process of opening a new store. From getting factory approval, naming the store, website design and hiring all personnel. The dealer lived 1500 miles from store so I was the operator. While the VP, I learned the used car business by attending auctions and buying and selling vehicles, displaying vehicles on the lot and setting up a photo studio on the premise for high quality pictures. Additionally I spent most mornings on the service drive to improve service writer performance and customer satisfaction. Lastly I implemented a menu system in F&I that improved the dollars per unit by $250 and started a BDC. After about five years as the VP, I took on the largest challenge of my professional career. I moved across country to Las Vegas and became the GM of Towbin Dodge. During my first full year, 2013, I took them to the number one Dodge volume store in the country. The first time Towbin Dodge has accomplished that feat. Additionally in the same year, Towbin Dodge won the Walter P. Chrysler award only given to the top 25 CJDR dealers annually. Not only does it require sales volume, you also need market share, great service department and very high CSI.

Funds from investors will be used to bolster required reserves and serve as """"collateral"""" for the issuance of additional insurance policies. Insurance is a cash-intensive business by nature and as such, there are no plans for the company to have the need to tap into funds that have been invested. CompBlue will """"rent-a captive"""" from an existing highly rated insurance carrier which will provide the coverage and strength necessary to get the product to market - under the name of CompBlue. CompBlue essentially purchases the insurance at wholesale and sells it to the public at retail. CompBlue collects the premiums from its customers, pays the wholesale cost to the carrier, and passes the net revenues from the margin on to its investors. Reserves/Collateral enables CompBlue to write $4.06 in retail policies for every $1.00 in reserves. From the $4.06, $3.00 goes to pay buy the wholesale policy and $1.06 is retained by the LLC for operations and distribution to investors. Within the framework of the wholesale policy, premiums paid for the coverage (wholesale cost of goods) are used to provide (1) income to the carrier, purchase administrative, infrastructure, and claims processing (approx. 25% of premium); plus re-insurance as required by law (approx. 10% of premium); (2) pay any losses from injuries to covered workers (19%-55%); with the remaining funds (10%-46% of premium) (3) being retained by the """"rent-a-captive"""" as additional reserves/collateral for future policies (Retained Captive Earnings). Each policy issued is collateralized once at inception, with the same collateral in force each year the policy is renewed. For example: $25k collateralizes a $100k policy in year one. That same $25k continues to collateralize it year by year. In 10 years that $25k has collateralized $1mm in premium. The high investor returns come from the power of renewing policies.","Financial Services, Lending and Investments",2,"Jay Mahan, Randy Eaton",1-10,1,,720000,USD,720000,720000,USD,720000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

CPF raises 100 percent third-party‐owned project finance funds from institutional investors such as Morgan Stanley and Google, working with the investors to structure and launch the funds with managed risk and return profiles. CPF then markets the funds as solar leases and power purchase agreements (PPAs) to qualified solar professionals, including Paramount Solar and Real Goods Solar (Nasdaq: RSOL), through its licensed online solar sales platform, CPF Tools. CPF Tools is software-as-a-service that simplifies complex sales, quoting, proposal and finance processes and minimizes the “soft costs” of selling solar. CPF’s fund investors earn favorable returns on stable investments on the resulting portfolios of residential distributed generation projects. The company’s solar professional partners gain access to solar leases and power purchase agreements (PPAs) that they can brand and sell to homeowners who want the benefits of solar without the cost and hassle of owning and maintaining a system. CPF manages approximately half a billion dollars of capacity on behalf of fund investors, and supports more than 100 solar professional customers who currently use the CPF Market to sell residential solar finance products to homeowners in CA, CO, HI, MA and NJ.

On February 10, 2014, Techne Corporation, R&D Systems parent company, announced that it will be operating under the new trade name, Bio-Techne. The use of Bio-Techne will bring the company’s R&D Systems, BiosPacific, Tocris Biosciences, Boston Biochem and Bionostics products under one common brand name. For more information on Bio-Techne please visit bio-techne.com. R&D Systems, a Minnesota-based biological products company, started by producing hematology controls and calibrators for use in hospitals and clinics. In 1977, we introduced our first product, a platelet-rich-plasma control, and in 1981, we became the second manufacturer in the world to release a whole blood control with platelets. Over the years, R&D Systems Hematology has continued to develop a variety of hematology controls. These products continue to be available through our Clinical Controls Division. In 1985, we released our first research reagent, TGF-beta 1, becoming the first company in the world to produce this cytokine commercially. TGF-beta 1 acts as an extracellular signaling molecule that is produced by many cell types. It is involved in such processes as immune function, cell proliferation, and cell differentiation. Following the launch of this product, we purified several other cytokines from natural sources and released them to the research market. Of great interest to biomedical researchers, cytokines are specialized proteins mediating communication between cells. They have many biological activities including regulating developmental processes and orchestrating the immune response. In addition, unregulated cytokine activity has been linked to many diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and inflammatory disorders. Encouraged by success in the cytokine market, we formed the Growth Factor (now known as Biotechnology) Division in 1985 with the goal of producing and marketing a wide range of human cytokines through genetic engineering. Recombinant DNA technology offers several advantages over extraction of these proteins from natural sources, including lower production cost and potentially unlimited supply. In 1989, the Biotechnology Division began developing monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to cytokines, and in 1990 we developed our first enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Currently, R&D Systems, Tocris Bioscience, and Boston Biochem will serve as the flagship brands in Bio-Techne's life science portfolio. In the coming months a new corporate identity, including new packaging, new literature, new trade show booth, as well as a new unified website will be introduced to customers.","Biotechnology, Consumer Electronics, Data and Analytics, Hardware, Health Care, Science and Engineering",1,Richard Cookson,1001-5000,,,,,,,,,,,,2,Private,,,,,,
