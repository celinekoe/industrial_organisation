After becoming frustrated with the process of posting projects online, interviewing agencies and freelancers, and never knowing if the hired people would work out, we created Digitalogy.co to offer a better solution.  Over the last few years, we have met service providers around the world (both onshore and offshore) and analyzed their portfolio, their programmers, and their previous clients'​ experiences. Based on their skill set, industry focus and pricing schemes, we connect companies with these trusted prescreened software development firms. This transparency lets businesses make a better & faster decision regarding which firm to go with for their respective projects. We are different from other freelancing and tech sourcing marketplaces as: 1. We save your time by not needing to go through 50+ profiles, websites, and portfolios. We shortlist 1–2 agencies for you which are a perfect fit for your needs. 2. The race is not to the bottom because we do not work with unreliable freelancers and rather work only with teams who are lean, cutting edge and have great credentials. 3. We are only working with top 200 odd teams at the moment so your project is always in the safe hands. The teams tend to be more cooperative and fast as we tend to blacklist those who are mediocre in their performances and client satisfaction. 4. Small projects are given to newly enrolled teams to check out their performance rather than big projects. The bottom line is to make outsourcing: Safer, Smarter and Faster. 5.

This synergy between the need for more dynamic, real-time security and a constantly morphing threat landscape compelled us to adapt - calling on our years of experience providing highly scalable security solutions for the ISP market to create iSheriff SaaS.   iSheriff SaaS is the first proprietary, integrated Security as a Service solution for cloud-based Web and email security featuring a common Web management and reporting console.   Our mission is to provide customers with accessible, easy to understand security services that secure their Internet world and enable them to complete their business in safety and privacy â€“ whether their enterprise is large or small.   Our security services utilize sophisticated, patented, real-time content analysis technologies developed and refined over the last 10 years to ensure maximum threat protection. But, our approach to how we deliver this technology and enable clients to access, manage and report on their email and Web usage is simplicity, intuitiveness and clarity.   Our experience has taught us that sophisticated security is one thing, but complex, difficult to manage solutions are inaccessible for many users and this ultimately undermines real security when customers canâ€:tm:t understand it or use it.
