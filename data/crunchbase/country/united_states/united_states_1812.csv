They were selected and flown to Japan to entertain American soldiers during the Korean War. When they arrived, the entire city of Tokyo was shut down by a severe typhoon with violent winds. “Red flag” alerts warned locals to remain indoors, though a few desperate souls scavenged through the debris and wreckage looking for food and shelter. Among these unfortunate souls was a group of children huddled beneath a fallen awning, pressed together for warmth, but still shivering against the freezing wind. The children were barefoot, clothed in rain-soaked rags and weeping. After days trapped in their hotel room, the willful and daring actresses grew restless and decided to sneak out for a midday walk. They did not want to miss all the sights and sounds of this fascinating new culture. Propelled by youthful curiosity, they explored the side streets of Tokyo and strode right into the cowering orphans. Turning onto the side street, giggling as their shoes sank into the mud, the young Hollywood actresses must have looked like angels emerged from the terrifying storm to the children. They immediately ran to the children and cuddled as many as would fit under their billowing coats. Sara and Yvonne furiously flipped through the pages of their English to Japanese dictionaries to converse as best they could. They discovered the little survivors were stranded.","Health Care, Other, Social Impact",,,501-1000,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Grandhi began his business journey as the child of an entrepreneurial family in the South Indian village of Rajam, in the state of Andhra Pradesh. As he grew up, Grandhi was frequently exposed to the ins and outs of running a business, managing finances, and preparing a business for growth. After graduating college, Grandhi started working in finance at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in India. Later, he moved to the U.S. to take a position with SunEdison, a major renewable energy company, and eventually held roles in the financial departments at both Amazon and Starbucks. It was during his time with these major corporations—companies that had both the staff and the resources to implement complex financial and tax-saving strategies—that Grandhi developed the vision of starting his own financial firm. The mission of what would become AG FinTax would be to share the same best industry practices that Fortune 100 companies were using to grow, with small business owners, helping them increase their revenue and profits. In 2019, Grandhi founded the Seattle-headquartered AG FinTax to provide expertise and guidance to entrepreneurs and small businesses on tax planning, CFO services, wealth management, and financial outlooks. Supported by a professional team of CPAs, Chartered Accountants, and CMAs, Grandhi and AG FinTax offer advisory services always guided by the core values of integrity, accountability, and value addition. Since the pandemic began, AG FinTax has worked especially hard to support those businesses suffering from the economic downturn. Grandhi and his team helped many clients get the help they needed through SBA loans and the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans. Now that the PPP funds are exhausted, Grandhi and his team have shifted to helping PPP loan recipients achieve the maximum amount of loan forgiveness possible.","Information Technology, Real Estate, Travel and Tourism",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Established in 2010, five of us decided we wanted more from our careers. We wanted to escape the daily 9-5 grind, and use our creative minds in a more beneficial and interesting way, with a goal of helping men just like us. Over ten years later, Unfinished Man is now a well-known male lifestyle blog, which offers honest and realistic advice for the everyday man. With the site quickly becoming a success, we began welcoming over half a million readers each month. We were able to quit our full-time jobs and work on the content our readers deserved. Unfinished Man has now grown into a website with over 10,000 original articles. All to help readers like you. We now live the dream, running our blog from different corners of the world. With creators and designers living in the US, Australia, and Canada, we work tirelessly to ensure our content covers topics for the regular man across the globe. Whilst we’re not working, you may find us socializing and traveling to some of our favorite cities, like Tokyo and Krakow. Some of us enjoy playing video games, or checking out the latest fast cars and gadgets. Fortunately for you, these passions are transferred into making the Unfinished Man the most informative and successful male lifestyle blog out there. Seen us before? With our ever-growing success, we’ve been featured on sites such as BuzzFeed, Men’s Journal, Boing Boing, Lifewire, The Awesomer, Cracked, and tons more.",Media and Entertainment,,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
