Our journey began with our founder, Jim Richardson, an engineer with a deep appreciation for Microsoft. Leveraging his extensive network from a 20-year enterprise IT career, he launched Finchloom without external funding, sparking our initial organic growth.  In 2016, Brian Levine joined as a partner and angel investor, investing $150k for a 50% stake in the company. His sales acumen and connections catalyzed our growth from 2 employees and $800k annual revenue in 2016 to 9 employees and $3.4M revenue in 2019.  We further strengthened our team by bringing on Nate Jimerson as VP of Services. His leadership enabled us to meet increasing project demands while maintaining above-average service rates.   The Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 led to a surge in demand for cloud and remote work solutions. We capitalized on this trend, expanding our Azure customer base and increasing our margins on our service bill rates while also hiring a VP of Sales to build a new sales team and strategy.   Today, Finchloom boasts 25 full-time employees, 10 full-time contractors, and $10M in annual revenue. We serve 180 customers across the US, primarily commercial accounts with 500-5,000 employees and an existing IT department.

No random receipts, no “I rarely read these” newsletters, and no special offers crowding out the stuff you really care about. Blocking email spies 24/7/365 Many companies track which emails you open, how often you open them, and even where you were when you opened them. It’s a massive invasion of your privacy. HEY blocks these trackers and tells you who’s spying on you. Add private “notes to self” to any email thread Conversations may start in email, but they may continue somewhere else. Some emails turn into lunches or calls or video conferences. Where do you put the notes from those - especially if they relate to the initial email conversation? With HEY, you can add personal, private notes (and files) to any thread. This way you keep everything related to the conversation on one page, even if it didn’t all happen via email. Put receipts in The Paper Trail Receipts, confirmations, and transactional emails getting in your way? With HEY, you can send those types of emails to The Paper Trail where they’ll be out of your way, but easy to find when you need them. A built-in “Reply Later” workflow What if you need to reply, but you don’t have time right now? With HEY, just click the “Reply Later” button to move an email to a dedicated ‘Reply Later’ pile at the bottom of the screen so you don’t lose or forget it. Just set it aside Sometimes you get emails you need to reference later - travel info, handy links, numbers you need, etc. With HEY, you can ‘Set Aside’ any email in a neat little pile for easy access whenever you need it. At hand, but out of your face. You always pay for email “Free” email like other providers isn’t free — you pay by giving up your privacy and valuable personal data. That’s expensive. Since we don’t sell ads, or invade your privacy, we charge $99/year for HEY (though ultra-short premium addresses are extra).",Software,,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

In 2014, RevMedx, Inc. developed the XSTAT® hemorrhage-control device in concert with the US military to stop severe bleeding from non-compressible wounds suffered on the battlefield. They soon realized that this type of traumatic bleeding, which XSTAT has been proven successful in treating, is highly analogous to postpartum hemorrhage. Inspired to address this global issue in women’s health, the team quickly got to work adapting the combat medicine technology for an obstetric application. RevMedx partnered with a team from Oregon Health & Science University, who received a Saving Lives at Birth Grand Challenge grant to conduct early-stage research and development. This work culminated in a pre-clinical proof-of-concept study.  With the inception of Obstetrx, Inc, a pilot clinical trial was performed in Zambia in 2019. Today, Obstetrx is a privately-held company based in Wilsonville, OR.

Powercast,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/powercast,"Communication Hardware, Energy, Energy Efficiency, Hardware, Manufacturing, Renewable Energy, Wireless","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States","Powercast is the pioneer of RF-based wireless power technology, combining FCC-approved transmitters and receivers for over-the-air charging.","155,389","Great Lakes, Northeastern US",$1M to $10M,Active,2003-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,http://www.powercastco.com,"After a 2003 coffee shop meeting near downtown Pittsburgh, a small team set out to develop true wireless power solutions that could both eliminate batteries, and enable completely untethered devices that need no wires or charging surfaces. We knew that if we could deliver long-range, power over distance that could remotely charge enabled devices, it would be a game changer for many industries and products. The team spent several years refining its wireless charging technology – which transmits a radio frequency (RF) whose energy can be ""harvested"" to power devices embedded with a small receiver – and entered the market at CES 2007 where Powercast’s technology won CNET’s Best of CES for Emerging Technology.  Solving real-world wireless charging challenges since 2007: Powercast has since helped customers solve many remote wireless charging challenges, powering their wireless sensor networks, waterproof designs, reusable smart bands, RFID tags and many other commercial and industrial devices, and in 2017 launched solutions designed to power consumer electronics devices. Along the way, the company has accumulated awards and created significant intellectual property (IP) surrounding RF-based wireless power, including 42 patents worldwide (21 in the U.S.) and 29 patents pending.   How Powercast’s patented technology works:  Behaving like Wi-Fi where enabled devices automatically charge when within range of a transmitter, Powercast’s contactless charging technology provides over-the-air power at a distance to multiple devices - no wires, charging mats or direct line of sight needed. A transmitter sends RF energy to Powercast’s Powerharvester® receiver embedded in a device, which converts it to direct current (DC) to directly power that device or recharge its batteries. Operating across a wide RF power (as low as -17 dBm) and frequency (10MHz to 6GHz) range, the Powerharvester receivers are designed to convert RF to DC with up to 80 percent efficiency.  Two long-range transmitters pair with the Powerharvester receivers to serve different markets. Powercast’s 80-foot-range Powercaster® transmitter was FCC- and ISED-approved in 2010 (FCC ID:  YESTX91501, IC #:  8985A-TX91501) for commercial and industrial applications. Powercast’s smaller PowerSpot® transmitter for consumer electronics can be a standalone charger, or be built into other consumer products that then become “PowerSpots” able to charge multiple enabled devices around them. The goal is for consumers to simply place enabled items for recharging within range of a PowerSpot in their home or public places.  Powercast’s continuing mission is to create the most efficient, safe and highest power-harvesting technology achievable while complying with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and other global standards.  The company’s products are available through leading electronics distributors Arrow Electronics and Mouser Electronics.

We believe that formulaic approaches to investing lead to risk averse strategies that stifle innovation and differentiation. We actively avoid restrictive boundaries around ideas, growth opportunities and entrepreneur profiles. To find extraordinary opportunities, we are not bound by a particular stage of investment and do not shy away from contrarian ideas. We believe that great companies take root in unconventional places and that successful entrepreneurs frequently break the mold. The ideas we back come from a variety of sources: an MBA student who is trying to change new media advertising practices; an experienced entrepreneur seeking to commercialize a disruptive biofuels technology; or an executive looking to spin out and develop an abandoned asset developed by a pharmaceutical company.  We are seasoned investors who have backed more than 200 companies through multiple cycles. Identifying interesting opportunities and providing capital is just the beginning. We offer deep-sector expertise in today’s high-growth markets, but we do not let any one area of knowledge guide our overall investment strategy.

Only recently have MIFTI’s scientists been able to overcome the instability problems of Z-pinch.  This problem was solved, because sophisticated software was made available to the MIFTI scientists at the University of California, Irvine by the U.S. Air Force.  Years of experimentation and understanding the science have led MIFTI’s scientists to conclude that the staged Z-pinch fusion approach will change the landscape of electricity production globally by providing a net energy gain from ten to fifty times the energy used to create the process. MIFTI’s technology will have positive worldwide consequences, not only for energy, but will solve the current crisis of worldwide shortages in nuclear medicine, as staged Z-pinch is very flexible and can be applied to a number of earth’s dilemmas.
