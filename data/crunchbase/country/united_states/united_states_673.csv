Airfarewatchdog.com does not offer booking services, but _does_ offer links to such services. The company makes money primarily by selling advertising and through sponsorships from booking sites. George Hobica, a travel expert who had previously run a series of blogs dedicated to finding the best deals for flyers, founded Airfarewatchdog.com. He believed that people could often find better deals on flights than computer algorithms. Airfarewatchdog.comâ€™s analysts have a background in travel and discount trolling. The company received a fair amount of coverage early on for finding â€œfat finger faresâ€, which become available as a result of typos and other mistakes by carriers. Airfarewatchdog.com has evolved from a blog to a more robust interface with multiple features. There is a deal of the day, a list of the 50 best deals, and a blog offering insight into the world of discount flying. The company also offers users a newsletter product, Free Airfare Alerts, which emails deals for user-selected arrival cities, departure cities, or both. It also offers website publishers a fares widget to embed in their site with information from airfarewatchdog.com concerning discount flights to or from a particular area.

With infinite shelf space and zero shipping costs, IODA's full business model entails little more than promotion and digitally transferring its music to retailers.   IODA collects music from Indie labels, digitally encodes it into up to 15 file formats (most with DRM) and then bulk uploads it to retailers' servers.  IODA takes a 10-15% cut of all sales.The promotion side of IODA's business model is headed by Promonet.  Promonet is a database of music that can be accessed by bloggers and podcasters.  It offers sample songs from all of its contracted artists that can be used for free by anyone.  Promonet is the intersection between the long tail of music and the long tail of the web.  It helps expose indie music deep into the online music community.IODA is not venture funded and has grown steadily since 2003.  It has over 2,700 indie labels' licensed music which consists of over 2 million tracks. IODA was acquired by Sony Music in 2009 and merged with The Orchard in 2012.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio",1,Kevin Arnold,51-100,1,M&A,,USD,,,USD,,Sony Music Entertainment,1,1,1,Private,,,,,,

We make sustainable urban+outdoor apparel. All aspects of our business - from the product to the business model - are an extension of who we are and how we live. We design for ourselves, first. If we won't wear it, why should you. The same goes for business: if we can't stand behind the decisions we make, why should you. So, in that sense, we're a little self-absorbed. We're a small team - less than twenty of us, for now. We spend a lot of time together, always talking, testing things out, sketching, pinning things up, asking, heckling, critiquing, revising. It usually gets too loud.   We work hard. We play hard. We like to go outside. A lot of us ride bikes. We also ski, snowboard, climb, surf, run, make music, see music, take pictures, grow food, eat food, stay out late, have families, and have dogs who clack around and sleep at our feet. Collectively, we go through a lot of prosecco, dark chocolate, and beer. And we keep coming back to our Portland office, early in the mornings, until pretty late at night, because we're stuck on an idea: to redesign fashion and to redefine business so that each become a powerful force for change. One small step towards unfucking the world. Our goal has been the same since the beginning-to use design to redefine business so that it can be a positive force for change. We do this the only way we know how: by making sustainability and philanthropy inherent in everything we do, from thoughtful, considered designs to giving back 2% of every sale to one of our Partners for Change. It's an integrated approach which blends the tailored and the technical to craft beautiful, urban and outdoor apparel for the modern, mobile lifestyle. This means classic designs, timeless colors, and premium, eco-friendly fabrics. It means challenging assumptions to design beyond trends to create style that will live long after the season is over. No logos. No fleeting hues. Just simple, clean, well-crafted silhouettes built to move with the elements, but still look sleek in the city. It's a different way of doing things. One that requires a shift in the way an industry does business. One that we're not afraid to stand behind. One that gives a damn-and is doing something about it.","Clothing and Apparel, Design",5,"Chris van Dyke, Eric Reynolds, Ian Yolles, Jil Zilligen, Mark Galbraith",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

This bold objective led to the creation of the Valilly Talent Intelligence platform, derived from an ingenious coupling of talent management solutions with artificial intelligence and machine learning.  Thanks to the major investment in time spent by Valilly software engineers in the development of this proprietary software system, human resource professionals and hiring decision makers now have the ability to quickly find that needle in the haystack hire that they desperately crave. As a result of these efforts, the most noteworthy result that we wish to bring to your attention is the cost savings that utilizing Valilly, rather than traditional recruiters, can provide. But that’s not all that Valilly’s evolutionary Talent Intelligence platform provides and plans to become. With the ambition of a gallant conqueror that has been amassing a force that is second-to-none, Valilly intends to become the dominant force in the HR Tech industry, forever changing the way companies source, recruit, hire, manage, and transition talent. Continuously looking to steamroll through the human resource barriers faced by hiring managers each day, Valilly has the means and drive to push the boundaries of Talent Intelligence innovation to heretofore unrealized new heights.  For all those companies that have been expending large resources to find the talent that they need, to then dishearteningly come away with unsatisfactory returns, Valilly’s Talent Intelligence is the safety net to their needlessly depreciating values. For all those hiring managers that have spent a myriad number of hours seeking that desperately needed employee to turn around their company, tapping into Valilly’s Talent Intelligence allows them to better allocate and manage their own time, as well as the efforts of their subordinates, in securing needed resources. For all those that have been disappointed by the lack of talent management tools offered by the applicant tracking systems and talent software solutions currently on the market, Valilly provides the medicine to cure them of their frustrations. For all those companies drowning in red from HR expenditures, Valilly is here to provide them with the life raft needed to bring them to safe shores.","Administrative Services, Information Technology, Internet Services, Software",,,11-50,1,,,USD,,,USD,,Elevate Innovation Partners,,1,1,Private,,,,,,

You have clearly defined the problem you're addressing and your unique approach to solving it. However, your introduction could be further strengthened by including a few additional details. Here's a refined version: “**Interactive Support for Intelligent Realization of Ideas using AI ** At [isiri.ai](http://isiri.ai/), we are committed to democratizing the power of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) technologies. Our core mission revolves around creating an accessible and interactive platform that enables users from various domains to take advantage of the potent capabilities of GPT technologies, irrespective of their technical prowess. We have identified a key challenge – the complexity of developing effective GPT prompts – which acts as a deterrent for many potential users. To overcome this obstacle, our platform focuses on two main aspects: simplification and collaboration. We simplify the process of creating GPT prompts, making it user-friendly and intuitive. We also foster collaboration between users and prompt developers, encouraging continuous feedback and iterative refinement. This unique combination allows us to ensure the final products are perfectly tailored to the needs of the users. As part of our services, we offer dedicated support to translate industry-specific expertise into practical AI applications. This allows us to facilitate the creation of high-quality, user-oriented GPT tools, contributing to our broader goal of enhancing the reach and impact of AI. Our ultimate aim at [isiri.ai](http://isiri.ai/) is to break down the barriers that prevent individuals and organizations from harnessing the transformative power of GPT technologies. We envision a world where advanced AI tools are not just limited to tech-savvy users, but can be leveraged by everyone to fuel innovation and growth."" For advancing and completing your project, here are some key recommendations: 1. **Customer Feedback:** Constantly solicit user feedback. This will ensure your platform is continuously improving and aligning with the needs of your target audience. 2. **User Interface:** Prioritize the development of a user-friendly interface. The ease of use will be a key factor in attracting and retaining users who aren't tech-savvy. 3. **Partnerships:** Partner with organizations or individuals who are domain experts. Their knowledge can help to build effective GPT prompts and they can serve as evangelists for your platform. 4. **Security and Privacy:** As you'll be handling user data, invest heavily in security infrastructure. Ensuring data privacy will build trust with your users. 5. **Marketing and Education:** Develop a comprehensive marketing strategy that also includes educating potential users about the benefits and possibilities of GPT technologies. This can help drive adoption. 6. **Scale Up:** Initially, you can focus on a niche market to test and refine your offerings. Once you're confident about the product-market fit, you can plan to scale up. 7. **Funding:** Depending on your financial situation, you might need to raise capital to support the development and scaling of your platform. Consider approaching venture capitalists who have a history of investing in AI technology startups. These are just some ideas that could help you in refining your startup and making it more attractive to both users and potential investors.",Information Technology,1,steve yeo,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Part of the savings is passed along to clients, allowing Bizzler to maintain a healthy competitive edge while operating in the $52B advertising market dominated by conventional production methods.  Crowdsourced content has proven to be highly effective and acceptable by national brands, as evidenced by many popular online ads and past Superbowl commercials. They take the same crowdsourcing approach used by a few innovative brands (e.g. Doritos) and apply it to a wide variety of products and services. Their reach to the world internet user base (currently estimated at 2.4B) is driven by Amazon's Cloud technology, their patent-pending website and an expanding focus on social marketing. Their vision is to become the nation's leading supplier of video ads and leverage this capability to expand into related business areas. For example, they plan to launch a new division next year that will specialize in using video ads to promote products/services through social websites. This will provide a means for their existing clients to maximize the value of their Crowdsourced ads and give Bizzler a built-in client base for the new business entity. In addition, the marketing service will be offered as a standalone service to companies looking for a means to promote their offerings via social media, fueling growth of the new marketing division and creating sales connections for the ad generation business. Their website & team are ready to go and they have the networking in place for capturing new business at the executive level from a long list of major brands.
