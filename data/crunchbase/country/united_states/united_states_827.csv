The ecological aquaculture is a framework that mixes the scientific knowledge of aquatic ecosystems experts with the social-ecological knowledge of the coastal communities engaged in aquaculture. This results in economic, environmental, and social benefits from producing seafood in a way that is good for humanity and our oceans. This framework helps businesses produce high-quality seafood, and become more economically stable. It also encourages high-quality research on fisheries, supports innovative solutions driving change in the aquaculture sector, and provides a way for communities to continue applying and deepening their knowledge of local ecosystems.  The model behind Olazul resembles that of an incubator in that it helps develop skills and create economic opportunities for fishermen to ensure the long-term sustainability of their ocean-based livelihoods. The organization runs projects around the world but each targets the most destructive activities and creates alternative production systems through aquaculture. For instance, one project is in the sustainable livelihood development of ornamental fish in Indonesia. Rather than destroying corals with cyanide fishing, coastal communities protect them as a way to grow fish for the aquarium trade. This project will reinforce ecological conservation and provide employment opportunities for both men and women","Other, Social Impact",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Instead of giving you several pages to browse through, Quigal will show only one page of results, and that page will never feature more than 10 different attorneys for you to consider. In this way, one of the trickiest aspects of the whole process (IE, pre-selecting those legal representatives that are effectively a cut above the rest) is taken care of for you.  This specificity is further strengthened by the ability to select the legal area that you are keen on searching from the very beginning - you will be allowed to circumscribe your search to Business, Civil or Criminal Law.  On the other hand, if you are an attorney yourself and you would like to be featured as part of Quigalâ€™s database you can easily do so through the site. Registration is started by filling in a form online, after which you will be contacted individually.
