Our expertise is specifically in managing projects for CAD, RMS, JMS, and Mobile solutions.   As NPSG only consults for public safety software, we put a tremendous amount of effort into the research of the providers, how to best procure, and how to best implement these technologies. Our services are very different than what standard public safety consultants offer, as they also offer many other services. They offer a broad range of services, each taking a tremendous amount of knowledge to be great at, such as Land Mobile Radio, Call Premise Equipment, cybersecurity, staffing analyses, consolidation studies, hazardous mitigations studies, building construction, smart cities, on body and in car video, and much more. We solely put all of our focus on public safety software. NPSG also hires team members who have extensive experience in public safety software projects. Most of our team members worked in public safety, and most of our team members worked at a Tier 1 public safety software company, understanding the details of how companies sell, implement, upgrade, and support their solutions. This gives us great insight when working on your project. As a concierge service, we also assign a Subject Matter Expert (SME) for each part of your project. Each project has a product SME for each product (CAD, RMS, JMS, MDS), but you also get a Needs Assessment expert, a Selection expert, a Procurement expert for contract negotiation, as well as a Project Manager, so each part of your project has an expert guiding you through the process. This concierge service takes a large burden off our customers as they work to implement these large complex solutions. We take the burden off agencies directly relating to workload, as we take a lot of work off our agencies during these projects. But we also take the mental burden off of our agencies by thoroughly educating them each step of the way. Our customers know they are making educated choices, not best guess estimates, during these complex projects. When we say that excellent customer service is important to us, we ensure that we are held to that standard. We do that in two ways. One, we offer a cancel anytime clause in our agreement, so if at any time an agency is not happy with our services, they can cancel their agreement with us. Secondly, our reference list is our customer list. Every agency we work with is listed as a reference regardless of what they might say. We do this confidently, knowing that we have provided excellent customer service to them. Please feel free to contact us with questions or to ask for a demonstration of how we provide our services to agencies like yours.","Government and Military, Other, Professional Services, Software",2,"Buck Mims, Kimberly Mims",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The job of the science fair coordinator at any school is to provide an inspirational learning experience for all students, as well as to host a fun and exciting event for the community.  Our Science Fair manages to help them achieve this without charging them a penny.  With Our Science Fair, the school gets its own customizable science fair website, where the coordinator can publish information about their fair, including the date, time, location, guidance for the students, rules, description of the prizes, etc. The school's science fair website is professionally designed and includes several useful features to save the coordinator time and effort.  It contains a registration page where students can sign up to participate in the fair.  This eliminates the need to send home paper forms with each student, and makes it a lot easier for the coordinator to track the number of participants or send out email announcements to them.  The website contains a page to allow students or parents to order supplies (such as project display boards) for their science projects, which are delivered directly to the students' classrooms.  Also, there is a page to allow students to upload photos of themselves working on their projects.  These photos are then used to produce a fun video slide show which can be shown at the fair. Our Science Fair was conceived and built by Rajeev Goel, a parent volunteer at his daughter's elementary school in Sammamish, WA. Last year, due to his efforts, the science fair was the single most popular event of the school year, with over 90% of the students participating.  He recognized that many parents are now pushing for schools to have a deeper online presence.  Parents prefer to be able to fill out school-related forms online rather than on paper, and pay for their supplies and fees with a credit card rather than having to send in a check with their child. This was the inspiration for developing Our Science Fair, is now being offered for free to any public or private school in the U.S.","Education, Internet Services",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
