The founders' experience in enterprise IT systems had shown them that Internet-based services around the world were being created in completely random, disconnected ways, without any consideration for solid data management, standards and the discipline common to the IT world. Full Partner's mission was then and is today to solve this problem for small business by building its solutions around a Unified Database that brings all the clients information together in a seamless, easy to access cloud-based system. Through hundreds of client engagements, Full Partner has created the most comprehensive, integrated suite of online tools available in the small business market: website and content management, contact management, events registration, marketing automation, learning management system for online courses, affiliate management, member program management, email broadcasting and blogs. Offered through a subscription based Software As A Service (SAAS) model, small businesses can now afford a system that gives them the data management capabilities they normally must give up to take advantage of the latest generations of Internet based business services. Funded in part by this raise, the launch of Full Partner's HTML5, easy drag and drop website builder and email creation system will open it to the market of millions of small businesses and organizations that are currently only addressed by limited versions of these tools from other vendors. Full Partner also provides comprehensive training, website design and best practices consulting to allow its clients to take full advantage of the broad range of features it provides.","Community and Lifestyle, Internet Services, Professional Services, Software",2,"E.

EAAT will ultimately manufacture consumable fish and meat products with minimal waste, without contaminants and without depleting the worlds’ natural resources or destroying its environment. EAAT’S proprietary bioprinting technology is currently the most precise on the market.

Today, there are a few different 3D cell printers commercially available responding to a rising demand for live cell printing, for customizable live cell arrays, tissue bio-fabrication/bioprinting research and other applications. EAAT’s proprietary technology offers the only 3D cell printer on the market with 95% live cell viability, whereas other bioprinters typically print at less than 50% viability. It can also print up to 16 channels at once, providing the ability to print all cell lines, media and other materials at once. EAAT’s ability to control all aspects of production through the vertical integration of its supply chain, coupled with the ability to print cells at a faster rate and with greater viability, and its already established distribution network, provides EAAT with a significant advantage over its potential competitors.","Agriculture and Farming, Biotechnology, Manufacturing, Science and Engineering, Sustainability",2,"Nadia Kemal, Philip Braginsky",1-10,2,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
