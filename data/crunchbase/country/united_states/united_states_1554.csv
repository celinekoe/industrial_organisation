Urine from some porphyria patients may be reddish in color due to the presence of excess porphyrins and related substances in the urine, and the urine may darken after exposure to light. The symptoms and treatment vary significantly from one type of Porphyria to the next. Porphyria symptoms arise mostly from effects on either the nervous system or the skin. Effects on the nervous system occur in the acute porphyrias (AIP, ADP, HCP and VP). Proper diagnosis is often delayed because the symptoms are nonspecific.

Churnless helps them do that. We believe that products should be good enough that people want to stick around and use them.

In the thriving metropolis of Pittsburgh, Jason Cohen's informal real estate investment advising group is doing its part to offer a place for experienced and new real estate professionals in the city to come together as a community and collectively offer investment advice to those who need it. Pittsburgh is a thriving market, with abounding opportunities for commercial and residential development - but like any city, it has its quirks. For those new to the city, a forum like Jason Cohen Pittsburgh serves as a place to network with experienced city-area professionals and receive constructive criticism on their business ventures.  Although he isn't a city native, Jason Cohen Pittsburgh's naming founder, Jason Cohen, has lived and worked in Pittsburgh for over a decade. He is a licensed Associate Broker with the Pennsylvania Real Estate Commission, and has been an active member in Pittsburgh's real estate community. Jason first moved to the area in 2002 after graduating from college with a degree in Finance.  He began his career humbly; he knew that he lacked the funds to invest in large-scale or high-priced projects, so he sunk the resources he did have into cheap fixer-upper projects in high-potential neighborhoods. Jason's initial efforts in Pittsburgh soon paid off, and he began investing the small profits he made into more expensive projects in vibrant upcoming areas. For Jason Cohen, researching upcoming neighborhoods in Pittsburgh was everything. Jason had a knack for discerning which areas would burgeon to profitability over the next few years - a skill which served him well as a real estate investor in the city. Now, Jason Cohen has dozens of reclamation properties scattered throughout Pittsburgh, and has expanded his real estate investment focus from small multifamily buildings to multi-million dollar commercial projects. His residential investments stand profitably in the South Side, Oakland, Mount Lebanon, Shady Side, and Regent Square. Previously, Jason Cohen even worked with organizations such as the Urban Land Institute, the National Multifamily Housing Council, and the Apartment Association of Metropolitan Pittsburgh.  Now, Jason wants to use his successes and experience to aid others in their professional journeys. An entrepreneur and life-long learner at heart, Cohen founded Jason Cohen Pittsburgh in the hopes that real estate professionals in the city could pool their collective knowledge and experience in a supportive forum for the ultimate betterment of all real estate agents living and working within the city.
