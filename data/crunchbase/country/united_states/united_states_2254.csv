It’s a mission impossible thrill ride of advancements that you and your students will love! Your students may feel like they are looking at secret code when they look at the keyboard, but let us give you a friendly hand with our operatives. A student’s life journey may take them to many exotic places, but one thing will hold resolute – typing. Typing skills are essential to a 21st century education. Whether you are using Twitter, Facebook, typing a report, or emailing, a noteworthy part of your day is spent with your fingers dancing on the keyboard. You don’t have to be blogging in Bhutan to appreciate that rapid and accurate keyboarding will save you precious time and deliver your information in a timely manner. Let's say a student can type 20 words per minute and needed to type a five page double-spaced essay on the Central Intelligence Agency. That is around 1600 words they must type which will take them approximately 80 minutes at their current speed. What if they could type 40 wpm? You have now helped them cut their time in half. They have an extra 40 minutes to finish other homework, play sports, or join friends. But let’s face it; learning to type can be arduous at best.
