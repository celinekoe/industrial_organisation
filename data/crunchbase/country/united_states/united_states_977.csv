Our team is comprised of internet entrepreneurs with strong finance and accounting backgrounds that have successfully launched, operated and sold a variety of online businesses; we thoroughly understand that a large portion of an online companyâ€:tm:s value is in less tangible assets such as organic traffic rankings, business models, website infrastructure, financial history, proprietary software code and intellectual property. We are experts in understanding all aspects of online businesses and focus on the most attractive selling points to bring in competitive offers that your internet based company deserves. Selling your online business can be a confusing and complex process that most business owners have little to no experience with. Unlike traditional business brokers, who on average represent 1-2 internet-based companies a year, our brokers deal exclusively with internet-based companies and look at all aspects of the company including valuing less tangible assets that generally account for the majority of an online companyâ€:tm:s value. Our brokers have the industry specific insight needed to successfully market your internet business, negotiate with qualified buyers and bring value to the process unsurpassed by the competition.  When determining the best strategy for making a large acquisition investment, it is crucial that you choose to work with brokers who have experience with internet-based companies and can guide you every step of the way.

I've been a digital marketing expert for over a decade and I started Blog Hands as a result of a simple observation: Blogging is an essential strategy to virtually any digital marketing campaign, yet developing content on a consistent basis is a real chore, and many marketing managers are busy overlooking the many aspects of their campaigns.  During my time managing digital marketing campaigns I found hiring in-house, though typically lead to better content, was very time intensive and hard to scale. When it came to outsourcing, though it was much easier to scale, I was rarely happy with the work that was being delivered. Worst of all the contacts that I was working with had little to no digital marketing background... so they couldn't speak my language. Blog Hands was designed to provide you with the quality of work of an in-house writer at the cost and flexibility of outsourcing. I truly hope you'll give us a try!","Content and Publishing, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Professional Services, Sales and Marketing",1,Chris Hornak,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

They realized that they had a bigger impact together and that the legal industry is unlikely to be “disrupted” at a rapid pace — it is more likely to evolve. The original goal was to encourage greater collaboration among entrepreneurs to move the industry forward together.  At first this meant bringing together legal tech companies, attorneys, in-house counsel, entrepreneurs, and law schools for events centered around product demos, education, and discussion around the future of law. The movement continues to grow and the evolution of law moves faster with every new member of the community.

These plants may be born in a lab, but technically they are created every bit as naturally as what you would get at a farmers' market.","Biotechnology, Data and Analytics, Health Care, Science and Engineering",,,1-10,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,The Paliwoda Group,1,1,,Private,,,,,,
