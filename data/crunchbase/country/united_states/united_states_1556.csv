We specialize in providing Enterprise Application solutions, services and top talent to systems integrators, corporations, government agencies, and excelling in rapid, cost effective solutions. There are converging technological innovations currently taking place. New platforms will spawn significant new software license sales. At B2B, we’ve witnessed moderate migration toward this new platform in 2010-11, but we expect significant future migration to the new innovations. Eventually, there will be a major “technology-spend cycle”. It will be based upon the following innovations:  Business Intelligence: Business Leaders will demand that data be translated into real time information that support Key Performance Indicators and that then helps support better decisions and predict outcomes based upon derived scenarios. BI initiatives are the #1 priority of most CIO’s.   Cloud Computing, Server Virtualization, and Security: This is a significant paradigm shift and companies are implementing enterprise applications “in the cloud” due to the fact that it significantly reduces the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and transitions the support of these applications offsite. Companies may not choose to migrate ERP to the cloud, but CRM, SCM, HCM, BI, Marketing, Talent Management, and many other applications are very well suited to this platform. Mobility Solutions: Old, traditional views of how work is accomplished will be broken and replaced with a much more adaptive, disparate, and mobile workforce.   Usually, Mobility focuses on CRM applications, but can also involve any relevant application that appeals to a global and mobile. Smartphones, iPads, other touch pad devices, and the integration of that data back into the enterprise will motivate companies to upgrade much, if not all, of their technology platforms.   Collaboration Tools: The requirement to connect a disparate and mobile workforce will spawn technologies that connect constituents and allow for more effective team-based collaboration.","Information Technology, Professional Services, Software",,,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

In the fall of 1928 Algur H. Meadows and friends Henry W. Peters and Ralph G. Trippett founded a loan company, the General Finance Company, which later became the General American Finance System in 1930. In the summer of 1936 Meadows, Peters and Trippett united with J. W. Gilliland, a petroleum expert, to unite the companies and form the General American Oil Company. Ralph G. Trippett served as president of the new company, which was headquartered in Dallas, Texas. The company acquired over 170 oil wells, several refineries and the assets of the General American Finance System and its subsidiaries. By 1959 the company had acquired 2,990 oil wells in fifteen states and Canada and was drilling for oil in Spain. Richard Rainwater became a partner in the company in 1969, as did Howard Hughes. In 1971, Peters acquired a minority stake in Howard Hughes' Hughes Tool Company, to which was later sold in 1972. In 1967 the General American Oil Company merged with its affiliate Premier Petrochemical of Pasadena, Texas. After Peters passed away in 1981, Woods would go on to manage the family business and consolidated much of the family’s assets to Texas under Hogshead Spouter Co. In 1983, Phillips Petroleum acquired all of the General American Oil Company's assets, then later acquired by Amoco. Today, Woods Family Investments is the asset manager for Woods Family Office's alternative investments, equities, fixed income, currencies, commodities and structured products.
