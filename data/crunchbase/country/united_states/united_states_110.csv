It is the only Nano-scale, on-site production of LNG in the world.     Birthed in Silicon Valley, AG&T believes liquid natural gas (LNG) is the alternative transition fuel of the future. As long as they continue to use the combustion engine LNG is the simplest hydrocarbon they have and the cleanest fossil fuel in existence. It's non-toxic, it's safe to breath, it does not affect water quality and it’s safe for sea life. If spilled it does not leave a residue, it evaporates quickly, when mixed with air it becomes to lean to burn and simply vaporizes. At current commodity price levels it costs less than 60 cents a gallon. In North America they have over a 100-year supply of natural gas, enough that it would allow us to become completely independent upon foreign oil. The real question maybe, why aren't they using it now?    Zeus Intelligence reports there are only 29 LNG manufacturing plants in the U.S. today and DOE reports only 81 fueling stations. The average plant produces over 100,000 gallons per day. What makes AG&T unique is their ability to manufacture under 2,000 gallons a day. At this """"Nano-scale"""" AG&T liquefiers fall under the higher regulatory burdens of larger plants and by occupying such a small foot print AG&T liquefiers are portable and can easily be placed in a fleet operators parking lot. After tapping into the local utilities natural gas lines, AG&T can be produced LNG on-site for use as an alternative fuel for cars and trucks.    In the battle to fight global warming and climate change, AG&T liquefiers are also a perfect fit for solving the worlds air pollution problems stemming from fugitive gases coming from oil & gas drilling sites as well as public landfills. AG&T liquefiers are modular in design and can be scaled to fit the varying demands often required in remote landfill and drilling site locations.","Energy, Natural Resources, Sustainability",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

We are first to market with a new way of holding and using your mobile devices. As a new company, we believe in creating products that provide simple solutions to challenging ideas. We believe in American ingenuity and support that belief by making our products in the United States. We have worked with Velcro® brand fasteners in designing our product line. You will find our products in retail stores and online. CellHandle™ is our new Patent Pending product that allows you to hold your phone with one finger. Its recent launch has successfully proven that people are looking for new ideas to help handle their phones. A second new product, EZ CellHolder™, will keep your phones or other hand held gear where you want them. Then there is e-Handle™, our new product that provides a comfortable way to hold your e-Reader. This new product line represents the beginning of our quest to provide you with solutions for holding your electronic gear. Scott Paul Technologies is the brainchild of Paul Sklar and Scott Cynamon. An attorney and a recycling company executive by day became inventors out of need. Their first idea, CellHandle, was conceived after surgery required bed rest for Paul. He had to continue running his practice from the phone while lying on his back. After continually dropping the phone when tired, he had the ‘Aha’ moment. He and Scott spent two years developing 127 different versions before settling on the 128th refinement and announcing it ready to go. That led to an expansion of the original idea that now makes up the product line. Paul is a practicing attorney with his own firm specializing in elder law, an inventor, and a patent holder. He studied commercial and industrial design at the Parson’s School of Design in NY before becoming an attorney. He resides in NYC with his wife and two sons. Scott is a 30 year veteran of the textile and recycling industry, an international product trader, and the owner of Cyntex Co. His company was recognized by the 2008 Inc 5000 Survey of the Fastest Growing Companies in the USA and Top 50 Fastest Growing recycling companies. Scott is an ardent athlete, skiing , open water swimming and cycling. He lives in a suburb of NYC with his wife and young twin sons CellHandle™, e-Handle™ and EZ CellHolder™ are trademarks of Scott Paul Technologies.

Sister Betsy's Surf Wax,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sister-betsy-s-surf-wax,Apparel,"Venice, California, United States","Sister Betsy is a surf wax and apparel company founded by James Mosely in 2020, in Venice, California.","2,067,269","Greater Los Angeles Area, West Coast, Western US",,Active,,,,,,,For Profit,https://sisterbetsy.com/,"Sister Betsy was founded by James Moseley, a local surfer in Los Angeles. James is passionate about having a brand and a company that is inclusive, environmentally friendly, and above all, stays true to surf culture. Part of the inspiration behind the Sister Betsy brand name is the song Bam Bam by Sister Nancy. Bam Bam is a well-known reggae anthem. Sister Nancy is known as being the first female dance hall DJ that dominated the dance hall scene for over two decades. Reggae music has always played a role in the counterculture aspect of surf culture, so it makes sense that Bam Bam and Sister Nancy would lend a hand in inspiring the Sister Betsy brand. The meaning behind the word “bam” itself marries nicely with what James is trying to accomplish with the Sister Betsy brand. It can be used as an exclamation or as a way of saying that an individual’s spirit cannot be held within any confines. James himself has chosen to take his own path in life, not sticking to traditional nine to five business roles or the conventional ways of breaking into an industry by factors like unpaid internships. He has chosen instead to create a successful business from scratch and make a name for himself from within the industry. With that business, he is spreading his message of following what you believe in and taking your own path and forging a positive impact in his customers along the way. He is doing an especially impressive job of reaching an audience of younger surfers with this positive message.  Sister Betsy’s surf wax is manufactured in America and is also produced with organic materials during a hand pouring process. James himself will pour batches of the wax as he is committed to ensuring a high-quality product with each and every batch. The hexagonal shape of the wax is not only a unique and aesthetically pleasing design choice, but it makes for a wax that is easy to use. The ease of use is outstanding for both beginners and Pro Surfers, like Nate Yeoman, who helped James test out the wax to find the perfect formulation. Nate Yeoman has been a huge supporter of Sister Betsy Surf Wax and has become a sponsor of the products as well.  James Moseley is currently going to college to get his degree in business and has also founded his successful company concurrently. He is adamant that with Sister Betsy, he stays true to his promise of challenging the status quo. James plans to accomplish this goal by focusing on having a genuine connection with his customers. This genuineness is recognized in the products that Sister Betsy puts forth, the wax is created to last and is easy to use. The prices are very affordable which makes the products accessible to a very wide customer base, and they also appeal to all ages, all skill levels, and genders.",Clothing and Apparel,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

It was before browsers and before the ""computer mouse"" was even available. A lot has changed in technology in twenty years and the owners of ProNeticas have participated in the many levels of the development of many of those technologies and concepts that shape our internet today. ProNeticas was not officially formed until 2009 as a desire to provide better solutions for businesses that need technology. Having assisted dozens of enterprise projects and hundreds of technology firms into successful platforms meant we had lots of experience in servicing business professionals - the new Agency is meant for a new focus. Many of these companies had different levels of resistance to apparent technologies. This had a ""painted corner"" effect and inspired the creation of our ""business-to-professionals"" web services programs and offerings. We are passionate about the internet and websites because of the endless possibilities, everyday is a new day at our company, which means our teams are always fresh on ideas. Technology should be easy to adjust and quick to deploy to meet the fast pace demands that management teams need from rapidly changing markets. Getting these results is hard when you are concentrating on sales, product marketing, logistics, and procurement for your company. Technology services partners like ProNeticas have proven to be valuable connections to today's large businesses. ProNeticas uses technology to save money like with data center consolidation or server consolidation and we push to drive more sales using Enterprise Application Development, CRM Management and Rapid Application Development.
