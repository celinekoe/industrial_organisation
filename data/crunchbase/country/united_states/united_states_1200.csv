Innovatively integrating a high energy field with traditional HEPA filtration, eHEPA® technology successfully overcomes limitations and inefficiencies associated with standard filters. The result is a truly effective air purification process that collects particles of the smallest size, including microorganisms, with high efficiency and at low pressure drop. Furthermore, by applying a high energy field that generates active species that permeate through the filter media, eHEPA® not only captures but also destroys microorganisms at extremely high kill rates, thereby preventing the reproduction of these unwanted microbes on the filter surface which leads to re-contamination of the airflow.",,1,Arya John Zahedi,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
