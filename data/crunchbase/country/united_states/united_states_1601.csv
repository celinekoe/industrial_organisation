We offer a new approach to legal outsourcing, focusing on value and relationships over billable hours and providing our clients with the support they need to protect their interests. Today’s business landscape is as competitive as it is lean. In order to succeed, it is necessary to ensure your operations are viable and your expenses are kept to a minimum. You also need to be protected from every legal standpoint. Unfortunately, staying lean and having unrestricted access to general counsel services do not always go hand-in-hand. It has become our mission to change that. From business transactions to employment issues, entity governance, intellectual property, and legal risk management, we support you with the legal services you need to run your business safely, efficiently, reliably, and affordably. Simply put, we give you the peace of mind you need with the value you desire. Our client base is small, which has allowed us to establish close, meaningful, and highly beneficial relationships. We feel that the better we know you, your business, and your industry, the better we can serve you and we take great care to understand your goals as well as the legal challenges that you regularly face. Our small but efficient team guarantees you of dedicated personal attention through every transaction. In many cases, we are essentially speaking for you, and this is not a responsibility we take lightly. For you, it’s like having a dedicated legal team of your own, but without the major expense of a retainer and its inherently unpredictable hourly costs. Our attorneys and assistants are only a phone call or email away, so you can be confident that your interests are being well represented and all your concerns addressed.","Media and Entertainment, Other, Professional Services",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The company started operations in 2008 recognizing the market need for a cost-effective software platform for the integrated, adaptive, and collaborative management of a broad range of environmental assets such as trees, landscapes, water bodies, and catchments among others. Paper, Excel, email, and GIS based software are the primary tools currently used for managing environmental systems. These tools were never intended for handling the range of issues and challenges posed by environmental assets. Consequently, almost the entire space of environmental asset management has remained highly inefficient and ineffective. The company’s initial efforts led to the development of its innovative Integrated Environmental Asset Management System (iEAMS). iEAMS has been proven through more than 30 projects for customers that include the California Water Quality Control Board, the US Forest Service, arborists, the World Bank, utilities, cities, counties, water districts, farm bureaus, conservancies, and watershed/river groups Tree Asset Manager (TreeAM) evolved from the work done for the US Forest Service implementing their latest generation of models for urban tree growth, biomass, and ecosystem services. Essentially, TreeAM is iEAMS modified for the management of just one environmental asset class – trees and vegetation. Given the company founder’s deep roots in electric power engineering, TreeAM functionality and market focus naturally shifted towards utility vegetation management.","Other, Software",1,Joe Purohit,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

PERSIST combines its proprietary AppStor™ software with hardware from leading storage vendors to create an active-archive appliance that enables companies to handle the explosive content demands that are taxing their current primary architectures. Now large organizations can manage their reference information, including email, document imaging, and digital media—with application-intelligent technology that outperforms any other solution on the market. Data and storage needs are rising at a tremendous rate due to the explosive growth of reference information. In fact, according to analysts’ estimates, some 52 billion emails will be transmitted daily within the worldwide enterprise market by the end of 2006. Additionally, new regulations that require some companies to archive and retain all business communication for a minimum of three years has generated an even greater need for reliable, scalable digital storage. PERSIST AppStor™ Active-Archiving Solutions solve the problem of expanding storage needs with powerful scalability from 1TB to 25TB mirrored, in mirrored increments per system. It automatically offloads and catalogs large amounts of reference information, eliminating the need for additional expenditures to existing solutions. While many companies simply add expensive multi-vendor hardware and software, and hire additional IT personnel to manage it, PERSIST makes it is possible to build and manage a solution designed specifically to reduce complexity while directly addressing the issue of spiraling, out-of-control storage costs.","Information Technology, Software",1,Perry Wu,10001+,1,M&A,1500000,USD,1500000,1500000,USD,1500000,,,,,Private,,,,,,
