OMEBM is a company that is privately held under the collective scope of affiliated companies privately owned and managed by OMEBM LLC. The first brand in its portfolio of brands was launched in 2012. The namesake band for the company offers a variety of premium high quality designer fashion jewelry, accessories, clothing, beauty products, and home accessories. OMEBM delivers a consistent customer experience through it's access to a broad network of vendor relationships and premium E-commerce platform.  OMEBM has offices located in New York, Texas, Utah, and Virginia, the primary headquarters for OMEBM are located in New York, New York. Launched in 2012 - the ever evolving style conscious company operates a diverse portfolio of retail brands; proving it's long term stability in the retail space by firmly rooting it's brands in adaptive e-commerce environments. After previously shuttering the brand to work on new developments and a reformatted user interface, the brand  announced a re-imagined version of the original store concept for the digital platform. Delivering on an established history of consistent results, exclusive first access was granted to retail industry insiders who provided feedback that the new platform was assured to bring significant success. In November 2019, OMEBM reopened it's digital doors to the public and feedback regarding the site redesign and offerings has been ""overwhelmingly positive"" - according to its leadership team responsible for the changes. In 2020 at the beginning of the COVID - 19 pandemic, Senior leadership at OMEBM declined to announce a concrete agenda for post pandemic retail developments. There was much speculation on the future of OMEBM and it's subsidiary brands. Industry analysts questioned if the previous projection for a transition into brick and mortar store fronts would yield true for OMEBM; or if the the parent company would continue to expand on the success of their digital footprint in light of overwhelming adverse conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. OMEBM has been able to successfully manage it's exposure during an unprecedented retail disruption. As a privately held company, no financial data has been officially released. No IPO is slated for OMEBM at this time.  In 2021 the company announced sweeping changes to it's projected growth trajectory. Senior leadership at OMEBM have confirmed that the company will not expand into physical storefronts. Instead, the company plans to revamp its online presence with the launch of several new retail brands under its umbrella. As of 2023, the company has provided no statements on the scope of future business developments.",Commerce and Shopping,1,Noah Bronston,251-500,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
