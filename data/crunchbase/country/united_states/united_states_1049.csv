WEN® brings a completely different approach to the way you cleanse your hair. Chaz Dean, world-renowned hair expert and Creator of WEN, got his start in developing hair care products at a popular Beverly Hills salon, where he worked as an assistant to the manager. With no prior experience in product development, Chaz was asked to help create a deep conditioner for the salon's own product line.  While some would think he was in over his head, Chaz embraced the challenge and about nine months later, launched a product for his first time. He gained the trust and confidence of the company, and just three months later, he was asked to develop a natural product line. All this ... at the age of just 21.  After more than a year of careful testing using both sides of Chaz's own head, the product line was finally launched. It featured a primrose shampoo, rosemary conditioner and sage conditioner. Word spread fast about the concept of cleansing hair without lather, creating a snowball effect among Hollywood celebrities. Since many of them were actors who had to style their hair for shows, they would come into his salon with damaged hair—all eager to learn how to get shinier, more manageable, healthier-looking hair. It's because of Chaz's relentless drive that WEN® has become a worldwide success. Since WEN® was created 16 years ago, it has sold 40 million bottles and is loved by hundreds of thousands of customers worldwide, from Asia, to Latin America, to the Middle East.","Commerce and Shopping, Consumer Goods",1,Chaz Dean,251-500,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The Epic Delta Dampening System was so advanced that, still today every major press manufacturer incorporates a dampening system based on Epic’s technology. Epic is also credited for significant innovations in offset and digital coating technologies. Epic was the first company to retrofit an offset printing press with a coater. Additionally, when Xerox Corporation was looking for a company to develop a coater to run in-line with their iGen presses, they turned to Epic to develop a solution. Epic is now a recognized Xerox Innovation Partner. Epic’s founder and CEO, Harvey Dahlgren is an industry icon. Since Epic’s inception, Harvey has worked closely with Epic employees to develop and commercialize products.

Not only because it’s Friday, that’s just the type of team they are – high energy, excited about their work, and enjoy getting pumped up for the day! The music is up, employees are joking around with each other and everyone is getting ready for one of their favorite days of the week. You see, it’s an office tradition that on every Friday employees have the opportunity to “throw down” with one another. Of course not in a physical sense (that would not be condoned). A “throw down” is simply a challenge, a competition, where two or more people set forth a bet as to who will outperform the other for that day. It’s all in good fun of course but the Summit Consulting employees thrive on fun challenges like this! Part of the Glen Burnie team’s competitive nature comes from the fact that many of them are former athletes. Some even played at a collegiate level in sports such as track and field, soccer, baseball, basketball, wrestling, and hockey! Many others are simply sports fans. Lots of Philadelphia Eagles supporters, but some other teams that are represented at Summit Consulting include, Baltimore Ravens, Baltimore Orioles, Penn State football, Philadelphia Flyers and the Washington Capitals. It’s a diverse group but they all share one thing – the love to compete! And Management doesn’t mind one bit! As long as they are conducting themselves in a professional manner and operating with integrity they are totally on board, even join in from time to time! After all, competition typically improves performances. So what is the outcome from these “throw downs”? Well, it really is whatever is agreed upon between both parties. Usually, it ends up being something like the loser has to bring coffee in for the winner the following morning, or, everyone’s favorite, “biggest fan”. What that means is the loser essentially has to be the winner’s “hype man” for a day. If you’ve never had your own hype man, you’re definitely missing out! And let’s not forget the best part about winning your “throw down”… bragging rights.

This helps publishers leverage the wealth of content within each book, by exposing the topics most likely to lead to a conversion. As different trends emerge, new keywords highlighting different elements of a book will attract the most traffic.

As individuals who excel under extreme conditions, executing tasks with outcomes that are measured in life and freedom, their qualities are invaluable to any organization. The SFF is focused on ensuring that these individuals and their capabilities are not lost in the posterity of duty. From educational scholarships to job placement and networking opportunities, the SFF provides SEALs with countless pathways to success within the communities they fought so hard to protect. The SFF was created in response to the lack of support for continuing education and career development for active and veteran Navy SEALs. High tuitions, limited financial resources and lack of access to professional networks combine to prevent these exceptional individuals from reaching their full potential in civilian life.  The SFF focuses its resources on career development and educational opportunities by partnering with academic institutions, corporations and individuals.  Under this model we are able to support each accepted applicant regardless of his stage of post-military life, whether it is by providing a college scholarship, funding an internship, matching with a professional mentor or providing permanent job placement services. By helping to surmount these initial barriers, we can empower SEALs to excel in the civilian world just as they did in their military careers.

This has been successfully achieved through the Task Force approach over the past 6 years. The Task Force approach is designed to solve common problems in active product development, such as fragmented time and too many calls, resulting in an average decrease from 19h to 7h per week. This approach also addresses the issue of personal responsibility, as larger teams often lead to less individual accountability. With increased focus and smaller independent teams, tasks are completed as planned. Scaling engineering teams can be challenging, but the TF approach allows for easier management during layoffs or the addition of new staff. Each Task Force is independent, reducing morale drops during layoffs and eliminating worries for current staff when new hires are brought in.

Problem The way mathematics is taught is test-oriented and lecture-based. ‘Modern’ educational systems prepare students for the exams, but not for solving real-life problems. They also deprive students of an ability to try their own ways to solve problems before hearing a lecture about them. As a result, many students don’t see how mathematics can help them in the real world, so how can they be interested and passionate about it? Breakthrough Unlike existing systems, SOLVY is not another online textbook. While aligned with the official Common Core curriculum, it allows for multiple ways to solve a problem, and the students can get step-by-step feedback on their solutions – much like from a human teacher. Their teachers, in turn, will get automatic reports on student performance and knowledge gaps without spending nights on tedious grading of homework. Why Does It Matter? Literacy and numeracy are recognized as cornerstones for the future success of our children, and yet many countries, rich and poor, struggle to achieve them. Lack of resources, or recalcitrant legacy teaching systems lead different countries, from the USA and UK to Brazil to failure or mediocrity in mathematics. Without a solution to the innumeracy problem, our kids will not only fail at the university, but will also have real troubles in their financial and professional lives.",Education,,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
