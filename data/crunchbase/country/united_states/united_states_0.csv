As a result, only 16% of lung cancers are found at an early stage and the current 5-year survival rate is < 20%.

Door combines the same principals and culture across residential real estate brokerage, mortgage and title - a team-centric commitment to client service through specialization, full-time non-commissioned experts, and a belief that technology can support and improve the experience and outcomes in home ownership. Our agents and loan officers spend 100% of their time working with clients rather than lead generation. We believe the traditional 100% commission, contractor model does not align with client interests. Our success in delivering the best outcomes in real estate can be independently measured by our Zillow rating of 4.9 out of 5.0.  The Door Difference: Technology as service enabler: We build technology to increase access, transparency and insights for clients in their  real estate journey.  Specialization : The real estate process requires a very wide range of skills, and the only way to manage each component of the process well is to specialize. Door agents & experts specialize in areas like project management,  marketing, lead management, home valuation, transaction coordination and negotiation to ensure each agent is focused on what they do best. This leads to happier agents and much better outcomes for clients. Keep More of their Home Equity : Since our agents focus only on client service (instead of lead generation), they are able to close many more transactions per month than a traditional agent - and with very high client satisfaction scores. That enables Door to charge far less in fees, and for our clients to keep more of their hard-earned equity.
