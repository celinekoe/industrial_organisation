In addition, we create professional social media content to promote and build our clients' brands.  We’re LightShift Video. Welcome to our page! Our company specializes in techy and geeky video creation for technical startups with traction, all the way up to the world’s largest software companies. Our clients trust in us to provide high quality, impactful videos that leave an impression on the viewer and promote their brand. Videographers, video producers, video editors -- they’re a dime a dozen. A video production company with a computer engineering and tech-writing background, specially niched to produce technical content with little to no direction? That’s LightShift Video, and we’re second to none. We like talking about SaaS software, developing demo environments, hosting software on virtual machines, and doing 4K 60fps captures off of our high-end graphics hardware. Take that technical back-end, mix it with creativity and years of video production experience, and you have software demos that are authentic, easy to comprehend, and pleasing to the eye. Let's face it. When starting a business, time is precious. Every task you can outsource to another professional gives you more time you can spend doing the tasks that only you as a founder can really do. As beneficial as video is to your company, spending hours trying to master the industry standard tools we use such as Adobe After Effects, Adobe Premiere Pro, and Adobe Captivate can be a huge learning curve. We’ve heard from many clients who start out looking to do their software tutorials in-house, but discover it’s very time consuming if you don’t do it every day. We live this stuff and when we carry the torch for you, this is one big responsibility you can take off your “to-do” list immediately! Moreover, with extensive experience in Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook video creation (standard 16:9, square 1:1, and ""vertical"" 9:16 video), we know how to make quick, snappy social media videos that get attention. Do you want longer form promotional videos, software tutorials, green screen videos, motion graphics, vertical trade show billboards, and Android/iOS app previews and promos? Yep, we do that too--and with unparalleled quality. We'd love to hear from you! Contact us here on Crunchbase, or simply Follow our page to connect with us.

Developed by a passionate team of marketing and technology experts in Southern California, MegaMeeting.com breaks down previous barriers and provides a seamless experience for web and video conferencing that anyone with an internet connection can use. MegaMeeting.com Web Conferencing is 100% browser-based, using open architecture and non-proprietary methods to allow people to share information and ideas over the Internet. Running off of Flash Communication servers, all Web Conferencing done through MegaMeeting.com includes powerful Video Conferencing capabilities, allowing participants the following benefits: Browser-based Video components - meaning there is no bulky, expensive or â€œproprietaryâ€ equipment required to conduct the Video portion of a Web Conference. With MegaMeeting.com, in order for an individual to be seen in a Web Conference, all they need is an Internet browser, a broadband Internet connection and a device in which they can be seen, either a web camera or a digital video camera. â€œMulti-pointâ€ Video capability - meaning that more than two people can simultaneously see each other from any and all locations throughout the world. With MegaMeeting.com, up to 16 separate individuals can be seen at the same time, and in the same Web Conference room. These same 16 individuals can also be seen by an unlimited number of additional Web Conference attendees. True Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP)- meaning that participants in a Web Conference can also talk and hear one another by using standard microphones and headsets MegaMeeting.com is operating system agnostic, meaning anyone that is using a Windows, Mac or Linux based machine may participate in a Web Conference. MegaMeeting.com Personal and Professional products are all hosted on MegaMeeting.com web servers in a secure data center, using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 128-bit encryption. The MegaMeeting.com services utilize the Real Time Message Protocol (RTMP) over port 1935, as well as the Real Time Message Protocol (RTMPT) over port 80 (tunneling via http) and the Real Time Message Protocol Secured (RTMPTS) over port 443 (tunneling via https) to allow audio, video and text chat to securely be transmitted from computer to computer. The MegaMeeting.com Flash Communication servers do not run any web services, rather, the Flash Communication servers provide the background ""heavy lifting"" for the secured browser page you are viewing during the meeting. Because we take Internet privacy and security very seriously, all audio/video streams between the MegaMeeting.com servers and an end-user's computer(s) are fully secure.","Hardware, Information Technology, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Messaging and Telecommunications, Privacy and Security, Software, Video",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
