We discover, curate, index, enrich, preserve, and distribute wild content, making it easy for libraries to deploy it across their organizations. Important works that have been absent from the scholarly record can now be accessible, safe, and permanently available. How we do it (with community) We’ve created a series of websites, called Commons, that bring together licensed materials, wild content, and tools for researchers, librarians, and students. Commons members share, suggest, upload, and contribute. The sites are created, improved, and grown collaboratively—with communities of librarians, expert researchers, and publishers. What we’ve achieved so far Students and researchers from hundreds of institutions across six continents use our Commons. We’ve helped drive new research, built out the scholarly record for fugitive items, and rescued the output of hundreds of discontinued organizations.

The product offerings consisted primarily of sealants until 1987, when Alpha and Uniroyal Elastomerics Company pioneered the development of EPDM rubber roofing for manufactured housing and RV applications. As Alpha Systems became the leader in that fast-growing market, it not only sold rubber roofing, but also developed and manufactured all the sealants and adhesives needed to provide a total rubber roofing system. Although the membranes have evolved over time, Alpha remains the leader in membrane roofing systems. 1994 saw yet another expansion with Alpha’s introduction of thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) roofing and flooring membranes. TPO, a performance-proven OEM product, provides superior resistance to UV light. This makes it a highly practical and durable solution for numerous RV, marine and household applications. Alpha acquired an injection mold company in November, 1997, allowing it to further expand its offering of plastic products. This acquisition enabled Alpha to deliver high-end injection molded products including automotive, manufactured housing, recreational vehicle and retail industry. Today, Alpha’s injection molded shutters and accessories can be admired on houses all across the country.","Design, Manufacturing, Other, Real Estate",,,51-100,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Arstat's products have proven efficacy and safety and focus on major areas of unmet medical needs in women's health: contraception for overweight and obese women, uterine fibroids and endometriosis, and painful and heavy menstrual periods. Arstat's high-value portfolio is protected by 10 granted U.S. patents (more pending) and a European (EPO) patent.    The pipeline includes 4 drug candidates with proven efficacy and safety. Two products are Phase III-ready (confirmed by the FDA), two other products are ready for Phase IIb. An addressable US market is approximately 50 million women with projected peak US net sales of $3.0 – 4.0 billion. The targeted global market may exceed 800 million women with significant European and worldwide sales.    Arstat's most valuable asset, Nuvocept, is the first and only oral contraceptive designed explicitly for overweight and obese women. The FDA has already endorsed an unprecedented clinical program and a potentially unique label. Nuvocept is expected to dominate a multi-billion-dollar segment of the U.S. contraceptive market  The Founder and CEO of Arstat Pharmaceuticals, Arkady Rubin, has over 30 years of industry experience (J&J, Pfizer) and is the co-inventor of Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo, the best-selling oral contraceptive in the U.S. with peak sales exceeding $500 million per year. Arstat is raising a seed financing round to hire key executives, assemble a top-notch Board of Directors ahead of a $50.0 million public offering one year later, potentially in conjunction with a strategic partnership or collaboration. Proceeds raised in the public offering would allow Arstat to advance its Phase III candidates through NDA filing, FDA approval, and sale or out-licensing in 3 - 3.5 years from the initial financing round as well as complete Phase IIb studies for its remaining candidates. Conservative estimates of the fair value of Arstat's product portfolio at the time of the public offering are between $500 – $800 million.",,1,Arkady Rubin,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
