Together, they saw that, while the Internet was becoming the world’s largest content provider, not everyone had the resources to create their own content. Together, their vision was to develop the potential of smart technology to provide news content and business information to Web sites and their users. The result was the creation of a content infrastructure services company with a top-notch executive team, powerhouse investors like CNNfn and the Walt Disney Company, and top-of-the-line technology. As the company grew and developed more applications for their Intelligence Engine, they outgrew the name NewsReal. In February of 2000, the name was changed to YellowBrix to reflect the optimism and possibilities of the Internet.","Other, Professional Services, Software",1,David C Hoppmann,51-100,2,Late Stage Venture,20000000,USD,20000000,20000000,USD,20000000,"Soros Fund Management, Holland Capital, Prime Ventures, AAC Capital Partners, Infoseek",1,5,2,Private,,,,,,
