Whether it's our family, a sports team, breaking news, Hollywood gossip, a hobby, a career, or a political issue, we obsess over our interests everyday. However, with an endless number of sources talking about an endless number of subjects, it's nearly impossible to find the best sources to follow to across your interests. And, even if you were able to identify the top sources, sifting through all of their content is maddeningly time-consuming. We built Sulia to address these problems (which were driving us mad too). Sulia’s subject-based structure of social channels connects trusted sources and enthusiasts on shared interests across thousands of subjects, including breaking news and events. How? We use a combination of network managers and sophisticated algorithms to identify the best-regarded sources across thousands of subjects. We then dynamically filter content from those sources, regardless of where it's created (a blog, a social network, a media site, through Sulia's publishing system, etc.), into high-quality, realtime social channels. The result is streams of timely content from trusted sources that is always on-topic, readable, and relevant. People use Sulia everyday to discover new sources and engage with their interests.

Leonard Japp, Sr. and a friend bought a rickety truck in 1927 for $50 - $5 down and the rest in payments. They picked up their first load of pretzels for $22.50. By 1929 the pair had a fleet of delivery trucks on the road, shiny new frying vats and fair reason to believe the best was yet to come. Then the stock market crashed. Japp proved resilient, however, bouncing back by the mid-1930’s with a new partner and a second go-round at snacks. The pair’s business flourished under their house brand, Mrs. Japp’s Potato Chips, until Pearl Harbor nearly drove them out of business because of the name’s negative connotation. ""We had to rename our company fast. The name Jays was available so we made it Jays Foods,"" Japp, Sr. said. With the potato chips back on the shelves under the Jays name they became Chicago’s premier potato chip. Jays bolstered its position in the market by including recipes on its bags of chips created by Japp’s wife, Eugenia. With his successful business Japp ventured into other snack territories and began manufacturing popcorn, pretzels and tortilla chips. Jays Foods remained under family control until a decision to sell the company was made in 1986. At a 90th birthday party for Japp, Sr. the rumor was that Jays was on the selling block. Leonard Japp, Jr. turned to his father and asked ""Do you want to go back to work?"" To which the elder replied ""Yeah, why not."" So the Japp family reacquired the company in 1994. Jays Foods was born again with the same commitment for quality snacks that has made them the Midwest’s premier snack manufacturer. Today Jays manufactures and distributes a full line of quality snacks including its signature Jays Potato Chips, O-KE-DOKE popcorns, Krunchers! Potato Chips, and a line of Hot Stuff snacks.","Food and Beverage, Manufacturing",,,1-10,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

In the last 20 years, those who own the data - MLSs and brokers - have been distanced from controlling, managing and monetizing it. They struggle with too many systems, too many third parties and too many inaccuracies. We’re fixing this. We develop software that empowers MLSs and brokers to directly control and manage access to their data so they can minimize risk and maximize opportunity. Our products enable single point of entry for listings data, 100% control over who can access it, and place brokers and MLSs in the driver’s seat of distribution. For MLSs, we’ve also built the vendor management and payment system you wish you had years ago. Our bullet-proof RETS server makes it all possible. We also give you full customer support because we know how urgent data issues are to your business. People like to complain that technology in the real estate industry is so far behind.

A cyber event in most cases goes against the insurance policy of the company attacked and can cause extensive damages to future claims, policy amounts, cost of doing business, cancellation, migration and hardening costs, proper data scanning and code rewriting. Costs associated with a cyber event or outage can be extremely complex and involve many parties, legal teams and infrastructure providers.   Aggregated costs associated could last years or decades and with more and more sophisticated attacks, social engineering and even employee involvement risk has never been higher.   Insurance company response teams are in most cases negligent, remote and lack the proper tools or hygiene to handle such matters and you require a step by step strategic approach in order to document and legally handle liabilities and reimbursements. Increased conflicts of interests are published and we do not recommend using Insurance company legal or forensics without representation and the proper protocols are followed exactly.","Data and Analytics, Energy, Financial Services, Information Technology, Navigation and Mapping, Other, Privacy and Security, Professional Services, Real Estate, Sales and Marketing, Sustainability",1,Anthony Patrick Urbano,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
