This way, users aren't shuffled from place to place before receiving the care they need and their insurers do not have excessive expenditures for those visits. By partnering with hospitals and other healthcare providers, Symptify gives mobile and web users a way to streamline their care once they are suggested to visit a medical professional. Symptify uses a HIPPA and HLA7 compliant transmission function that allows healthcare partners such as ERs, clinics, imaging centers and specialists to see the user's history of present complaint and all of those pertinent related symptoms that are queried during the user consultation. The hospital gets to engage and capture patients at the moment they are making an actionable decision to address their symptoms and have been given a possible diagnosis and a description of what they should do next.","Health Care, Software",5,"Brandt Delhamer, Jalil Thurber, Mazyar Rouhani, Nicola Marzola, Pierre Schiro",11-50,1,Seed,250000,USD,250000,250000,USD,250000,Code Particle,,1,,Private,,,,,,

King is an entrepreneur, leader, insurance coach, and real estate investor. He is passionate about shaping the next generation of leaders by teaching them the survival skills that are necessary for entrepreneurship. Vincent is a husband and father of 3, so securing the legacy and values of his family is very important to him. He knew growing up that working for someone else wasn’t the road he wanted to take and that helping to fulfill the needs of others was the best way for him to help fulfill his own needs. Vincent has a strong connection with people and has never had a problem excelling at anything that he put his mind to. Vincent grew up in a single-parent household, raised primarily by his mother, with a strong influence from his grandparents. In his early teenage years, he moved to live with his grandfather, who was a tremendous influence on his life. Vincent’s core business practices are a constant reminder and reflection of his late grandfather who instilled a lot of fundamental values in him that he still holds true today. He has been running his independent sales and marketing agency since 2013, which is responsible for the training and development of hundreds of sales agents, and millions of dollars in production annually. Vincent has had his share of ups and downs in his professional career and certainly been a part of things that he “thought” would provide him with financial independence. Still, none of those things could ever compare to what he has been able to generate and the lives he has been a part of changing since starting his journey as an entrepreneur. Vincent’s mission now is simply to help as many people that are genuinely seeking change in their life. He speaks on a range of business, leadership, and entrepreneurial topics, including how and why to become an entrepreneur and the importance of learning how to fully understand the survival skills needed to do so. He thrives in a culture of success, which is why he is “Driven By Results.” Vincent’s philosophy: “If it doesn’t challenge you, it will not change you!”","Education, Other, Professional Services",1,Vincent King,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
