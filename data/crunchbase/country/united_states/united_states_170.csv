Nearly 1/3 of the world population 2.2 billion people are on some form of social media platform. Considering around 25 years ago there were less than 50 million people in the entire world on the Internet this is a staggering change of opportunity. Social media is the new marketing. It's about you. Today you are the brand. Few business people have taken advantage of this new medium. Roughly 10 years ago the average person knew 150-180 people. Today that number has increased to 500-1000 people plus. Big change due to mobile devices, the Internet and social media. When surveying clients, the vast majority confirm they have never organized this valuable asset.  Mycity.com organizes the people you know. In turn, this asset becomes a goldmine of helping you increase your business. The old adage is people that give referrals, get referrals. 70-90 percent of new business comes from referral. This is precisely why so many referral organizations exist today.  Yet, referral groups are a reactive process. You are always waiting for people to refer people to you. The Mycity system is a proactive system. Here they ask you to rate people you know with 5 networking questions. In the Mycity system you work with your referral partners, query our database, search by vocation, location and rating to find the people you wish meet. Names are not divulged, just your partners name and rating of your interested vocation for creating the introduction. Now your referral program has become proactive. This program takes any referral group and fuels life into creating more referrals.","Internet Services, Media and Entertainment",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

For Secure Couture’s co-founders, brothers Alexander and Daniel Gladstone, the pain of this realization was personal; their own mother, as well as an aunt, two ex-girlfriends, and the sister of a family friend had all admitted to being violently assaulted on at least one occasion, with nearly irrevocable damage having been done to family and personal relationships as a result. In addition, several friends described the terror they experienced at the hands of stalkers, both at home and when travelling abroad. Further research into the rising prevalence of sexual violence against women on college campuses and the confounding inaction against it gave the brothers their calling: to create affordable and effective means to enhance the personal expression, empowerment, and safety of all those who are at risk. In 2011, work began on the first patents that would become part of Secure Couture’s unique IP. Throughout this period, the company iteratively developed new methods of embedding ever-smaller electronics into a variety of jewelry housing shapes. Today, those same methods are being employed in the creation and integration of embedded technology for the world’s leading fashion houses. During 2015, the fashion industry will deliver the first jewelry “Powered by Secure Couture(tm)”, and with their help, jewelry and fashion will be forever transformed into a vehicle to enhance the capabilities, the safety, and the lives of the wearer.","Community and Lifestyle, Consumer Electronics, Consumer Goods, Hardware",2,"Alex Gladstone, Daniel Gladstone",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
