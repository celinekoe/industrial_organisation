Steve Grundahl had been exposed to rapid prototyping technology while earning a degree from MSOE (Milwaukee School of Engineering) several years earlier and could never shake his fascination with it. Sensing a maturation of the technology and greater acceptance in the product development and manufacturing industries gave him confidence to take the plunge. Shortly after, satisfied customers began asking for additional services such as machining, fabrication, assembly and show quality finishing options. Larger part requests resulted in the addition of a second large scale SLA machine as well. The makings of a full service prototyping shop were well underway. By 2005, the acquisition of a local machine shop and hiring of a full time machinist meant that Midwest now occupied 4000 square feet and was ready for a bigger facility. By the end of 2006 the company moved into a new 18,000 square foot facility to enable future growth. This extra space allowed upgrades to several divisions of the business as new CNC machining and rapid prototyping equipment was installed shortly after the move. In 2008, the acquisition of longtime competitor Manitowoc Prototypes was completed and provided additional capacity for the rapid prototyping division. Along the way, urethane casting became another significant offering as customers began requesting that they provide that service. Recent years have brought more space with the acquisition of a second building that houses their CNC and fabrication shop. Their fleet of additive manufacturing equipment has continued to grow and has us positioned as one of the largest independent service bureaus in the U.S. They operate every day with a commitment to excellent customer service as they strive to be easy to do business with.",Manufacturing,1,Steve Grundahl,11-50,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,1,Private,,,,,,

Multilink’s expert engineering team co-ordinates all aspects of engineering from a concept through preliminary design, analysis, post processing & final design optimization to ensure the highest quality of design. Multilink maintains the state of the art CAD/CAM technologies. Their wide variety of CAD capabilities has always been an added value to their customers. Also, these design tools offer the engineers a luxury to reverse engineer various existing products from samples or drawings as the case may be. The design software also drastically reduces the need for a prototype for form fit and function verification thereby reducing their manufacturing costs. Additionally, the reduced need for prototyping substantially shortens the time-span between concept and finished production units. Multilink maintains a very good protocol of interacting with the customer during the process of design. This helps in the process of designing a customized product for the customer’s unique application. An E-drawing (3D CAD model- Self executable) can be sent out for review and approval before the product proceeds to manufacturing. The end user can take measurements off an E-Drawing file, rotate it, hide parts for better viewing etc. This provides an excellent opportunity for a detailed design review. The engineering team is heavily involved in an on hands exercise in several areas from manufacturing shop floor to the engineering test labs. They feel that this is necessary for a successful transition of a design from concept stage through prototyping and testing.",Manufacturing,1,Steve Kaplan,51-100,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Rather than having to create a study group then search for classmates to inform and invite, an alert is sent to every member of the class every time a new study session is created. Sympl. was formed by college students looking to discover ways to engage with classmates more and make the studying process attractive for students.

Unlike many other test prep offerings, PrepMe doesnâ€™t calculate the best lesson plan once, but continuously as you work your way through the material. Their system keeps track of what questions you get right and wrong, working you harder on the types of questions you miss. Additionally, customers can connect electronically, using email or real time chat, with high scoring college students who serve as tutors. In February 2007 the company announced that in conjunction with a philanthropist, they are making their services available to every high school junior in the state of Maine for three years. In 2008, PrepMe won a Chicago Innovation Award for its revolutionary approach to test prep. In 2011, the Software Information Industry Association listed PrepMe as one of its top 10 innovators for the companyâ€™s Coursificationâ„¢ platform. In July 2011, the company announced that its online classroom and Coursificationâ„¢ platform had been acquired by Ascend Learning, backed by Providence Equity.
