We’ve acquired over 300 subscribing customers in the US since 2006.  MKC is mature, and technically sound, but marketing investment and expertise is required to accelerate growth.  The MKC business derives revenue from 4 sources:  monthly subscription fees, email advertisements, on-line and mobile ads, and a program we call MKC-ad, which gives our users an opportunity to raise funds by selling the ad space on the emails sent from MKC to their Parents.  Groups lease the email ad space from MKC, and then collect revenue from local advertisers, keeping the difference for their organizations.  MKC is designed to be easy-to-use, self-serve, and focuses on the most critical and heavily-used features needed by competitive youth sports coaches and team managers.  This renders the MKC system highly scaleable, and minimizes support and computing resources needs.  MKC has been self-funded by the founder and his family since it's inception in 2005.  Total cash investment exceeds $110,000, and the founder has not taken any salary, bonus, or dividend over the company's history.  Marketing and sales investment has been limited, and yet hundreds of customers have subscribed to the service.  Development and other functions have been accomplished as inexpensively as possible using contractors located in the US and around the globe.  We believe that the company can grow exponentially with the appropriate investment in prospect conversion tools, site design enhancements, and marketing.  A viral business model is implied by the company's operational baseline:  coaches/administrators purchase subscriptions, then register the parents of their athletes.  So, one customer exposes 10 to hundreds of others to MKC for the cost of acquiring just the one customer.","Advertising, Sales and Marketing, Software, Sports",,,1-10,1,,110000,USD,110000,110000,USD,110000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Small colleges need good software, but it's often out of reach. Populi co-founders James Hill and Adam Sentz saw this firsthand in 2007 when they offered to help one school with information problems. The college used an outdated academics system. A dog's breakfast of spreadsheets, documents, and other low-cost programs stopped the gaps. This solution made hash out of student data. What's more, it was stored on a vulnerable desktop computer with no backups. Looking for something better, the college found a market cluttered with giant, unwieldy, enterprise-class information systems. These systems required new hardware and new staff. They'd need over a year to implement. And the start-up costs alone, never mind ongoing maintenance and support, would have deep-sixed the budget for years to come. But the college didn't need to settle for that. Stepping in, Hill and Sentz re-thought college software from the ground up. They wanted to avoid the pitfalls of the cheap solutions and the expensive bloat of the enterprise systems. So they built Populi, a secure, web-based program focused on simplicity, usability, and data quality. With the backing of EMSI, a tech firm serving hundreds of higher education clients (and where Hill and Sentz held their day jobs), dozens more colleges came aboard in the next two years. Serving these schools, the team that formed around Populi dedicated itself to giving good software to small colleges and backing them up with honest, responsive support. To accommodate the growth and help the team focus on small colleges, EMSI spun off Populi as an independent company in late 2009. They added 50 colleges in 2010. Heading into 2011, a total of 80 colleges were using Populi.","Education, Information Technology, Software",2,"Adam Sentz, James Hill",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Our homes include solid wood doors, tornado shelters, premium stainless steel appliances, 3cm granite or quartz countertops, all wood cabinetry, energy efficient shielding and insulation, home automation controls for alarm system, lights, and heating and air, as well as elegant walk in showers and plush carpet- all which cost extra to the customer by other builders. We have gained  a strong customer base by offering the features they seek in a home at the right price without a premium up charge for each feature.  In addition, we have tractors, trailers, and diesel trucks to take on heavy loads and deliveries without the added cost of renting. We also have an experienced payroll and accounting staff on hand to manage the funds and costs.

In 1993, NewTek, its founder, Tim Jenison, and this revolutionary product were presented with an EmmyÂ® Award for Technical Achievement. In 2003, NewTek was again presented with an Emmy for LightWave 3DÂ®'s seminal role in the revolution of CGI visual effects, over the preceding decade. NewTek has built its success on the concept of providing powerful, intuitive products at prices that are very affordable.
