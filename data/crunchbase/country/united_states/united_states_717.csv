Prior to founding Silver Bullet Technology in 1997, Clark was an item processing application developer for seven years. During that time, he developed OS/2-based CAR software using neural network technology. Clark founded Silver Bullet Technology in 1997, and began providing contract application development services to companies in the item processing industry. Over the next two years, Silver Bullet made its mark by assisting in the design of NCR's WiseIP interface, writing WiseIP software for NCR to drive 779X transports, and providing WiseIP training to NCR support group and resellers. During that time, Silver Bullet also collaborated with NCR and developed its first product— a 7780 simulator. That product, now known as IP Simulator™, is currently being used by most NCR resellers in the United States, making NCR Silver Bullet's largest customer. In 2000, Silver Bullet developed and released Ranger® for NCR and Unisys transports. Just one year later, Ranger was released for Panini S1 Vision series, SEAC RDS 6000 and 3000, and BancTec E-Series sorters. Silver Bullet also released another product in 2001— the first version of Bullet OCR. Silver Bullet furthered industry knowledge in 2002 by releasing a report comparing CAR/LAR engines, and continued to release products throughout the year. Ranger was enhanced to support Panini MyVision X, 20 and 50 transports, and an advanced version of Bullet OCR was developed using a patented Silver Bullet technology. Most notably, Silver Bullet developed and released several brand new products. Sidewinder was introduced for A2iA, Parascript, IBM CAR/LAR, Orbograph, Mitek and Unisys SoftCAR+ engines. Silver Bullet partnered with Panini NA and CheckTech to create the reject repair productMICR Mend and MICR Patch. Silver Bullet also partnered with Unisys and Firstar/US Bank to develop Chameleon, a product that allows Unisys applications to run unchanged on non-Unisys transports. Silver Bullet continues to provide critical tools, applications, and services to support check truncation in the United States. For the years ahead, Silver Bullet is working to ensure that all transports are sold with the Ranger interface.","Hardware, Software",1,Bryan Clark,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Magee, lawyer, newspaper editor and, most importantly, inventor of the world’s first parking meter. Magee moved to Oklahoma City, OK in 1927, a year before the 1928 opening of the Oklahoma City Oil Field. With the newfound oil came people, and with people came cars — lots of cars. Between 1913 and 1930, the number of cars registered in Oklahoma rose from 3,000 to a staggering 500,000, with most emanating from Oklahoma City and the surrounding area. Numerous oil related businesses sprang up in downtown Oklahoma City, bringing an influx of workers clamoring for parking spaces. However, oil wasn’t the only business downtown and retailers soon found their fortunes dwindling because customers had nowhere to park. By January 1933, the problem had come to a head. At the request of downtown retailers, the local government and chamber of commerce formed a joint traffic committee and appointed Magee, then editor of the Oklahoma City News, as its chair. Magee decided the best solution was to charge for parking using a small, mechanical timer in each space. He soon built a crude prototype and applied for a patent on December 21, 1932. To refine his design, Magee sponsored a contest within Oklahoma State College’s Department of Engineering. Prizes were to be awarded for a winning design and production of a working prototype. Although various designs were submitted, the students were unable to produce a working model.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Manufacturing, Transportation",,,101-250,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
