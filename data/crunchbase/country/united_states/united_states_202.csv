Beginning with an inaugural Space Games Challenge launching in the fall of 2016, SGF invites competitors of all ages, genders, and levels of ability or disability to design and develop their own games to be played in zero gravity. This is the extraordinary new world in which games like Quidditch become a reality. Submissions will be judged and voted on, with finalists vying for the ultimate grand prize of Official Space Game, to kick off the very first season of league selection and game play.   SGF is comprised of experts in the space and sports industry, featuring influential leaders and thinkers that are driving the growing mainstream popularity of space. Our team collectively envisions the past, present, and future of the space industry as invaluable to the human experience, and aims to marry entertainment and education — e.g, edutainment — to make this experience accessible to the world.

Along with being the home to many endangered species, Tiger World provides a safe space for Michael the white lion. White lions, also known as Panthera leo krugeri are legendary, and a folklore staple. They are only found in one area – the Timbavati region of Kruger National Park in South Africa – and are not, in fact, albinos but rather have leucism, a recessive genetic condition that makes the fur and mane turn white but does not affect the eyes or paw pads. You can see Michael in person by planning a trip to Tiger World. They offer educational guided tours and walkabout self-guided tours for its visitors, and is a family-friendly attraction. Their goal is to increase awareness of tigers and provide crucial education surrounding the beautiful animals.  The center is accessible for all visitors and was recently listed in ACCESS North Carolina, a travel and vacation guide for people with disabilities.
