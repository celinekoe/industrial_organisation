Presenting information in such concise chunks simplifies browsing the increasingly noisy infospace we all navigate every day.  TopTendency users can create persistent collections of lists pertaining to just those topics that interest them, then browse these collections whenever they want, clicking through to the videos, songs, stocks, blog posts, etc. that strike their interest, without having to browse the individual associated web sites. TopTendency can accommodate any number of lists.  While weâ€™ll continue to add lists ourselves, we expect the bulk to come from third-parties.  Weâ€™ve made it easy for anyone to add them, either via a web form, RSS, or our API.  The last allows developers to create scripts that collect information for a list on whatever schedule they want (daily, hourly, by the minute) and send it to us in a simple JSON post.  We think people will provide list info because itâ€™s fun, and for the 50-50 revenue split weâ€™ll provide from the ad (served by Google AdSense) on each list.  We specifically designed TopTendency so ads are tied to their respective lists, not the page on which all the lists in a collection appear, so the ads are highly targeted. Plus, users can suggest lists, and vote on each otherâ€™s suggestions, enabling developers to get a sense of what lists are likely to be most popular, and lucrative. Finally, TopTendency provides multiple intuitive search mechanisms that allow users to search for lists by keyword, tag, subject, popularity, and other dimensions, so even as we grow, it will always be easy to find what youâ€™re looking for.","Advertising, Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment, Sales and Marketing, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Moms need to connect with other moms, plain and simple. Other mothers are part of our lifeline. However, having only the common bond of children doesn't necessarily make us friends; we need more. And, in a world where families are moving frequently for new jobs, schools, opportunities, it is ever more difficult for women to find like-minded moms in a new area. Additionally, women often times are having to join many different sites and clubs to meet all of their needs (exercise clubs, professional networking, book clubs, etc.) so why not have it all in one place?  MoxTree will allow women to become members, create a profile, and search for other moms within a specific geographical area. They then have the option to 'auto-match' based on age range, children's age range, and further 'filter' based on common interests and hobbies. The customer can then create her own group. For example, she can place the profiles of other women in her 'exercise group' folder, her 'book club' folder or her 'professional networking folder', etc.  MoxTree is making connections between moms easier and focusing not only on the 'mom' component, but the entire mom/woman.
