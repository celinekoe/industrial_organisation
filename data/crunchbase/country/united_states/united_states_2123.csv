With Pricetack's selling format, merchants list items with a starting price that declines over time. Buyers can purchase immediately or wait for a discount. However waiting risks losing the item to another buyer. Automatic markdown pricing is good for both used and new items with limited supply. It is especially good for items that lose value over time or have an expiration date. Like standard auctions, falling price schedules can serve as a price discovery mechanism. This pricing format is particularly lends itself well to customer and prospect engagement since prices are constantly changing and items are coming onto the market as well as leaving.",Commerce and Shopping,1,Patrick Breitenbach,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
