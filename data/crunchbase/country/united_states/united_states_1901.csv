Currently, everyday athletes don’t have an intuitive way to easily connect with and engage in sports and fitness activities with like minded individuals.  We created a sports app to better connect everyday athletes based on interest, skill level and passion for the same activities. Users can discover other athletes of the same skill level by leveraging a ranking system of ability built into the app. By assigning others “knuckles,” users can rate their fellow athletes based on level of sportsmanship and physical capability. This allows users to engage comfortably and without fear of being outmatched. Users can either host or find sporting activities across 40 sports including basketball, cycling, tennis, running and soccer in cities worldwide including launches in Los Angeles, New York and Miami. We are bringing together everyday athletes to connect and grow their network to sport together.    Check it out - we'd love to hear your feedback.
