The company's biomarkers help pharmaceutical companies identify disease targets and pathways, and validate mechanisms of drug action; serve as pharmacodynamic indicators of drug activity, drug response, and drug toxicity in clinical development; and to avoid drug failures in late stage trials. Its FGM data analysis technique helps in the mapping of genetic pathways involved in the diagnosis and prevention of certain diseases. The company's technologies and discoveries comprise a subset of genes that separates benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) from prostate cancer and BPH from normal tissue patterns; a genetic biomarker signature, which identifies prostate cancer based on analysis of tissue samples; a set of leukemia genes that separates ALL-T-cell leukemia from ALL-B-cell leukemia; colon cancer-specific biomarkers, which are used in the development of diagnostic assays for cancer detection, disease discrimination, and potential vaccine; and an AIDS expression signature that separates AIDS brain cells from non-AIDS brain cells. Health Discovery Corporation also licenses its breast cancer diagnostic technologies, such as MammoSIGHT for detecting malignancy in mammograms; and MetastaSIGHT for identifying circulating tumor cells in the blood. The company was formerly known as Direct Wireless Communications, Inc. and changed its name to Health Discovery Corporation in November 2003. Health Discovery Corporation was founded in 2001 and is based in Savannah, Georgia.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",,,11-50,1,IPO,475000,USD,475000,475000,USD,475000,,,,,Public,2003-11-14,,,HDVY,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/health-discovery-ipo--bedfaa28,OTC Pink

Vidoop has developed a method by which logging in to any site will require only one username and no password. Its login technology precludes users from having to create new passwords and names through a software-only two factor system.  The system is called Vidoop Secure.  It is differentiated by the way it authenticates users; through the use of categorized images.  When users sign up for the service they chose a set of secret image categories (dogs, boats, trees etc.) that become their visual password.  To sign into a site, users click their image from an ever changing grid of pictures. The result is a secure method of authentication that requires human interaction, yet very little of it. Vidoop provides web single sign-on using the OpenID protocol, but can also manage your web identities for sites that don't support single sign-on.","Information Technology, Privacy and Security, Software",2,"Joel Norvell, Luke Sontag",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
