We then typically stay on the matter as our client's personal advocate, interfacing with outside counsel and providing input on all strategic decisions and ensuring that legal spend is kept to a minimum. How We Do It  Our principals are all licensed attorneys with decades of experience in private practice at some of the largest U.S. business law firms and as senior in-house counsel at a prominent global investment manager. Each member of our team has a diverse background in international business and commercial law – from corporate matters, asset sales, acquisitions, and expansion – to litigation, dispute resolution, and mediation.  Our mission is to remove the exclusive control that law firms have over their client, which only benefits their firm.   We find the right professionals for our clients' needs without alliances to any specific firm. This prevents our clients from paying unnecessary legal fees, and they only get services they need.   What It Costs   The question on everyone’s mind.  Our job is to reduce legal spend, not increase it.  We charge a nominal fee to consult with your company and get up to speed. After that, we generally charge a one-time small transparent flat fee. No surprises or hidden costs.  And we usually pay for ourselves right away through immediate savings from outside counsel you would not receive without us.

RovingBox has launched a service to benefit those who find traditional self-storage options too inflexible and expensive. The RovingBox website (www.rovingbox.com) helps match local homeowners whom have unused storage space in their garage, attic or basement with people who need storage space for their personal items.       ""RovingBox provides a great way for homeowners to earn passive income by simply renting out a corner of their garage to people who need storage space for their stuff.  For the homeowner it makes good financial sense, and renters benefit by having a storage space that is often more affordable and flexible than they’d otherwise get by signing a lease on a traditional storage unit."" says Zachary Price, Co-founder of RovingBox. “With the rise of the new ‘Sharing Economy’ we saw that the Self-Storage industry could use a makeover. Our service upends traditional self-storage business models by creating a marketplace where people can list and rent unused space. We are excited to help homeowners to make extra money every month, while providing would-be renters with inexpensive and environmentally friendly storage options in their neighborhood.” How RovingBox.com works is simple. All homeowners have to do is create a listing on RovingBox.com which includes photos and a description of the space for rent, plus and what their ""House Rules"" are (what a renter is able to store and when they can access their stored goods). Those needing storage or parking can search the RovingBox for storage options in their area and then request a booking. The space owner is then able to review the request and discuss all details and concerns with the renter before confirming the request. Getting paid is easy; once the home owner just accepts the offer and the renter moves their things into the space, RovingBox charges the renter’s credit card and deposits the rent payments into the homeowners banking or PayPal account.  To establish security and maintain trust between renters and homeowners, RovingBox.com offers: •	A public rating system on which RovingBox customers rate each other based on a set of criteria. •	A messaging system that enables people to chat and get to know each other before confirming a space rental. The system is also used for requesting rental space access. •	A three-day refund guarantee.

We assist people to advertise on our website to promote their affiliate, business, or franchise.  The purpose of Business Combined is to collaborate with companies to generate income for both businesses. Business Combined will always have specific missions, but as the owner, there are many opportunities to be successful and there could be many different ways to be successful. Outside of my business, I am working closely with two franchises that I would like to get started as soon as possible. Both businesses will be advertised on my website to boost the sales of each business.  One of the franchises is online and does not require a lot of effort, while the other requires tremendous effort. Once I close on these franchise deals, I plan to pursue opportunities that will continue to help Business Combined as a company grow and recruit more members and have sales with its customers.","Internet Services, Other, Professional Services",,,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,
