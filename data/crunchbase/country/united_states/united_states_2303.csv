Established in 1992, the company quickly formed a reputation in the natural gas market. At ITERA, we are known for our contributions to the energy market of Russia.  Our business spans the globe. We have come to prominence in gas field development, and have invested billions in our eight fields in the Far North of Russia. We have also become leaders in several other industries, such as construction, industrial engineering, and electric power development. The company has remained profitable and competitive thanks in part to the management expertise of our CEO. Igor Viktorovich Makarov has kept the company on its course to success, while maintaining a focus on the community.  Makarov’s passion for business started in the 1980s. It culminated with his formation of the company. Its successful transition from a small production and trading company to a large international corporation occurred thanks to him. The company’s many projects, needless to say, create jobs wherever we go. This is not the only way in which we give back to the community. Many of our projects, such as the steam-gas power cogeneration plant we’re building in the Nizhny Novgorod region of Russia, provide vital services.   ITERA International Energy Company Gives Back Here at ITERA, charitable activities and sponsorship are one of our highest priorities. Our Council on Charity and Sponsor Activities keeps us in touch with the needs of the community. Established in 2003, the Council seeks out socially meaningful projects and sponsorships, ensuring our continued support. Our background in charity is extensive. Starting in 2003, we’ve been involved in dozens of large-scale projects that benefited thousands. Here are some of the most notable examples: •	Tchaikovsky Medal Award: In 2003, The Tchaikovsky Fund for National Music Development presented us with a medal for contribution toward the development of Russian music. We sponsored a music festival in Moscow, where the work of famous composers was performed by competing choirs. •	Vision-Impaired Children: We have a long tradition in providing books to children with eye disorders or partial blindness. In 2005, we made our first donation of 300 books to Kindergarten classrooms. We did the same in 2010 and again in 2012. •	Flight of Hope Project: In February of 2012, we supported a project to preserve and increase the white crane population of Uzbekistan.  These, and many others, serve as the foundation for our charitable traditions. Our business has remained successful because of the community, and we are determined to show our appreciation. ITERA International Energy Company is a driving force in the world—of both charity and international commerce.","Energy, Sustainability",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

It is also often the most popular podcast in the country, with around one million people downloading each week. From 2006-2008, they produced a television version of This American Life on the Showtime network, which won three Emmys. They are also the co-producers, with NPR News, of the economics podcast and blog Planet Money. And a half dozen stories from the radio show are being developed into films. In 2014, they launched their first spinoff show, Serial, a podcast hosted by Sarah Koenig. There's a theme to each episode of This American Life, and a variety of stories on that theme. It's mostly true stories of everyday people, though not always. There's lots more to the show, but it's sort of hard to describe. Probably the best way to understand the show is to start at their favorites page, though they do have longer guides to their radio show and their TV show. If you want to dive into the hundreds of episodes they have done over the years, there's an archive of all their old radio shows and listings for all their TV episodes, too.","Community and Lifestyle, Content and Publishing, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio, Video",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
