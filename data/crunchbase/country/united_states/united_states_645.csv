Once youâ€™ve optimized your shopping list, you can print it, head to the store with a mobile version, or continue to a retailer's website to research or purchase products. Groceries are the largest retail market in the world. The average American household spends over $6,400 per year on food - more than four times the amount they spend on travel. Consumers rely on specialized travel search engines like Kayak, Expedia, Orbitz and Hotwire to help them sort through thousands of travel options. We believe that consumers should have the same type of tools to help plan a trip they make twice a week: to the grocery store. Grocery Server LLC was formed in August 2010 as a joint venture between Qponix and MyGroceryDeals.com, by an international team of retail, marketing and technology veterans. Grocery Server is headquartered in Ann Arbor, MI and has offices and R&D centers in Seattle, WA, Ottowa, Ontario and San Francisco, CA .
