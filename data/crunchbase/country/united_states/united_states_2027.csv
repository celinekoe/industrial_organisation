The service is offering a whole new dating experience taking the best out of the online and offline world. BestDailyDates requires very little time spent online, and maximizes the number of dates the members will actually go on. The members can find out if they really have chemistry offline without wasting a lot of time online. The sign up is very simple, and user friendly. The members can later upload photos, provide more information about themselves and their preferences to further refine the matches. The member follows three easy steps. It starts with posting a specific date idea (example: Otto Pizzeria, 1 5th Avenue, New York, NY, any Wednesday evening), accept someone's date idea, or have your date idea accepted by others, and go on a date. Matching date ideas with profiles are emailed to members regularly, and are also available in members' profiles. This online dating site allows members to save time. Unlike other traditional online dating sites, BestDailyDates does not require browsing through thousands of profiles, or going through full inboxes of irrelevant messages. Members base their decisions on both date ideas, and profiles attached to them. The ideas speak for themselves, the profile provides additional information, and after accepting a date, members are welcome to further communicate to finalize the date. BestDailyDates makes it easy, efficient, and simple.
