Their idea was to create a multilingual auction forum for individuals and businesses to buy and sell merchandise quickly and conveniently. Because the concept was to create a community in which everyone from around the world could participate in the Internet revolution, the founders chose to name the company eOrbis.com which comes from the Latin term orbis meaning ""world."" The first eOrbis.com website debuted in November of 1999. Today, what began as an idea, has grown into a large multicultural and multilingual e-commerce community joining thousands of members of products and items.","Commerce and Shopping, Other",,,1-10,1,,2500000,USD,2500000,2500000,USD,2500000,Gallagher,1,1,,Private,,,,,,

This site was designed to allow New York Giants writers and fans an opportunity to decompress and just talk football. I do not believe in ranking writers or pressuring them to contribute regularly. The members and readers come and go as they please and appreciate the relaxed environment. They keep the chat and comments clean and provide a safe place for readers of all ages. We discuss a very specific topic which is NFL football. The readers on. nygreporter.com has been featured on multiple sports sites, TV shows, podcasts and publications. Some include Giants.com, USA Today, NFL Network, NFL on NBC, SNY Network, CBSSports.com, FOXSports.com, Mike Francesa Show, Eisen's Insight podcast and NJ.com just to name a few. The previous goal of being partnered with shop.giants.com has been achieved and completed. The nygreporter.com website now offers official New York Giants merchandise for all of the fans looking to purchase Giants gear. nygreporter is not affiliated with the NFL or the New York Giants at this time.  UPDATE: Recently, in November 2011, the founder (RD) has become the sole writer for the website. RD, has cultivated a brand name and has decided to be solely responsible for any content published from now on. The nygreporter name is respected in the social media sports community and built on the family friendly atmosphere that is monitored daily. This includes websites such as twitter, Flickr and wordpress to name a few.  We have been doing free pre-game and post-game shows LIVE on twitter for two years (as of 11/22/11) and have established a loyal fan base. It has been a wonderful experience meeting new folks and making friends. I'm certain that @nygreporter would benefit any company interested in sponsoring a 2 hour pre-game show and 2 hour post-game show LIVE via twitter.  Email nygreporter@yahoo.com for serious offers only and get the specifics. We always keep in mind that kids read our stuff too and that is why we ask you to keep everything family friendly please. Thank you!","Sales and Marketing, Sports",1,Robert Domaine,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
