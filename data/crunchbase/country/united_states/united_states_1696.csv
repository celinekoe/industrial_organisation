From its Wall Street area offices, DGI provides experienced strategic counsel to a select number of clients aimed at increasing their visibility, bringing them face to face with investors, and successfully managing their financial communications to achieve fair long term market value. The firm’s principal focus in recent years has been on U.S. investor and public relations for a growing number of foreign and domestic small and micro-cap companies, including several in the “ about to go public” stage. Working with smaller companies, they are able to use their extensive “big cap” experience to establish a credible IR and PR function and couple this with a well honed talent for scoping out and building upon what makes each client uniquely attractive. As needed, they bring into each situation a wide network of reliable contacts and associates to assist in such areas as boosting trading volume, adding market makers, developing research coverage, obtaining financing, as well as bringing companies public. They also have an outstanding track record in media placement, both electronic and print. Prior to founding DGI, Ken Donenfeld served as executive vice president of D.F. King, advising a variety of companies as well as such dissident shareholders as Carl Icahn and Harold Simmons on investor relations, corporate communications and media relations. Previously, after beginning his career at Georgeson & Co., he became executive vice president of Robert Marston and Associates, a leading independent public relations firm. At Marston he directed financial media and investor relations programs for several “emerging growth” companies as well as such industry leaders as Anheuser- Busch, Wang, and International Multifoods. Donenfeld became a recognized leader, too, in creating IR and corporate communications programs for European companies whose shares are traded in the U.S., introducing to U.S. investors such companies as Novo Industries, Pharmacia AB, Gambro, ADT, And London International Group. At DGI, Donenfeld added a heavy concentration in the Dutch market, building U.S. awareness of such leading companies as KBB, Randstad, and Vopak. The firm also gained recognition for pioneering work on behalf of emerging Eastern European companies. Other clients have included: Pentair (manufacturing); Grow (chemicals); Equity Oil (energy); Uni-Invest (reits); Eiger Technology (electronics); Coda Octopus (marine technology/ security); Gevity HR (human resources management) which ranked among the leading gainers on NASDAQ in 2007; and CyberDefender (Internet Security).","Administrative Services, Community and Lifestyle, Government and Military, Professional Services",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The market is not saturated at this time and competitors do not have the expertise or the experience that we have gained over the last 20 years.     We are publisher of online, interactive textbooks (iTextbook) for students in English- and Spanish speaking countries.    The U.S. textbook market is $6 billion for grade levels 7 to 12. For those textbooks the States pay. For college courses students pay.    Today, Amazon offers eBooks for their Kindle reader. They are convenient and informative, but are not able to utilize the full power of a computer since they are not interactive.    With the online College Tutor system a student learns, does extensive homework problems and simulated finals for which he receives self-assessment scores. Uses any device that connects to the Web and has a keyboard. We have our own private “cloud;” there is nothing to download or to install. Student registers, and is on his way. Teacher uses another program to assemble exams from our database in very short time. Students use paper and pencil or, with the help of yet another program, take those exams cheat-proof over the Internet.     With our College Tutor, we offer color, still-, and moving media in 2-D and 3-D, sound, homework projects, exams, and self-assessment. In addition, we have the entire infrastructure available to serve students and teachers alike that could turn our system into an online school.    Great care was taken and no expenses spared to make the system convenient, fast, and cheat- and hacker proof. For example, during exam time students may sit next to each other with their laptops but still would have great difficulties to copy from one another.    Exam scores are relayed back to the student for feedback, and to the teacher and a designated regional/state assessment center for evaluation. Education policy makers will have instant information in their hands that up to now they can only wish for.","Education, Sales and Marketing",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
