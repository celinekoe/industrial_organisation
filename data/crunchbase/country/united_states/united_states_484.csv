XpenseWise works by analyzing data from a user's household bills. They get this data either automatically, as they pay bills online with your EBPP (electronic bill presentment and payment) service, or directly from the user, via fax or manual input. XpenseWise also gathers preference and credit data to build a complete user history. Financial institutions can use this data base to identify customers' bank product holdings and needs, and effectively cross-sell them additional bank products. XpenseWise uses the database to match user's histories to better value offers in the marketplace for non-bank products such as long distance, cell phone, insurance, etc. Users love the savings they get with XpenseWise, and will thank you for bringing the service to them. Protecting your customer's privacy is part of their reason for being. Users must opt-in to use XpenseWise.
