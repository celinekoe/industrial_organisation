Services can be anything from housekeeping or logo design to a video chat with a chef helping you perfect your favorite recipe. The goal is to connect people who need help with something to someone who is available to help them. What's the story behind it? MyPeople was an idea that came to our Founder & CEO, Melissa Strawn, while she was a struggling single mom in the Bay Area with two kids to support. A short-term disability left her unable to work and she dreamt up a creative way to get her needs met while still being a valuable contributor to the economy. Melissa and her husband now have five sons and need a community of help more than ever before! They utilize the services of many of the helpers on the site and still provide services of their own. Why is this so important to you? Glad you asked! Not everyone fits into the typical workplace model. Some people have disabilities, familial responsibilities, or lack access to skills or transportation to get to the jobs that will pay them what they need. And some people just want to call their own shots! We are building a trusted community of people who offer their unique skills, talents, and services so that we can see a world where all people can earn a living doing only what they love. This comes with the bonus of knowing that you are helping lighten the load of someone else.","Internet Services, Other, Transportation",1,Melissa Strawn,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The result is a precise and dimensionally accurate casting that meets stringent industry standards. CFS Foundry's dedication to quality extends beyond the casting process itself. Our experienced team of engineers and metallurgists closely monitors every step of production, from design and pattern-making to final inspection.

Equipped with the latest email marketing technology, such as zip code radius targeting, image hosting, and custom email templates, MailerMailer allows easy creation of professional email newsletters and campaigns. HISTORY Brothers Raj and Vivek Khera founded MailerMailer in early 2001, shortly after selling their previous venture, GovCon, to a publicly traded company in 1999. GovCon, which they founded in 1995, had quickly become the largest government contracting portal in the world. As they grew GovCon, the Khera brothers faced several challenges around sending weekly newsletters to their client base. The in-house tools they had did not offer tracking capabilities or list management to handle bounces and unsubscribe requests automatically. The only available email marketing tools for small businesses at the time were expensive and cumbersome to use. So, when the duo sold GovCon and set their sights on a new venture, they saw an opportunity to help other companies manage their email newsletters at an affordable price. Their goal in creating MailerMailer was to develop an intuitive email marketing tool for non-technical people. They kept in mind that most of the “high end” features in other services are only be used by a small percentage of clients. This put the focus on the most commonly used features that a small business would want in an email marketing tool and on the interface to make the user experience very friendly. As MailerMailer began acquiring larger customers, they were part of the early dialogues with ISPs to build whitelisting processes that are in place today.","Information Technology, Internet Services, Messaging and Telecommunications, Sales and Marketing, Software",2,"Raj Khera, Vivek Khera",11-50,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
