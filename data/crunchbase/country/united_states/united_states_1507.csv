The incentive is created by the student and Ultrinsic each contributing money to the final reward that the student can earn by achieving the target grade.   For instance, if John, a student, is taking a Math 101 and wants to receive $200 dollar if he gets an A- or better, John can go to Ultrinsic and for instance contribute $100 to his incentive.  If he gets the A- or better he receives $200 if not, then he receives nothing.   Ultrinsic puts college students in control of their own motivation and lets them reap immediate rewards, making school a fun and exciting experience.
