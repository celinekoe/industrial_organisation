In 1994, this company achieved that goal, announcing the accomplishment through a patent called the ""Creativity Machine,"" a computational paradigm, already 20 years in the making, that came the closest yet to emulating the fundamental neurobiological mechanisms responsible for idea formation. Within months of this patent's issue, international corporations, the US government, and the press (e.g., MSN, Scientific American, New Scientist, and Economist, among others) were asking for more information, leading to diverse contracts in materials discovery and consumer products. In 1997 this same sentient neural paradigm was chosen by a major US defense contractor as the control system behind a constellation of communication satellites that contemplated how best to distribute petabytes of critical information to the country's armed forces around the world. Similarly, the intelligence community frantically approached the company in August of 2001, requesting a cost-free license to its Creativity Machine based semantic parsing software to mine the Internet for terrorist activities.
