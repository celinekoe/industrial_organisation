PA SportsTicker Enterprises operates as a sports news information service provider in North America. It delivers instant scores, breaking sports news, statistics, previews, recaps, and features of baseball, football, basketball, hockey, college football, college basketball, golf, tennis, soccer, auto racing, and horse racing. The company serves radio and TV stations, broadcast and cable networks, newspapers, wire services, interactive media, on-line services, paging services, multimedia, and various electronic publishing applications in North and South America, and Japan.  PA SportsTicker Enterprises was formerly known as Baseball Ticker and changed its name to SportsTicker Enterprises LP. Further, the company changed its name to PA SportsTicker Enterprises following its acquisition by PA Sport Limited. The company was founded in 1909 and is headquartered in Cheshire, Connecticut. It has additional offices in the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Singapore, China, and South Africa. Before Stats LLC purchased the company and laid off its entire editorial staff, the company was located in Cheshire CT. It also was located in Bristol CT. That was when ESPN, which had owned the company since 1995, decided to move the wire service from its waterfront office in Jersey City. The move occurred July 11, 2004 and it shook loose many of the editorial staff, who were unsure of what would happen with the company. Roughly two years into SportsTicker's time in Connecticut, the company was sold to a British enterprise called PA, which stands for Press Association. Besides an editorial staff and statistical staff, the company also employed a network of roughly 700 to 800 reporters in the field, who were regulars at stadiums and arenas of all four major sports and other events. Those reporters provided real-time updates, content for the wire and quotes from athletes, coaches and others for this content.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment, Sports",,,,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

CrazyFitnessGuy is a website that promotes and explores healthy living through the perspective of an autistic college student. What Makes Us Different From The Other Health And Fitness Websites? Our competitors like to talk about fitness, nutrition, workout clothing, and many other healthy living topics. We noticed that they do not talk a lot about how to get started or how to get motivated to start living a healthy life. Furthermore, we have not seen them talk about healthy living from an actual Autistic perspective like Jimmy Clare. Everyone has a different approach to healthy living that's why there are so many workout programs and nutrition programs to choose from. Why Did Jimmy Start CrazyFitnessGuy? Jimmy started CrazyFitnessGuy because he wanted to educate people about alternatives methods to becoming happier and healthier; methods that did not require the use of medication. One other reason was to share his health and wellness journey through the eyes of an autistic student. What Can You Expect From CrazyFitnessGuy? You will find a wide variety of topics that include: Reviews Fitness Self-Help Nutrition Lifestyle Autism Managing Stress If you don't have time to read all of our articles then we suggest listening to the healthy living podcast that we publish monthly. Who Is CrazyFitnessGuy Meant For? CrazyFitnessGuy is for anyone who: Wants to lose weight but doesn't know where to start Needs motivation and inspiration Needs someone they can relate to Someone who is on the Autism Spectrum as I am Needs someone who has been through bullying and other challenges in their life Needs someone who will not give up on them What Is The Driving Force Behind The Brand? Our driving force is to help people all over the world who are Autistic and for those who are not to start living a healthy lifestyle.

The hardest part when it comes to eating healthy and working out is starting. That's why we are here to help motivate you to get started.

After several years of focusing entirely on the Enterprise market by building white label platforms to spec for some of the largest global companies (in telecommunications, finance, and news) Blogtronix released a new version in 2009 which allowed for simple plug and play installations in either a software or SaaS configuration. Later in that same year, Edno23 was acquired, and a robust microblogging platform was introduced to the world, which has since received over 50,000 downloads. Today, with over 30,000 communities in 170 countries, Blogtronix has adopted the new moniker of Sharetronix, which better reflects our overall mission of allowing our users to more easily share information without being encumbered. In pursuit of our dual-pronged goal to both expand into new verticals within the Enterprise space, as well as encourage adoption among smaller sized teams, divisions, and SMBs, we have assembled a new management team and brought in expertise from both the professional services and financial realms.

Their flagship product DevDesk Tabz is being introduced as a SaaS platform where companies and individuals can find, organize and share online apps & URLs while accessing these favorite applications from a single interface.  Tabz provides the ability to create corporate marketplaces where employee application administration can be consolidated or public-facing partnership portals can be promoted. The Tabz platform is the first step in creating an environment for corporate chain supply management: equipping companies to intuitively manage access rights and permissions to granular levels thus controlling varying degrees of transparency for sharing information with their unique audiences.  The product introduces companies to a variety of applications aimed at facilitating business development and operations while providing the flexibility to incorporate existing legacy systems or bespoke corporate portals into the environment.  The Tabz platform thereby facilitates the creation of custom integrations and migrations between disparate apps, cloud-based environments and on-premise hardware or software which ultimately leads to higher employee adoption of evolving technologies. DevDesk will be introducing modules to further promote the consolidation, visualization and tracking of data across multiple companies and technologies: a concept they have coined ""Multi-Business Management"" (MBM).  The primary goal of their MBM suite of tools is to manage multiple businesses, subsidiaries, trades, brands and independent operations from a single source.  Core modules such as CRM, Salesforce, Property, Project and Document Management are being introduced to address this goal and revolve around their founding principles of â€œconnecting people, places and projectsâ€.   As more information is collected, participants will be able to opt-in to industry-specific information sharing programs to gain insight into unique metrics within their field.","Information Technology, Internet Services, Mobile, Professional Services, Real Estate, Sales and Marketing, Software",1,Steve Woolsey,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
