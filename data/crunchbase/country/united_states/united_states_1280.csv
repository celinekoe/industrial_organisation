Combining existing leading-edge, piezo-technology printing with three-dimensional rendering software permits the production of 3D physical models. As fascinated as the public has become with the promise of physical 3D rendering, the objects produced seldom posses adequate physical properties for practical use.   ChemCubed’s goal is to harness the promise of 3D printing with application-specific engineered emulsions conceived for end use. Each end use combines the most basic values of digital process, wherein each end-user requires a personalized and specific output, produced with a common hardware platform and a common chemical emulsion. Variable data is the ingredient that renders the physical output “user specific.” The first commercial product-effort of ChemCubed is in the aerospace industry, building mechanical and electrical parts specifically for energy efficiency in manufacturing and in aircraft.

It will offer in-depth coverage of high-end computing at large enterprises, supercomputing centers, hyperscale data centers, and public clouds. If you’re looking for a more detailed overview of the vision, read the Editors’ Introduction or, if that’s too wordy, a) you might be in the wrong place and b) reach out to the editorial staff for more specific info if you need it. In essence, The Next Platform was founded on a few central concepts… Some companies are building their own platforms for internal use, while others are building platforms for others to use to run their applications as a service. Inspiration for platform designs is coming from the hyperscale data center operators that have pushed the boundaries of scalability for new kinds of analytics, as well as from supercomputing centres that have been scaling up simulation and modelling workloads for decades. Regardless of where the inspiration originates, all platforms have some common characteristics. They are based on an integrated stack of hardware and software, tuned to run specific workloads, and outfitted with orchestration tools to automatically react to changes in those workloads. The idea is to break down as many silos in the data center as possible, virtualising system components and mashing them up in interesting ways to increase the efficiency of the underlying servers, storage, and networks. The Next Platform will step behind the headlines and provide analysis to help readers understand what technologies are used to solve particular problems, how they are integrated with other systems and applications, why organisations choose particular technologies to solve their problems, and why they do not pick something else.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment, Software",1,Nicole Hemsoth,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

To meet local hiring needs, ZippyApp provides unique hiring web pages for each business location – whether you have one location or 10,000. These hiring portals are accessible via a custom URL or a custom QR code to facilitate discovery. ZippyApp hiring portals provide a description and list of available jobs for a given location. The jobs can be posted and closed with just one click by even the busiest local manager.
