The medical field is changing. Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements hinge on HCAPS surveys (patient satisfaction). Patients behave like consumers. Malpractice lawsuits are common. There are more patients than available physicians. Access to healthcare is a hot topic and means more than just whether a patient has insurance or not. It literally means was a patient able to get an appointment before they became so ill they showed up at the ER with sepsis, heart failure, kidney failure, liver failure, etc. Medical conditions that could have been easily managed in the early stages become financial disasters at this point that cost insurers, patients, and CMS an extraordinary amount of money. Had the patient been able to access healthcare in a timely manner, debilitating health deficits and money would be saved. In extreme cases, human lives could have been saved. Checked In, LLC aggregates wait time data by geolocation allowing patients to choose a healthcare facility that is readily available to treat their healthcare needs. In addition to saving lives, publishing patient wait times has many benefits for healthcare providers. It increases providers’ bottom line: Improve visibility, Decrease liability, Decrease insurance costs, Increase patient satisfaction, Increases patient safety, Increase reimbursements, Evenly distribute patient population across healthcare systems so one facility is not overwhelmed, while a nearby facility is underperforming, Records patient data & trends. The intention of our applications is not to place pressure on organizations and staff to shorten how long customers wait for service. Our intention is to influence patients’ expectations to be realistic, allowing your organization and staff to provide high quality customer service in a way that values your customers’ time. Checked In, LLC mobile applications are a time management tool that improves customer satisfaction through patient experience and back end performance metrics. Patients behave like consumers and are looking for customer service that is timely and efficient. This often places pressure on organizations and staff to rush in order to meet patients’ wait time expectations. Rushing is dangerous, because mistakes can happen and these mistakes ultimately decrease the quality of patients’ healthcare and in extreme cases lead to sentinel events.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Health Care, Other, Professional Services, Software",1,Brianne Casey,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

This tradition was started after a local store’s advertisement for kids to call Santa on a special “hotline” included a misprinted telephone number. Instead of reaching Mr. Kris Kringle, the number put kids through to the CONAD Commander-in-Chief’s operations “hotline.” The Director of Operations, Colonel Harry Shoup, received the first “Santa” call and had his staff check radar data to see if there was any indication of Santa making his way south from the North Pole. Indeed, there were signs of Santa, and children who called in were given an update on Santa’s position. Thus, the tradition was born.
