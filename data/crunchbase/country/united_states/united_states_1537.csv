The trust relationship begins when potential investors can see — for free — how well our performance has been on a quarter by quarter basis.  Unlike many other investment advisors, Pariveda has nothing to hide with regards to our performance.  Other financial advisors might say “just trust us, we know what we’re doing,” but will they open up their financial performance data? Knowledge, honesty, and “openness” are the important factors in developing a trusting environment between a client and Pariveda. Pariveda, Inc. is a privately held, fee-only Registered Investment Advisor serving the wealth management needs of individual and corporate clients across the United States. We currently manage client assets from our office located inMenlo Park, California. Simply stated, Pariveda’s goal is to outperform the market by 3-5% over a complete cycle (and on an after-fee basis). Most academic research reports that an investor cannot beat the market rate of return.  Perhaps the financial services firms have realized this because they offer index or life cycle mutual funds which basically follow the market indexes like the Standard & Poors. But at Pariveda, if we cannot outperform the market by 3-5%, then you should take your money and invest in one of these index-like funds. Pariveda has no potential conflicts of interest that could adversely affect our performance and we receive no commissions or incentives to cloud our investment judgment. We simply evaluate the investment landscape for the most attractive offerings in each market sector and allocate client assets appropriately.",,1,Brian P. Murphy,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
