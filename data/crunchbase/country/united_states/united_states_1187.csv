Pterofin products are controlled by a simple counterbalance system that synchronizes the wings’ position and speed with a mechanical leverage point on the body of the device. The outcome is a coordination of harmonizing the wings pitch angle to a natural frequency of a fluids specific velocity, allowing Pterofin to be extremely efficient at pumping water or generating electricity.  Engineer Carl Baker with PNNL, under the Technical Assistance Program, has confirmed the technology works, saying, """"The design concept is effective in capturing energy from any moving fluid – wind or water... If a kit consisting of a very few simple and inexpensive parts (and some plans or general directions) could be provided to individuals, they could construct a micro-scale generator system using mostly locally-obtained materials. A very small generator system would also provide sufficient power to recharge a cell phone or LED flashlight over the course of a day. Making these devices available to low-income people in developing economies could provide a considerable improvement in quality of life at a very low cost.""  Co-inventor and Professor Robert Breidenthal, from the University of Washington College of Engineering explains, ""The exploitation of novel physics, like nonsteady effects in aerodynamics, is an attractive approach to develop green energy technologies. The key idea with the nonsteady aerodynamics of wings is that it takes time for a boundary layer to separate. So when you pitch an airfoil up suddenly, the vorticity in the boundary layer takes time to move up away from the surface. As long as it is close to the airfoil surface, the lift coefficient can be very high.""
