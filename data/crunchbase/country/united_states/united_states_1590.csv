(AKW) provides big data analytics and machine learning software systems and services to increase production and reduce costs of upstream E&P and midstream pipeline gathering operations. The unique AKW team combines more than 80 years of energy industry expertise with big data scientists experienced in building real-time intelligent systems with forecasting and optimization capabilities for better decisions, actions and operation performance. AKWâs patent-pending technologies combine machine learning and optimization into the PALMâ¢ (Petroleum Analytics Learning Machine) software product suite, which manages a set of applications named Machine Analytics Products (MAP) for multi-variant analysis of combined datasets from geology, geophysics, rock physics, reservoir modeling, drilling, hydraulic fracture completions, production and gathering for delivery to markets. PALMâ¢ is more sophisticated than anything used in the petroleum industry today. For example, PALMâ¢ predictive and optimization technologies use proprietary time-series shape recognition and real-time decision trees to automatically steer fracs to classifications that we invented, the combination of which over 10âs of stages, is statistically more likely to produce high volumes of hydrocarbons and eliminate low producers, saving millions in operational costs, all in real-time. AKWâs value proposition was developed and tested in a prime ultra-rich wet gas shale play with a best-practices independent oil and gas company in the United States. Profitability increases across the life of each well using PALMâ¢ were estimated to vary from 35% in wet gas wells to 50% in NGL wells. Just the savings from the multi-dimensional analyses across all company silos were estimated to add an additional 10% to the profitability of the company in that region.","Data and Analytics, Energy, Natural Resources",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
