The unique AKW team combines more than 80 years of energy industry expertise with big data scientists experienced in building real-time intelligent systems with forecasting and optimization capabilities for better decisions, actions and operation performance. AKW’s patent-pending technologies combine machine learning and optimization into the PALM™ (Petroleum Analytics Learning Machine) software product suite, which manages a set of applications named Machine Analytics Products (MAP) for multi-variant analysis of combined datasets from geology, geophysics, rock physics, reservoir modeling, drilling, hydraulic fracture completions, production and gathering for delivery to markets. PALM™ is more sophisticated than anything used in the petroleum industry today. For example, PALM™ predictive and optimization technologies use proprietary time-series shape recognition and real-time decision trees to automatically steer fracs to classifications that we invented, the combination of which over 10’s of stages, is statistically more likely to produce high volumes of hydrocarbons and eliminate low producers, saving millions in operational costs, all in real-time. AKW’s value proposition was developed and tested in a prime ultra-rich wet gas shale play with a best-practices independent oil and gas company in the United States. Profitability increases across the life of each well using PALM™ were estimated to vary from 35% in wet gas wells to 50% in NGL wells. Just the savings from the multi-dimensional analyses across all company silos were estimated to add an additional 10% to the profitability of the company in that region.","Data and Analytics, Energy, Natural Resources",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
