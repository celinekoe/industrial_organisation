He believed that everyone should have access to technology and the benefits of the Internet, not just those who can afford to spend $500+ on a new computer. Max was also interested in consumer cloud computing and open source software. Why should people get roped into spending hundreds of dollars in licensing fees for certain software applications, when there were better products that could be had for free? You should be able to do phenomenal things with an inexpensive laptop computer. With all of the amazing technology that is available, why hadn’t anyone created one? Max took this idea and ran with it – straight to Stanford University. While working with the students at Stanford, he came to realize that most people don’t need all of the bells and whistles that traditional computers come with. If you only need to check emails, listen to music, surf the web, watch the occasional video and use an office suite, why incorporate anything else into the machine? With the help of the people at Freescale, Max and the students were able to build the first prototype. By creating a computer that only featured what most people needed, the team was able to create a laptop that used 90 percent less energy and 80 percent fewer parts. Thus, the green machine was born. Still, it needed a name. During a review of the prototype, one of the students commented that the laptop was “sweeter than an Apple!” Another student chimed in, “What’s sweeter than an Apple? A Cherry!” Since the laptop was built to last from the start, ideally becoming the user’s trusted friend for years, the idea of calling the laptop Cherrypal came up. The name stuck. In 2008 we officially launched our first product, the C110 desktop computer. Seven hours later, we had to close the store. After receiving 2.5 million hits on our website the first day, we were completely sold out. The C110 got upgraded to the C114 and then C120, it is still the most energy efficient desktop computer in the world. Based on user demand we evolved into a latptop and teblet computer vendor. The Cherrypal Africa, is a 7” mini laptop that costs just $99. Have we officially bridged the digital divide? No, not yet. But we’re working on it.",Hardware,1,Max Seybold,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

It has become the recognized standard for geographic and geodemographic analysis for colleges and universities. For the past ten years our client list includes over 400 academic institutions from large, public universities to small, private colleges. Several months after CMT was formed, a separate dba, Applied Marketing Technologies (AMT), was added in order to better address the different targeting needs of the non-academic sector. Over the past several years, AMT's applications ranged from continuous database management and maintenance for a large Sears franchising organization, to direct mailing applications for one of the largest theme park conglomerates, to profiling/market potential projects for national products, travel and tourism, non-profit organizations, financial institutions, food distributors and retail outlets. Site analyses and mapping have been conducted for museums, libraries, major chains and radio stations. Additionally, AMT clients are from a wide spectrum of industries and applications: one of the top insurance companies, a shoe company, a Florida convention bureau, two NFL Franchises, fast food chains, cruise lines, hotels, newspapers, and several major advertising agencies. CMT/AMT personnel have been cited in the Wall Street Journal, US News & World Report, The Chicago Tribune, The Christian Science Monitor, Philadelphia Inquirer, New York Times, The Daily Herald and numerous local and college-oriented publications.

Under many of today’s health insurance plans you could end up paying the majority of the cost of your MRI exam due to high deductibles and co-pays.  The cost of an MRI exam can be many times higher at a hospital facility than at an independent imaging center like OpenSided MRI.  You should determine your out-of-pocket cost before having your MRI exam at another facility. Comfortable, Relaxing Environment for your MRI Our “open” MRI system accommodates all patients, especially those who are claustrophobic or just anxious about the exam in a short-bore closed MRI system.  Aside from that difference, “open” versus “closed”, often patients don’t realize the MRI exam is essentially the same regardless of where it is done and usually lasts less than an hour. However, our center is dedicated solely to MRI in a comfortable and relaxing outpatient setting, unlike what you may experience at a crowded hospital or multi-modality center. Accurate, Fast Exam Results What is important is the diagnostic interpretation of your exam results to be accurate and provided quickly, timely scheduling for your exam, quality and compassionate customer service throughout, and, now, as the financial burden has shifted from your insurance plan to you – the best price for an MRI exam. OpenSided MRI proudly excels in all these areas and you should expect no less from any other provider of MRI services. You are the customer and have the right to choose where to have your MRI exam done and to expect high quality customer service at a reasonable price.  We are sensitive to the shifting financial burden being put upon you and will work with all our customers to make your MRI exam affordable.",Health Care,,,51-100,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
