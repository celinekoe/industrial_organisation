With our long list of trackers, you can record, store and analyse as much as you need, quickly, easily, securely and with privacy. Whatever your health goals are, healthstored is here to help you and your loved ones achieve them. Why we are here Health tracking would be so much more powerful if all your data were all in one place. Using pen and paper, multiple apps or sites to track different things is slow, complicated and restricts the value you can get from your records. You can't access the true potential of your efforts. There are also some health issues that would really benefit from tracking, such as headaches, alcohol, smoking and drugs, but are largely ignored elsewhere. We're here to change that. So many categories With 17 categories for you to choose from, whatever you need to monitor in your life, we've got it covered. From the more common things like weight and exercise to categories like headaches and menstruation, you can now track it all in one place. Alcohol	 Blood pressure Blood sugar	 Body measurements Cholesterol	 Diet Drugs	 Exercise Headaches	 Heartrate Height	 Menstruation Peak flow	 Respiratory rate Sleep	 Smoking Weight	 More to come! Quick and easy We have tried to make healthstored as quick and easy to use as possible. We know that you're much more likely to stay the course if it only takes 30 seconds a day to do it. The app will let you add records for all your chosen categories. To change which categories you're tracking, visit the website. Use your data We have a full suite of tools on the website which allow you to view your data as you like. Tables, graphs, reports, exporting data, it's all there. We want you to get the maximum benefit from your data, leading you to a healthier future. After all, that's what we're all doing this for, right? Don't forget your loved ones This is a real game-changer for those of you who want a single place to track your health and the health of a loved one. Maybe that loved one is a freshly-minted bundle of joy, a family member in your care, or just someone that you are concerned about enough to help out. Our system allows you to track up to five others, with customisable category lists and data analysis for each of them. Give it a try, and you'll quickly see how easy it is to do! You control your data We don't believe in locking you into a system by jealously hoarding all your data. You have complete control of your data, so from the website you can export or completely delete all of your data from our servers, quickly and easily.  Something else close to our heart is data privacy. You can rest assured we are not sharing your data with anyone else. Your data is here and here only. It simplifies things for us, and hopefully gives you some peace of mind. Evolve Everything you see here is only the beginning of what we want to do. We have many more ideas to bring to life, but there are only so many hours in a day. We also want our users to play a vital role in defining the future of healthstored. Don't hesitate to let us know if there's something here you'd like to see. Premium To help you get started, we will offer the first 30 days free. Hopefully in this time you'll come to love our easy-to-use service. Once those 30 days are up, you can either upgrade for a low, low price of $24/year, or continue with the free package to your heart's content. The free package restricts the number of simultaneous categories you can track, doesn't allow the tracking of others, and has a few adverts dotted around. ""Why have multiple tiers??"" we hear you cry! As mentioned before, we don't want to share your data around to all and sundry. This is what most 'free' sites do as a means of getting paid, and we want to try a different way. Hopefully you'll join us.","Apps, Mobile, Software, Sports",1,Paul Daniel,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
