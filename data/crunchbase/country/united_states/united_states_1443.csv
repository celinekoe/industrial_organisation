Take the time to find out what contaminants may be in your water and how they can effect your health – not only when you are drinking it but when you are breathing the fumes and showering in it as well.

Playmark's marketplace bridges the gap by making business deals involving athletes as easy as e-commerce. Professional athletes can now sell official rights, content, and access. What began as a strategic partnership with the NFL Players Association became a new venture when George Aposporos and Erik Bergsagel founded Playmark in December 2010. Playmark's online and mobile platform was built from ground up to increase access to the largest professional roster in America: over 2,000 NFL players. Playmark has a multi-year exclusive with NFL Players. Since the launch of Playmark.com in October of 2011, Playmark has reduced the average time to close a licensing deal with NFL Players from 35 weeks down to 2.
