It enables users—both government contractors and employees—to build tailored profiles in order to identify teaming and contracting opportunities based on capabilities, certifications, past performance, and other criteria.    Co-founder and CEO, Tom Skypek, who formerly worked for federal contractors Booz Allen Hamilton and SAIC in Washington, D.C., says his company is focused on solving a major pain point for government contracting professionals. “They’re a true business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-government (B2G) social network. They’re the Match.com for government contractors. Looking for a woman-owned business with expertise in environmental consulting? Or a veteran-owned business with expertise in cloud computing? GovBizConnect is your solution.”   Government contractors are able to build tailored profiles based on their unique capabilities and certifications. Government employees such as contracting officers are able to build profiles and search for qualified small businesses. GovBizConnect features 40+ data fields, real-time activity stream, private messaging, and a mobile-friendly design.    The CT-based startup has been signing up users since April of this year. “They’ve been hearing from small government contractors, large primes, and government contracting officers—all of whom are looking for a better way to find teaming partners and contracting opportunities,” explains co-founder and CTO, Chris Malinoski, who earned his PhD from UConn.    Co-founders Skypek and Malinoski grew up together in Connecticut and decided to start GovBizConnect after Skypek returned from Washington, D.C. “I saw firsthand how difficult it was to finding great teaming partners and wanted to solve that problem. It’s 2015 and there’s no reason that the process can’t be more data-driven and streamlined. If they modernize this process, the companies win, the government wins, and so does the taxpayer. That’s why they started GovBizConnect.”","Government and Military, Professional Services, Science and Engineering, Software",2,"Chris Malinoski, Tom Skypek",1-10,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
