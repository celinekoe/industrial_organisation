Sentio MMG® smart-sensors are different from all other forms of neuromonitoring electrodes. In contrast to electromyography, or EMG, which relies on needles to detect subtle changes in electrical signals in muscle, Sentio MMG® smart-sensors employ proprietary accelerometer technology. These non-invasive accelerometer-based sensors measure MMG (mechanomyography) activity, or the mechanical “twitch” associated with muscle contraction. When MMG activity is detected, the surgeon is provided with a ‘STOP’ alert indicating a nerve has been identified. The result is an intuitive, surgeon-directed tool for establishing safe access in a variety of surgical applications. Sentio MMG® was specifically designed to facilitate safe lateral transpsoas surgery.

NPA was founded with the goal of “securing good to the Independent Oil refiners of Pennsylvania and Ohio.” The Western Petroleum Refiners Association was created in 1912, merging with the Texas Petroleum Refiners Association in 1920 and with the Arkansas-Louisiana Refiners Association in 1936. NPA and WPA, which had worked together over the years, merged in 1961 to become the National Petroleum Refiners Association. In 1998 they became the National Petrochemical & Refiners Association to reflect the important role of petrochemical manufacturers in their association and in America. Today they are the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, a name selected to more accurately described who they are, what they do and how they benefit the American people.

As the use of QR codes, SMS short codes and mobile campaigns become more ubiquitous there is a rising demand for a more interactive and dynamic end user experience. Traditional QR codes have a fixed action programmed into them, often sending the user to a web site, or video, that isn't optimized for their mobile device.

Liqueo Inc. provides anyone selling anything to anybody the ability to automatically create a template based mobile micro-site for each item in your inventory. Micro-sites are mini websites optimized for viewing on a mobile device. The micro-site itself is dynamic too, having as many as ten unique actions to choose from. From the micro-site, shoppers can link to other websites, download photos and documents, fill out feedback and contest forms, view other micro-site pages, share over social networks, and watch high quality streaming videos. Users can upload their videos into the Liqueo's platform in any format where it is encoded and stored on the Akamai CDN in more than a dozen formats and sizes. When a viewer chooses to watch the video, the platform intelligently streams the correct format and size based on the viewer's mobile device.

With a current membership of more than 8,300 members, MKC was founded in 1965 by the merger of three neighboring cooperatives in Moundridge, Buhler, and Groveland. Since its founding, it has grown in size and territory through mergers and acquisitions. More than 325 employees play an important role in the growth and success of MKC. Thirty-five grain locations offer combined elevator space of 36.6 million bushels (42.2 million bushels with Canton Terminal). Wheat is the major crop grown, with receipts averaging more than 10.5 million bushels per year. The area is fortunate to have a strong aquifer underlying much of its trade territory allowing irrigation of corn and soybeans. In an average year, MKC will receive as much as 3 million bushels of grain sorghum, 8.6 million bushels of corn and 3.7 million bushels of soybeans. (Receipts are based on a five-year average.) Providing agronomy services to the member owners is another important aspect of business at MKC. Crop nutrient and protection needs, seed, seed cleaning, custom application and a complete line of rental equipment can service almost all of a producer's needs. MKC's continued reinvestment in their facilities helps to provide environmentally safe and secure locations to handle nearly 100,000 tons of crop nutrients applied to the crop ground of MKC's customers. Using GPS technology, MKC agronomy service centers apply crop nutrients and crop protection products to more than 850,000 acres of cropland. MKC provides crop consulting and precision agriculture services for producers.  MKC offers 24-hour fuel service at a number of locations throughout Kansas. With a regional cooperative refinery located in the center of its trade territory, competitive fuel prices for customers, and a fleet of bulk fuel delivery units, total fuel sales for the past year were over 20 million gallons of diesel fuel and gasoline. Much of the feed grains raised by producers in the area go towards supplying feeds to a diversified livestock industry in the area. This is an important part of the cooperative's sales with wholesale and retail feed sales to customers producing swine, beef, dairy and poultry. MKC and four other area cooperatives have formed a partnership with Countryside Feed which has an annual feed volume in excess of 150,000 tons.",Agriculture and Farming,,,251-500,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
