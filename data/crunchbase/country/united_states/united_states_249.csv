He learned the basics of construction technique, geometry design and the science of bicycle fit from the resident frame builders at R&E Cycles. In the 4+ years he worked for the Seattle shop he helped hundreds of individuals become more comfortable and efficient on touring, sport, racing, mountain and tandem bicycles. This solid foundation in traditional frame construction is augmented by his formal education in engineering and art. Dave has always worked creatively wiath metals, from BMX bicycle builds in high school to metal sculpture at university. The pride and sensitivity of an artist and craftsman, coupled with the analytical skills of an engineer, afford him a unique ability to create bicycles that are aesthetically appealing and functionally precise. Dave enjoys working with his customers one-on-one, fulfilling their specific needs and matching each bicycle to the rider's individual body and style. Ti Cycles was founded in Seattle in 1990 as a means for Dave to focus on constructing lighter, higher performance frames in titanium, while continuing to craft custom frames in steel. In line with Dave's wide-ranging experience, Ti Cycles caters to all levels of bicycling enthusiasts, offering custom or production-built frames and forks in both steel and titanium. To that end the company has built well over 1500 custom frames for a diverse roster of clients, each weld an answer in the perfect solution to their cycling needs and desires. Dave has himself been an avid cyclist for decades and has some 30 years of cumulative experience in the bicycle industry. A licensed USCF and NORBA racer, experienced tourist, commuter and tandem rider, and enjoys all types of cycling. His passion for cycling in all its forms allows Levy to draw on his diverse experience when helping customers make crucial decisions about their bicycle. Ti Cycles takes pride in forming strong and mutually satisfying relationships with customers, and is committed to advancing the state of the art while maintaining the traditional high standards of craftsmanship for which the legends of custom frame building have come to be known. The brand relocated to Portland, Oregon, in 2002 and commemorated its 20th anniversary with the opening of a new, 2300-square-foot fabrication facility at the end of 2010. Dave Levy currently serves as the president of the Oregon Bicycle Constructors Association. In addition to hand building custom titanium and steel frames and forks, Ti Cycles also produces a wide range of components and accessories, from seatposts, stems and handlebars to cargo and touring racks. For those who have had the misfortune of purchasing a frame with another brand only to see it fail, Ti Cycles also does steel and titanium frame and fork repairs. By most accounts TCF has done more repairs than any other shop in Portland, including alignments, tube replacements, disc brake tab add-ons, S & S coupler retrofits and painting. If your frame or fork needs modified or repaired, Ti Cycles Fabrication can do it. For more information or to request a repair quote, please visit their Services section.

Would Rocky have been able to beat Clubber Lang (a.k.a. Mr.T) without ""eye of the tiger"" playing in his training montage. We here at H2O Audio think not. They also believe that the inspirational and spiritual power of music should not be reserved only for the Rocky Balboas and other land loving athletes of the world. As surfers, wakeboarders, paddlers, and swimmers we encourage H2O Audio users to experience their music in any element. Like many other inventive business endeavors the seed of H2O Audio was planted in graduate school, i.e. FedEx. The first brain child of the founding fathers was a waterproof CD case fashioned with a pair of crudely engineered waterproof headphones. At the time people couldn't fathom, pun intended, the need for an underwater music player. Fortunately for swimmers, surfers, wakeboarders, paddlers, and water enthusiasts everywhere they were not deterred. In 2002 a plan was set forth to design an mp3 housing that would allow users to take their music anywhere and everywhere. The result was a waterproof housing for the iRiver mp3 player that can operate at depths of up to 200ft (DV Series.) In 2005 the H2O Audio family evolved to accommodate the leader in personal mp3 players, Apples iPod. As Apple continues to alter the handheld music player universe and the demand for waterproof protection increases H2O Audio will continue to offer the best waterproof iPod cases and waterproof accessories in the industry. Lap swimmers will suffer in silence no more, triathletes will conquer land and sea without missing a beat, and rock and roll will no longer be just an obstacle and a survival maneuver for kayakers.

Neuralgene will be working in conjunction with Helica Labs in Playa Del Carmen, Mexico for the production of it’s gene therapy. PRCN-829 was developed from concepts learned with stem cell treatment of ALS. It was determined that stem cells produce substances that inhibit the process of ALS. The problem with stem cell therapy used alone, though it can be beneficial, it does not seem to have permanent lasting results. This has been shown with several different stem cell treatments in regards to ALS. PRCN-829 was developed to provide the benefits that occur with stem cell therapy, but to amplify and lengthen the effects.
