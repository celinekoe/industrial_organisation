If you have been in any type of race, competitively or for fun, ‘take your mark’ is the cue to get yourself ready to start. The same applies in swimming. And for President Colin McNamara this brings him back to his competitive swimming days. When the official stated those three words, it meant game time. “I felt that by naming my company this it would be a constant reminder, for myself and the team, that now it's time to put all of your training and practice to work,” explains McNamara. Take Your Mark believes that there are a lot of similarities in the fundamental principles in business as there are in sports. This is why many employees are former athletes or sports enthusiasts, because they can relate to the mindset and culture of the organization. Not sure what that means? Keep Reading. 1.	Team Work: It doesn’t matter if one person has a standout game or even breaking records. If the team loses – no one can truly reap the success as much as if they had won together. Another example- it’s not just about being the best person on the team, if your team is the worst in the league, it doesn’t mean too much. Similarly, at Take Your Mark, everyone is working together to improve each other and themselves so they can accomplish greater things.  2.	Sharing a Common Vision: What would happen if a sports coach had the belief, vision and goal to win a championship but the rest of the team didn’t? Would it happen? Never. At Take Your Mark, management makes it very clear what the corporate vision is to ensure that employees share that vision. When you work with like-minded individuals who share a common goal, magic happens and championships are won. 3.	Failure is Not Final and neither is Success: You lose a game. Is the season over? You win a game. Does it matter at the next one? You had a bad season, lost the championship. What about next year? In business, there are going to be good times and bad. Take Your Mark focuses on how you bounce back from your failures and what you learned to improve for the next time. They also know that just because you’re doing well does not mean that they can relax, you must keep working, because there is always someone out there who is working just as hard to beat you! There are many other things that you can relate Take Your Mark’s business philosophies to core beliefs in the sports world, but those are our top three.

Smart GPS Back Pack LLC and its executive, management and business development teams have the insight and capabilities to bring to the marketplace a series of early learning tools that will help promote, cultivate, and enhance interest and subsequent skills in young children, age two to five and above. Its products are geared toward reaching young children who are able or unable to attend Voluntary Prekindergarten (VPK).  Each year the US falls further and further behind the rest of the world in educational standards, performance and rankings (www.ed.gov, 2010.) To spark any child’s interest and provide them not only with early learning skills but also time to play while learning, Smart GPS has developed its Captain Smart USA cartoon characters and accompanying back packs, learning tools, media, and accessories that will be upgraded ongoing to keep pace with technology advancements. All products are bilingual English-Spanish and have the potential to be translated and marketed outside of North America. The additional GPS option for tracking location of children is unique to the Captain Smart product line. The animated, child-friendly characters teach positive life lessons, encourage gender-neutral exploration of role models, promote communication, and provide self-practice tools for learning basic skills.  Sales channels for the products are e-commerce online sales, infomercials, media distribution,   and traditional retail outlets. The Captain Smart product lines are projected to catch-on and proliferate much like a Snuggles or Hooked on Phonics.

The slogan and description of our I.P. is below: “Tapping the brakes” to slow the growth of healthcare spending ®. SES Score® is a healthcare reimbursement innovation utilizing patented algorithms that measures current capacity in a micro-geographic region. The algorithms produce a score which is available to insurance companies, third party payors, self-insured employers and government agencies, including Medicare and Medicaid. SES Score® alters the reimbursement methodology to providers. Adjustments can be lower payments in over-supplied areas, or increased payments in under-supplied areas. For the first time in history, a patented innovation now allows adjustment of healthcare reimbursements within a micro-geographic area based upon supply and demand economics. Healthcare has resisted a normalized application of pricing economics, but better late than never. While SES will initially deal with diagnostic services, it will evolve over time to encompass all healthcare services and help rationalize U.S. healthcare services to produce a much needed slowdown in the growth of U.S. healthcare spending.","Health Care, Professional Services",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
