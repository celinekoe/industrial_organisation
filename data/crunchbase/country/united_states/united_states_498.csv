But despite these ambient changes, a few time-tested values persist that are integral components to any effective Investor Relations campaign; a clear understanding of the client’s financial strength and business model coupled with strong writing and strong relationships that effectively disseminate the client’s business model and potential. And it must be all of these working in concert or the client’s message will be lost in the cacophony. Their campaigns are built upon the fundamental acceptance that a clear understanding of the client’s prospects interwoven with strong writing… crafting a message that resonates with investors and the media… is critical to culling and keeping interest. They believe that the effective conveyance of a properly constructed message to an appropriate audience repetitively and over time will yield results. It’s the foundation of any advertising and the quality copy they craft makes this happen more quickly and with greater traction. It’s what they do best. And while they are engaged in eloquent and effective communication they shun the hype and tout garbage far too common in the small cap arena. They accomplish their lofty goals without spam emails, shady social media posts, call rooms, or paid analyst ‘buy recommendations.’ If you’re looking for hit-and-run liquidity events, kindly turn elsewhere.

Strong community tie in has been key to  this business. Pizza King is a traditional Hoosier staple in rural communities, with many former small town residents having moved to Indianapolis, a ready market where strong brand awareness exists. The wonderful thing about Pizza King loyalists; everyone has their own Pizza King story and  experience with the flavor of Pizza King Indianapolis and have expressed how happy they are to now have a Pizza King available to them.  The growth of Pizza King Indianapolis is planned out in three stages. The first stage was to establish brand awareness in Indianapolis through carry-out and delivery services. These are marketed and accomplished through social media, direct mail and earned media.  Traditional call in ordering is offered with Pizza King Indianapolis and also  online ordering services through  its website,   www.pizzakingindianapoliscom, the companies Facebook page www.facebook.com/pizzakingindianapolis, and the custom iPhone and Android app, offered on iTunes and the App Marketplace.  Since opening the delivery service on March 11, 2014, 341 individual customers have ordered online with 299 phone in orders. Currently the average customer orders 1.4 times with an average order total of $44.15. Original plans to only offer delivery service until a brick and mortar location was established quickly changed with customer demand to also offer carry-out services to meet the demand for Pizza King loyalists that lived outside of the delivery zone.  The second stage is to open Pizza King Indianapolis’s first brick and mortar store once demand and brand awareness was established. The third stage is to expand and offer additional brick and mortar locations throughout Indianapolis with no more than three stores planned at this time. The view of the company is that the Indianapolis market can comfortably sustain three stores without saturating the existing market.  In its current format Pizza King Indianapolis employs five employees with two full-time and three part-time positions. The brick and mortar concept is expected to employ as many as 9 full-time employees with five to seven part-time employees depending on the season. All employees starting wage is established at $10.10 so that each will have access to a living wage. Additionally, all employees will participate in tip sharing, it is each individual staff members duty from the order taker, the pizza maker, delivery driver, and dining room steward to make the perfect pie , and to create the most positive experience for each patron. This will reward each full-time staff member with an estimated income of $29,400 before taxes. Full-time staff members will also be eligible for 100% of their health insurance premium to be covered with employees maintaining an average of 25 hours a week to be eligible for 50% premium coverage. It is in the opinion of the company that this will create emotional buy in from staff members and cut turnover, ensuring a long future of profitability and same store sales growth.  To date the founder has invested $49,000 in personal funds into Pizza King Indianapolis and is now seeking outside resources to expand operations. It is estimated that $220,000 in additional","Administrative Services, Food and Beverage, Transportation",1,Aaron Schaler,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
