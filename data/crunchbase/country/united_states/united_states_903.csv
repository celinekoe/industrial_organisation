This story seems complete, but what if we flipped the story on its head and told you that David was supposed to beat Goliath? We believe that is the truth of the story. Regardless of David’s physical size, he was a projectile warrior- experienced, trained and feared as a slinger who could strike in seconds. Goliath, on the other hand was slow and weighed down by armor. It’s a fight that David was equipped to win. He fought with courage, poise and accurate action, but most importantly, he fought for his people. At Thompson | Wedeking, we feel this view on the ancient story closely parallels our own. This world is full of giant odds. When the stakes are high, and your livelihood is on the line, you will need to call upon someone to step forward and take a stand in the face of uncertainty.

The goal was to expand this to a broader base of hobbyists using the aholics.com domain. For various reasons, the vision shifted and was born in 2003 as an eCommerce Integration Network, allowing companies to quickly build an on-line storefront system with limited skills.  Themes were available and automated, business-to-business product resale, shipping calculations, drop shipping, and credit card processing were handled by the company...allowing anyone to start selling products on-line in quick fashion.   This shift in direction was to be followed by the initial vision a couple years later, adding communities to storefronts and fostering addictions with both product and friendships.  The original vision was never realized as the business closed it's doors around 2007 due to financial reasons.

The Redoxagens are designed to hack into redox-mediated mitochondrial signaling pathways to turn on cellular self-repair mechanisms. They differ from the regular drugs: instead of targeting a single xenobiotic mechanism, Redoxagens induce multitude of redox-mediated cellular self-repair signaling pathways in normal cells and cell death in cells with high reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels/severe oxidative stress (i.e. cancerous). ROS and mitochondrial substrates potentiate Redoxagens - making their action specific to redox sites of electron transport chain (ETC) inside mitochondria and plasma membrane redox system (PMRS) and cells with elevated ROS levels. Once they reach the redox process/ROS-rich environment Redoxagen API, Geroxane, is consumed producing ROS-burst after which redox activity returns to normal = no chronic toxicity. This results in a dual mode of action:  a) in normal cells where redox activity is confined to mitochondria, activation of  Redoxagens is triggered at PMRS or at ETC sites inside mitochondria and induces on redox-mediated mitochondrial and cellular self-repair signaling pathways b) in cancerous cells where energy production/redox activity is localized to the cytosol or in cells with severe oxidative stress where ROS concentration in cytosol is already high, activation of Redoxagens results in ROS burst in cytosol, which brings ROS concentration to toxic levels and triggers on cell death. Redoxagens have been tested in over 300 humans and over 8,000 horses against numerous diseases with profound success and without serious adverse events. Our principal focus is development of treatments for the Dry form of Age-related Macular Degeneration. Our veterinary subsidiary Ogenx Animal Health is focused on development of treatments against Canine Lymphoma and Mast Cell Tumors and Equine Infectious Diseases.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",1,Dmytro Berezhnoy,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
