Today, VersusLaw continues to broaden its focus and mission: to provide all legal practitioners access to current, in-depth, easy-to-use legal research, regardless of the size of their firms, by using the power of technology.

Even when they possess the data, brands lack the time, skills, and tools to identify and act upon insights that enable them to grow sales and operate efficiently. Current 3rd Party analytics providers are siloed by sales channel, expensive, and often no more than data collection entities, thus home-grown analytics solutions that yield limited insights have remained the dominant solution across the industry. Snowrise's vision, Analytics For All, reflects our belief that all brands can benefit from analytics services that address a plethora of common challenges, similar to what materialized for bookkeeping and taxes decades ago. Our philosophy is that successful services need to be, in priority order, Actionable, Affordable, and Advanced. The lack of AI is not the reason emerging and mature brands don't know where their products are sold today, it is because existing solutions are not actionable. And while Snowrise is a strong believer in the value of Advanced analytics solutions, we understand that the fundamentals need to be in place if that value is to be realized. Snowrise performs the analytics for brands so they can quickly discover, share, and act to grow sales. We support all sales channels (ex. grocery, ecommerce, specialty) and can combine each brand's unique criteria (ex. planograms) with any data set to get actionable insights to the right team members. Our five revenue-generating analytics services, two of which were launched in 3Q22, elevate sales team performance, quantify marketing campaigns, and provide consolidated insights across all sales channels.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Commerce and Shopping, Data and Analytics, Hardware, Other, Science and Engineering, Software",2,"Dustin Mallory, Jim Haid",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
