So they did, and for the next 9 years helped many traders become financially independent and successful trading in a market neutral environment. As time passed Patrick noticed more and more algorithmic trading occurring in the equities markets, making it increasingly difficult to compete as a manual trader. He adapted to this unfair advantage over him, and in 2007 began developing quantitative algorithms to compete with the larger firms, leveling the playing field.  Patrick successfully co-founded a hedge fund in New York, where his dollar neutral, long/short trading strategy ran in full automation, and provided his investors with consistent returns.  However, he continued to ponder the unfair advantage computer driven trading had over the manual traders and investors.  He and Michelle had another idea. Why not make a retail version of their trading technology for others to benefit from?

Zidisha is based on the conviction that small-scale entrepreneurs in developing countries are capable of interacting responsibly with peer-to-peer lenders via a self-regulating web platform, without needing local intermediaries to communicate and manage loan transactions on their behalf.  Though there are other microlending websites that allow individuals to contribute funds toward microloans of their choice, all of them rely on local microfinance organizations to communicate with lenders, create loan applications and collect repayments. In these intermediated microlending platforms, the communication is all one way, so that the borrower is often unaware of the lenders who funded his or her loan. The average intermediary organization adds over 30% - sometimes as much as 100% - in fees and interest to loans raised through these websites to cover its own administrative expenses. Such high interest rates reduce borrowers' profits, sometimes to the point of making them poorer than they were before they received the loan. Unlike the postings on other microlending platforms, the loan applications and comments posted on Zidisha's loan pages are written by the borrowers themselves. This opens the way for dialogue between lenders and borrowers, so that lenders can receive answers to their inquiries about the loan and business directly from the entrepreneur they are funding. Eliminating unnecessary intermediaries also decreases cost of the loans. The average Zidisha borrower pays only about 8% (flat rate) in annual interest and fees, including interest paid out to lenders. This is far below the rates traditionally charged for microfinance loans in developing countries.  Reducing interest costs allows the entrepreneurs to keep more of their profits, so that the loans have greater impact in reducing poverty.","Community and Lifestyle, Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Other, Social Impact",1,Julia Kurnia,11-50,1,Seed,120000,USD,120000,120000,USD,120000,Y Combinator,,1,,Private,,,,,,

In 2020, Josh Pyatt and Jamie Horowitz presented Manning with a compelling pitch to start a media company. Initially hesitant, Manning recognized the potential in their proposal: the ability to run a media company from his Denver home, with the freedom to explore diverse subjects beyond football. Thus, Omaha Productions was born. Within just two and a half years, Omaha Productions has become a media powerhouse. The company produces several shows for ESPN, including the popular ""Peyton's Places"" and the highly acclaimed ""Manningcast"" - an alternate broadcast of Monday Night Football where Manning engages in real-time discussions with his brother Eli and various guests, including Barack Obama and Tom Brady. Omaha Productions also works on projects for Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, in addition to earning substantial revenue from commercials for clients such as Bush's Beans, Caesars Entertainment, and Nationwide. Omaha's growing portfolio of content has attracted attention from media investors, who recognize the potential of the company. Seeking a partner to enhance his storytelling ambitions, Manning teamed up with media investor Peter Chernin, known for his early investments in successful ventures like Hello Sunshine, Barstool Sports, and Crunchyroll. Chernin's expertise and guidance will contribute to Omaha's goal of creating inspiring and inclusive content for diverse viewers. As Omaha Productions continues to flourish, Manning relinquishes his role as the quarterback on the field to become the offensive coordinator of his expanding media empire. With a sharp focus and a commitment to quality, Manning has transitioned seamlessly into the world of media, successfully establishing Omaha Productions as a prominent player in the industry.","Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio",2,"Jamie Horowitz, Peyton Manning",11-50,1,,,USD,,,USD,,The North Road Company,1,1,,Private,,,,,,

Today, Schnitzer operates 97 recycling facilities, including seven deep water ports – on both U.S. coasts and in Hawaii and Puerto Rico – which enable efficient delivery of processed scrap metals to steel mills and foundries around the world.
