This smart sensor basketball uses its patented point-of-force technology to help athletes more rapidly develop muscle-memory. The basketball measures key motor skills, learns the strengths and weaknesses of players at any level, and adapts as the player improves.  While wearing Glass, basketball players receive visual and audio shot feedback in real time for skills including shot arc, shot release speed, and backspin.  With a range of over 100 yards, the basketball communicates with Glass via bluetooth to display key metrics necessary to build better shooting skills. The Glassware includes three key shooting analyses tools: Shot Arc Analyzer, Shot Release Speed Timer, and Shot Backspin Analyzer. The Glassware instantly overlays shooting data into the field of view for the shooter or coach, helping the user visualize the quality of each shot.  The data makes it easier for the player to adjust mechanics, improve shooting range, develop a softer shot, or simply become a better free throw shooter. It can be used by the coach watching the player, or by the player practicing on his or her own. 94Fifty has also introduced apps that are now available for Glass, iOS 7, and Android, which provides athletes the ability to share their achievements with friends, family, and coaches via social media. 4Fifty Smart Sensor Basketball is the official smart basketball of the National Association of Basketball Coaches and has been endorsed by the Amateur Athletic Union Basketball (AAU).","Apps, Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Software, Sports",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The biggest problem with online dating today is that people often misrepresent themselves in their profile. Sometimes this is unintentional; it is difficult to be objective when evaluating oneself. Other times, members use ""harmless"" white lies to seem more attractive. There is even an entire industry devoted to enhancing people's profiles to make them more attractive. Even worse, scammers and predators use online dating to take advantage of unsuspecting people. We decided there had to be a better way and we found it by going back to a method that has been around for centuries. Before online dating, people were commonly introduced through family or friends. These introductions provided a social filter; a friend that knows you offers a unique perspective about who is or isn't a good fit for you. It also keeps people honest; a married person masquerading as single is very unlikely to be recommended by his friends. We realized that that the idea of using a social context to improve the matchmaking process meshed perfectly with the rise in popularity of social networks like Facebook.  Thus, Heartbroker was born. Heartbroker's mission: to be the single best way for you to find a compatible match. These values act as guiding principles for our business: 1.Treat our users and community the way we would want to be treated. 2.Deliver a valuable service that is worth the price. 3.Respect the privacy and sensitivity of our users. 4.Life is short, so enjoy the ride.","Community and Lifestyle, Events, Internet Services",2,"Craig Robinson, Sean Silas",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
