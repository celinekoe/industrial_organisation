This is accomplished by brokering a relationship between innovators, entrepreneurs and like-minded investors for the advancement of sports around the world. LiifGroup, LLC is the first crowdfunding platform created in Minnesota.  LiifGroup believes crowdfunding is best done when it matches innovative projects tailored toward diverse marketplaces.     Liifsport focuses on projects that will connect the world’s sporting community.  Liifsport offers a unique opportunity to launch a product or service in all areas of the sports marketplace.  Minnesota is a melting pot for sports organizations and businesses.  “Everyone is affected directly or indirectly by sports, whether it’s your kids, your business, your community or maybe you’re just a sports enthusiast.  Being in the center of Minnesota will allow us to provide options for new sports technologies and products to find sufficient funding,” Erik Westrum, Co-Founder and professional hockey player.   LiifGroup, LLC is nearing completion on additional sites geared to startup businesses and charities.  LiifGroup’s goal is to spur innovation for small companies maximizing the power of the crowd utilizing our “Liifcycle” concept of idea + innovation + investing = results.  LiifGroup’s objective is to bring a simple idea to a successful reality through each of its niche market segments.  Unlike crowdfunding predecessor Kickstarter, LiifGroup’s philosophy offers innovators the option to capture any funding reached during their project.  Many crowdfunding sites offer an all-or-none format.  LiifGroup is unique in allowing innovators the option to utilize rewards and equity as part of their funding campaign. According to Forbes, the crowdfunding industry will grow from $1.5 billion in 2011 to $2.8 billion in 2012.  LiifGroup management anticipates continued growth in the area of crowdfunding and crowdsourcing as the new regulations pertaining to the JOBS Act are released later in 2013. Headquartered in Savage, LiifGroup, LLC is one of the leading newcomers in crowdfunding.","Financial Services, Sports",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

We have a collective over 50 years of gaming and media experience, and our partners come from the leading social media, gaming, and television companies both public and private.  Our expertise is in bridging the gap between traditional media properties and the multi-billion dollar gaming space, with particular emphasis on the recent boom in social and casual games and applications.  We have the ability to develop, monetize and distribute on multiple platforms and via multiple distribution fronts such as online, mobile, I-phone, etc.  Our company is currently focused on the 4D's: Design, Develop, Distribute, and Deliver as a mantra and our three key avenues of business are as follows:   1.  Software and Game Development:  We have been engaged and partnered with high profile media and brand properties to develop multi-platform gaming initiatives.  Our proprietary relationships, industry know-how and ability to tap into foreign resources allow us to develop branded games at a fraction of the cost of our competitors.  We are currently out-pacing our competition by over 70% cost savings, and we often take co-development positions putting equity into projects that make sense, and further drive down the cost to our partners.  On key targeted projects we prepare an in depth financial analysis based on aggregate industry data that often leads to development and operations cost resulting in less than 5%-10% of the overall ROI.    2.  Social Media, Gaming and Digital Distribution Transaction and Advisory Practice: As industry leading experts in the field we are often approached to advise on strategic development and transactions in the social media, distribution and gaming spaces.  Our team has the ability to handle all aspects of due diligence and strategic planning, as well as provide EIR services (Entrepreneur in Residence Services) to handle and facilitate internal operations and sales functions for key clients.  We are building a digital consulting practice that acts as a revenue generating center for key partners.    3.  Monetization of Gaming platforms for Advertisers and Brands:  Via extensive game developer relationships we have access to over 35 million monthly active users online, and our proprietary matching software and algorithms enable us to easily integrate brands and advertisers inside of today's casual and social games.  We handle all facets of the media buy and planning and offer full service integration and in certain cases monetization (via sales of virtual goods) of marketing and revenue campaigns.","Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Transportation",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

"Nano+Klevr | Mind your Mouth, Live Longer.",https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nanoklevr-capsulettes,"Beauty, Health Care, Retail","Miami, Florida, United States",A portable kit comprised of an eco-friendly and durable toothbrush plus a soft gauze 'pillow' that carries out prophylatics and diagnostics.,"3,151,935","Greater Miami Area, East Coast, Southern US",,Active,2018-04-04,day,,,,,For Profit,https://www.nanokolev.com,"Our prototyped and field-tested Nano+Klevr, is a portable kit comprised of (a) An eco-friendly, durable 'delivery' toothbrush plus  (b) A soft gauze 'pillow' embedded with dried paste or gel, and it fits right inside  Nano's bristle area. It carries out prophylactics and diagnostics such as Saliva capture, Plaque and Tartar removal, DNA testing, etc. Our kit is LMIC-friendly thanks to its very low cost, tiny size, durability (5 years!) and being Water-conscious. With the help of DayOne, WHO and NGOs, we envision being able to touch the lives of 1.000.000+ billion children in impoverished communities around the world. Since Nano, our 'delivery' toothbrush can be sterilized in boiled water, it can cost-effectively be used in hospitals, clinics and advanced Posts to 'One-Offs' brushing   kid's teeth or even capture Saliva for the early diagnosis of diseases (e.g. Diabetes). Klevr, our high-absorption sterile gauze can be used to collect up to 2 ml of fluids from the mucosa. Then, with a simple twist, the user drops the Klevr inside the glass Vial to be quickly stabilized. Did you know? Left unattended, Gingivitis may evolve to Periodontitis and trigger several health conditions such as Diabetes, Cardiovascular & Kidney mal-function, Hypertension, pregnancy complications, Dementia, to mention just a few.   Did you know? Research indicates that SCHOOL ABSENTEEISM among poor children has DENTAL PAIN as one of its reasons.  It all starts with a thin layer of PLAQUE or BIOFILM that builds up on top of the Teeth's Enamel and then solidifies thanks to minerals present in our Saliva, and becoming Tartar.  Next, Tartar will provide 'food and shelter' for bacteria colonies that produce acids which in turn, perforate the Enamel, Dentin, etc...causing Cavities. Here's an intriguing fact: all the best toothpastes and toothbrushes sold in the USA were not capable of preventing that 47% of the US population have Gingivitis (it's endemic, according to the CDC).  Last but not least, our patent-pending USPTO application reveals a unique set of longer bristles dedicated to the hard-to-reach rear-end molars. Talk to us! We are always interested in hearing potential partners and investors.","Commerce and Shopping, Consumer Goods, Health Care",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
