Points of sale include museums, bookstores, bodegas, newsstands, gift shops, hotels, street vendors and some direct Internet sales which have coincidentally been a boon for us because we've been able to react to consumer demand by updating accordingly.   UV lamination allows us to provide a durable reusable high resolution map while being ecofriendly as well. Meanwhile, where we print small batches, i.e., 30,000 maps per 3 month cycle, other map companies seek to keep wholesale prices low by printing higher volumes.  As a result they are more likely to be outdated.  This was a deliberate choice on our part in order to provide vendors faster turnaround of inventory tailored to the area or type of point of sale they require.  Our vendors tell us that this approach allows our maps to sell better while some other maps that focus on streets rather than sites or have stale information collect dust on the store shelf.  Our design and style  led to a contract with Macy's to be their exclusive designer and printer of their own maps which highlight store locations and are used as a marketing tool for the giant retailer.
