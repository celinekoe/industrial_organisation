Rootty,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rootty,"Advertising, Social Media","Earth, Texas, United States",Social network,"2,461,766",Southern US,$1M to $10M,Active,2013-08-01,day,,,,,For Profit,http://rootty.com,"Rootty is the world’s first social network where each user is its rightful shareholder. What does it mean? Since users make core asset of any online company, we are convinced that every member of the social network should personally benefit from his online membership and be able to influence company activities and decision-making. That’s exactly what Rootty offers. Rootty is a one-of-a-kind social network project co-owned by its members. • 40% of the company shares are owned by founders; • 60% of the company shares belong to users. All members joining Rootty before September 1, 2014 will be gratuitously given a share in the company and thus become its lawful voters. The dividend payments to be made by the company per each share owned will add to users’ bonuses. How do users influence the company activities? The lines of the company development will be decided by popular vote. It is users who decide where it should be going and what activities should be implemented first. Each user is able to put their ideas to popular vote. You think Rootty should be more into video broadcasting? OK, it’s great idea. Put it to vote, and if it is supported by other users it stands a chance of entering the second round of voting for the Top Ten Rootty Service Idea. The best idea selected by the voters in the second round (to be held once every 3 months) will be immediately put into practical effect and bring author sizeable reward. We are ready to pay for the ideas and will always be encouraging user participation in running the company business. How is the company profit distributed? • 40% of profit go to company development; • 40% of profit is dividends payable to users; • 5% of profit is quarterly payment to authors of best Rootty development ideas; • 15% of profit is user activity bonus (bonus points converted into real money). It’s simple mathematics: suppose the company made 100 dollars in 3 months. 40 of them will go to company development, another 40 will be distributed as user dividends, 5 dollars will be paid to authors of the best Rootty development ideas and the remaining 15 will be proportionally distributed between users based on their activity rate over the last 3 months. The company’s earnings ultimately depend you, as is everything in Rootty. How do I become a shareholder? Each member is granted a share in the company upon the online registration. 50% of Rootty shares are proportionally distributed among all the members registered. Also, we are committed to reward the users who have taken the most active participation in the foundation of the company, told their friends about Rootty and invited them to join. Therefore, another 10% of Rootty shares will be distributed among the top 10 active users, each of whom is entitled to 1% of Rootty shares. How do I become top user? All actions contributing to formation of the company will be rewarded with bonus points. The number of the points earned serves the basis for the user rating. The status of top user and 1% of shares will be assigned and granted to the users ranked, as of the date of share distribution, among the top 10 active users. The current rating will always be available in relevant section of the website. Bonus points Originally, the points system is required to maintain the user rating and identify the 10 most active users. Later, however, the points will be used as Rootty’s inhouse currency closely connected with the company’s actual bank accounts. One will be able to use bonus points to pay for outside companies’ goods and services, or convert them into real money at the current exchange rate. Subsequently, bonus points will to be awarded for users’ helpful actions, but these will no longer have any effect on each user’s rating and amount of shares. Below is what the points will be awarded for: 1 point for every hour spent online; 50 points for inviting a new user; 1 point for clicking a promo link. The shortest way to make the top ten user rating is through inviting new members. Given that users make our online company’s most valuable asset, we think it’s only fair. The ‘new members’ criteria awards more points for helpful actions and allows those who really help to outcompete those who are trying to hit the rating through merely staying online. When and how will the company shares be distributed? Rootty accounts verification procedure will start on September 1, 2014. Each registered user willing to have a share in the company will have to confirm their identity. This is a necessary condition for the shared to be granted in a legally sound manner. You can choose any name to register yourself under, or put any information to your profile, but you are required to provide true personal details for the purposes of verification procedure. The user rating and the list of the potential shareholders will be frozen during the verification procedure. The users registered after September 1, 2014 may not participate in share distribution. If the verification procedure results in less than 100 000 confirmed accounts, share distribution will have to be suspended until the required minimum is obtained, in which case the user rating will be re-activated and the list of users eligible for share distribution expanded until the 100 000 verified users requirement is met. The users registered after the company shares have been distributed may put their ideas to vote and seek Rootty best idea or ‘activity’ awards, but may not vote when deciding on Rootty’s priority activities and therefore be eligible for a share in the 40% of profit distributed as shareholder dividends. Rootty is currently operating in JSC format and has 100 shares having a nominal value of USD 1000 per share. After we have completed the verification procedure, the shares will be distributed among Rootty’s confirmed members based on their number. What are the company’s income sources? Our basic income source is placement of advertising and fee-based surveys. The bigger we are in number, the higher the income of each individual member and the share price. Later, there may appear other sources of monetization, but not at users’ expense. Under no circumstances will the company charge its users. All possible premium or extra services can be paid by users only with the bonus points or Rootty’s inhouse currency which, are awarded for activity, and may not be bought by money. Financial flows go only in the direction of the user and never back. So, what is Rootty? Although we refer to Rootty as social network, it is not really a social network. Social network is only one of the services it offers and designed to be implemented first. What we target is a ‘working platform’ offering a variety of functions pooled together in one place and made available via a most clear and easy interface. Users themselves will decide on which functions should be implemented and in which sequence. We are absolutely open to the world. Apart from novelties, we are seeking integration with the services being offered by the outside companies enjoying popularity among users. It makes no sense for us to remain close to or compete with other companies for users. Since we target to provide functionalities according to a ‘one stop shop’ principle, we realize how important the cooperation and integration with other social networks and services is.","Advertising, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Sales and Marketing",1,Roman Petrenkin,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The Council is the government’s only independent voice for women entrepreneurs. Members are prominent women business owners and leaders of women’s business organizations. NWBC is composed of 15 members who are appointed to three-year term. The National Women's Business Council was established as part of the Women's Business Ownership Act of 1988 as an advisory body of women business owners. It was asked to identify the barriers to success for women-owned businesses and report annually to the president and Congress on their findings. By the early 1990s, the Council had begun bringing together women business owners, policy makers, bankers, representatives of women's business organizations and other stakeholders to discuss potential solutions to the challenges facing women business owners, and to recommend these solutions to the president and Congress. In 1994, the Small Business Reauthorization Act changed the structure of the NWBC to its current form to include both women business owners and representatives of women's business organizations. In 1998, the law was amended to expand the Council's membership to its current 15.","Community and Lifestyle, Media and Entertainment, Other, Professional Services",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
