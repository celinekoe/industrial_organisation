Yet in the medical field, a physician treating a progressive disease often has no choice but to be reactive -- often with harmful results. Critical data on patient disease state is collected infrequently during sporadic office visits, yielding only a single data point to interpret past trends and assess long-term risk. Unlike their personal updates, continously available via sensors, GIS, and smart phone connectivity, there is no continuous stream of physiological measurement data from patients that can allow physicians to track and anticipate changes in disease status. The medical team cannot see how patient activity may be affecting disease indicators, and they can't see whether patients are even complying with drug therapy. The end result? More patient visits to the ER and doctor's office -- often when physiological damage has already been done. Injectsense: A New Paradigm for Therapy Management Injectsense enables tracking of progressive disease indicators and improved therapy management by providing continuous, clinically actionable information through an injectable ultra-miniature sensor coupled with a secure digital health platform. Their sensor, which can be delivered during a doctor's office visit, transforms the care model by enabling medical teams to track the disease at the pace of its evolution, whether months or years, receive early warning signs and provide preventive therapy. The configurable-on-demand sensor monitors patients 24/7, requires no patient lifestyle changes and reduces the need for medical office visits. More significantly, it allows physicians to establish an individual patient baseline for comparison, to receive data quickly at any time of day, to see histories and hourly dynamic disease state before irreversible damage is done, and to increase the effectiveness of drug therapy by tracking the effects of pharmaceuticals on key indicators over time.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",3,"Ariel Cao, Cenk Acar, Enrique Malaret",11-50,4,Early Stage Venture,13236021,USD,13236021,17436021,USD,17436021,"Leerink Revelation Partners, National Eye Institute",2,2,,Private,,,,,,

One of the biggest challenges for 5G mm-Wave communication is transmitter power and efficiency. In most transceiver designs, power amplifiers (PAs) dominate the overall transmitter efficiency and thermal performance. It is extremely difficult to transmit a signal efficiently over the air at mm-Wave frequencies. To solve this, we developed an ultra-efficient silicon-based power amplifier (PA) topology for 5G mmWave applications called the Dual-Drive PA. For decades, the maximum theoretical efficiency of PAs has been fixed at 78.5%, with most PAs topping out at 40% efficiency. Until now, it was thought to be theoretically impossible to increase the efficiency beyond this figure of 78.5%. Our new, patented technology increases the theoretical maximum efficiency limits of PAs beyond 78.5%; therefore, no other PA can be as efficient as our Dual-Drive PA. Our first prototype was implemented using GlobalFoundries’ 45nm CMOS SOI process and was fully tested and verified. Based on our measurements, our first prototype achieves drain efficiencies that are 20% higher than any state-of-the-art power amplifier in the mmWave frequency range.  In addition, our technology was fully verified using the new 5G NR modulation testing standards achieving Gb/s data rates at incredible high efficiency levels. Since PAs dominate the overall transmitter efficiency and thermal performance, our PA technology can be employed by base station, cellphone, and radar manufacturers (to name a few) and decrease their thermal management cost and ease their overall system requirements.","Hardware, Internet Services, Manufacturing, Mobile, Science and Engineering",1,Edgar Garay,1-10,3,Seed,4000000,USD,4000000,4000000,USD,4000000,"Squadra Ventures, Asymmetry Ventures, Helium-3 Ventures",1,3,,Private,,,,,,

A hypercloud is a 100% software configurable virtual datacenter that lives on top of physical hardware securely in your private datacenter, on the public clouds of AWS, GCE, and Azure, and on your laptop. Virtual Machines tax performance.  Containers are too new and insecure, forcing you to redesign app deployment flow. The hypercloud unit of computation is the Terminal Machine (TM, or just Terminal).  TMs are the best of both worlds: you get the security and familiarity of full operating system instances with the bare-metal speed and efficiency of containers. TMs rebalance and migrate seamlessly without reboot to maximize efficiency of your cluster.  Terminals resize from 1 CPU to 32 CPUs and 50GB of RAM when you need the power, in seconds, with no reboot. They automatically pause or shrink back down to save you money. “The software-defined data center is 10 years away,” they say. “The public cloud is too insecure,” they say. The hypercloud is the best of both worlds: you get the abstraction and power of the cloud, with the security of running everything in your own datacenter, plus the benefits of a hybrid cloud if you want both. Today. Who uses Terminal.com? Our users range from web app developers who spin up copies of their website in 5 seconds for QA and testing, to neuroscientists who analyze large FMRI datasets on computers that scale instantly, to online schools who teach people how to code using Terminal.com. RailsBridge relies on Terminal.com to teach first-time female engineers to code Ruby on Rails.  Top consultants at ZS Associates crunch numbers on our platform for data science tasks every day.  Professors at Carnegie-Mellon use Terminal.com to teach 100-student courses with no wasted effort.  Engineers across Silicon Valley know that Terminal.com is the easiest and most powerful tool for conducting coding interviews. Terminal.com provides the full suite of tools for the modern developer. How did Terminal.com start? When Varun Ganapathi’s family moved from India to Boston, Massachusetts in the 1980's, they started a small company called Terminal Exchange Systems. The company provided terminals to local companies so that they could remotely access huge, main-frame computers. Varun Ganapathi helped his father carry machines door to door, renting out both the hardware and software to local businesses. As he grew up, Varun’s commitment to computing didn’t disappear. He completed his computer science PhD at Stanford, sold over 1 million copies of his paid photography mobile app, Pro HDR, and sold his second company, Numovis, to Google. After two years as a Google Senior Research Scientist, Varun asked his father if he could use the company domain name, Terminal.com. Varun explained that he had plans for it, but this time there would be no need to carry hardware door to door. Today, Varun and his San Francisco-based team rent out browser-based virtual machines that they call Terminals to thousands of users across the globe giving them access to the infinite resources of the cloud. Users ranging from online education students to Dev-Ops professionals can now start, resize, and scale their own Terminals in a matter of seconds. Inside each Terminal, they discover an intuitive interface for creating, editing, and sharing programs. And they don’t even have to wait for them to be delivered to their door.","Apps, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Consumer Electronics, Data and Analytics, Education, Hardware, Privacy and Security, Science and Engineering, Software",4,"Danny Krause, Jeff Wu, Joseph Perla, Varun Ganapathi",11-50,1,M&A,6120718,USD,6120718,6120718,USD,6120718,,,,,Private,,,,,,
