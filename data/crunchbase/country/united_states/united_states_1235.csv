By offering its proprietary software as an intermediary between shippers and carriers, the company is able to positively impact a wide range of logistics needs. The primary software utilized by the company to achieve these goals is known as Truck Hub. Created under the direction of company founder, Luis Lopez, the transportation management system has become widely known for the manner in which it empowers customers to take control of how their assets are handled. One of the key features of the software includes real-time tracking of assets utilizing GPS coordinates and live map updates. The software also provides customers with direct access to key transportation data including pickup and drop-off times, transportation status, and more. Drivers are also able to connect with shippers through the application’s dashboard, providing them with an avenue for linking to additional details such as photos or documents associated with a shipment. The company also provides customers with access to its warehouse management system. This system taps into a network of more than 1000 warehouses across the U.S., allowing customers to select the best storage provider for their needs. Since AssetCo Freight is a neutral warehouse provider, customers are able to work with them in confidence that their goal is to find optimal storage solutions, rather than trying to poach their clients. All of the services offered by the company are priced clearly and transparently so that customers know when making a purchase how much they will be billed. This stands in sharp contrast to traditional brokers or middlemen who’ve historically maintained convoluted pricing structures that make it difficult for customers to compare costs. With AssetCo Freight, prices are always easily viewable to make comparisons quick and simple.",Transportation,1,Luis Lopez,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
