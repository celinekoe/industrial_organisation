Tusaar was established in 2009 to commercialize a metal sequestering technology developed at the University of Colorado, Boulder. The development and research have been funded by the US National Science Foundation and the US Department of Energy. Most industrial and environmental waste streams contain more than a limited number of polluting metals that need to be effectively removed before the water can be safely discharged. The vast majority of current media-based technologies target a limited number of metals and operate under strict conditions. Other separation technologies need complex systems to operate and are sensitive to various contaminants regularly found in these waters. The Tusaar technology involves the surface treatment and impregnation of granulated activated carbon with environmentally friendly organic compounds. It works in an acidic environment, targets over 40 different metals, requires minimal pre-treatment, and is simple to use. In most applications, the metals sequestered can be recovered if necessary although preliminary testing shows that metal saturated media also passes EPA mandated TCLP tests. The technology has one issued patent and two pending. It will find application in treating industrial waste and process streams, recovering/recycling rare earth & precious metals and the sequestering of actinides. The technology offers significant advantages in its ease of application, cost, and wide applicability.","Manufacturing, Natural Resources, Sustainability",1,Gautam Khanna,1-10,3,Early Stage Venture,3654929,USD,3654929,3654929,USD,3654929,,,,,Private,,,,,,

On the other hand, lemonade represents sweet and tasty drink which is loved in the U.S. Therefore, a direct translation of this clause is ""Let's make lemonade when someone hands you a trouble"". Namely, even if you face a trouble (lemon), you could try to achieve the fruit (lemonade) out of it. They love this clause. They love a positive attitude to try to convert a trouble into a success.

The behavior of sharing TV content is there, but the way of doing it is way too hard. People have to stand up in front of the screen and make photos with reflections and strange angles. But when people do go to this trouble, it creates a major problem for the media as rights holders. They lose control of their content. They lose the ability to monetize those moments. Solution: Snapscreen makes watching TV and its content socially shareable You simply open the browser (or app) on your phone, snap the TV screen (works perfectly from a long distance), that takes you to that exact moment in the broadcast/ stream, you reverse forward or backward to the moment you want to share, clip up to 30sec and share where you want all in high definition and perfect audio. The content clipped also has the ability to be top and tailed with graphics or pre/ post roll. Everything is measurable.

Long gone are the days where hype and marketing jive alone will triumph. It is now meaning and purpose that serve as the backbone of a company’s staying power and provide the strength to remain sustainable and scalable.   Fewer than  one-third of Americans trust traditional sources of wisdom: government, media, religion and big business. This trust has eroded, particularly for millennials and Gen Zs, who now represent more than half of the U.S. population. Yet, many companies that have tried hastily to capitalize on that broken trust have only broken it further with false and inflated promises.   Now more than ever, people are seeing through the hype and massive fundraising rounds and are seeking purpose and meaning when it comes to making decisions to invest in or build a business.   In response, a new generation of companies dedicated to these principles is emerging, and gaining traction. These are the billion-dollar opportunities that will fundamentally transform the way we work, live and care for ourselves and others.   TMV has assembled a team of battle-tested operators, with proven records of spotting and amplifying inventive young companies that are bringing about this change. Our Terrain Purpose-driven founders reimagining… The Way We Work: We invest in companies that help both workers and entrepreneurs cultivate talent Logistics and Mobility: We invest in companies creating transparency and efficiency around global trade and movement Sustainable Solutions: We invest in the circular economy The Care Economy: We invest in companies broadening access to care Education Tech: We invest in companies advancing education systems   Our Commitment We make investments that reflect the way the world actually looks.
