RocketShip Tours,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rocketship-tours,"Aerospace, Innovation Management, Space Travel","Phoenix, Arizona, United States",Space Tourism,"1,826,393","Greater Phoenix Area, Western US",Less than $1M,Closed,2008-01-01,year,,,,none,,http://www.rocketshiptours.com,"COMPANY RocketShip Tours is an American space tourism company founded by travel industry entrepreneur Jules Klar which plans to provide sub-orbital human spaceflights to the paying public, in partnership[1] with Rocketplane developer XCOR Aerospace. Klar created RocketShip Tours to act as General Sales Agent for XCOR Aerospace. Jules Klar got his start in the travel business in New York City in 1961. He founded $5-A-Day Tours in partnership with Arthur Frommer. Klar's company, Great American Travel became one of the most successful wholesale travel organizations in America as a result of his association with Frommer's. The company's space tourism package includes screening, training and a trip into suborbital space. Jules selected XCOR Aerospace to partner with, due to its record of reliable rocket engine development and technological approach towards suborbital space travel. SPACECRAFT  Designed and built by XCOR Aerospace, the Lynx rocketplane will have four liquid rocket engines at the rear of the fuselage burning a mixture of LOX-Kerosene and each of them will give between 2500-2900 lbf (11 120-12 900 N) of thrust.[2] The Lynx is projected to carry one pilot, a ticketed passenger, and/or a payload or small satellites above 100 km altitude. The occupants would wear pressure suits made by Orbital Outfitters.[3][4] The Lynx was initially announced on March 26, 2008, with plans for an operational vehicle within two years.[5] That date has since fallen to late 2011.[6] Mark I Prototype Maximum Altitude: 61 km (200,000 ft) Primary Internal Payload: 120 kg (265 lbs) External Dorsal Mounted Pod: 280 kg (617 lbs) Secondary payload spaces include a small area inside the cockpit behind the pilot or outside the vehicle in two areas in the aft fuselage fairing. Mark II Production Model Maximum Altitude: +100 km (+330,000 ft) Primary Internal Payload: 120 kg (265 lbs) External Dorsal Mounted Pod: 650 kg (1433 lbs) and is large enough to hold a two stage carrier to launch a microsatellite or multiple nanosatellites into low Earth orbit. Secondary payload spaces include the same as the Mark I. SPACEFLIGHT Suborbital flight tickets are now available ($95,000 per person with a $20,000 deposit).[7] The adventure begins with an initial deposit, which qualifies a passenger for a four day orientation, medical screening and G-Force training at a luxurious Arizona resort[8] supplied by RocketShip Tours. Passengers will train together with their fellow space travellers. A final payment is required to take the flight aboard the Lynx rocketplane. It is expected that the spacecraft will be piloted by Richard A. Searfoss, a retired United States Air Force colonel, NASA Astronaut and current XCOR test pilot. The craft is projected to be a one passenger, one pilot rocketplane.[9] Its planned trajectory will overlap the Earthâ€™s atmosphere at 70,000 feet (21,000 m), which will make it a sub-orbital journey with a short period of weightlessness.[10] The spacecraft, the Lynx rocketplane, is a Suborbital rocket-powered aircraft being developed by the California-based company XCOR Aeorospace. When operational, the vehicle will fly over 100 km (the KÃ¡rmÃ¡n line, a common definition of where ""space"" begins). The time from liftoff of the Lynx until the touchdown of the vehicle after the sub-orbital flight will be about 1.0 hour. The sub-orbital flight itself will only be a small fraction of that time. The weightlessness will last approximately 5 minutes. COMPETITION Besides RocketShip Tours, there are numerous other companies actively working on commercial passenger suborbital spaceflight.[11]Additionally, there are several others developing commercial manned orbital spaceflight capability (including some which are initially designed for, or may eventually be used for, commercial passenger spaceflight), which is a significantly more difficult problem than suborbital spaceflight. Currently, tickets are available through the XCOR partnership with RocketShip Tours. Priced at $95,000, they are expected to be around half the cost of those quoted by current competitors in the commercial sub-orbital spaceflight market.[7] OPERATIONS Test launches are planned to take place from the Mojave Spaceport, where XCOR Aerospace is constructing the spacecraft. RocketShip Tours expects that initial passenger flights will take place there, as well.[12] REFERENCES 1.^ XCOR Announces RocketShip Space Tourism Venture.

Rusty Squire is the founder of the Heart Rate Watch Company and was the first skier in history to ski more than 300,000 vertical feet in one day when he set a world record at Big Sky, Montana making 220 runs by helicopter to raise money for kids with cancer. Rusty is a former member of the U.S. Ski Team, a three-time NCAA All-American, and a former national caliber cyclist and triathlete. Rusty also finished second with legendary extreme skier Doug Coombs in the 1994 ESPN ""24 Hours of Aspen"" and finished 2nd in the World Iron Skier Championships. Rusty has worked on multiple feature ski films, did a ski tips segment for the Outdoor Life Network (Versus), has appeared dozens of time on ESPN, was featured in Esquire magazine, has appeared in dozens of advertisements and has appeared in dozens of other periodicals in an outdoor career spanning three decades. Rusty has also worked with and coached hundreds of aspiring athletes over the years, many who went on to successful careers in  international competition.  Our Goal Is Simple: To provide you with the highest quality customer service and to answer your questions personally, so that you get the right product that will best fit your needs. In fact, we don't outsource any customer service and most of the time when you call you'll probably get Rusty on the phone. This way you can get your questions answered in real-time by an expert who has been a world-class athlete and knows both physical conditioning and the products backwards and forwards. Too many American businesses don't feel this way about customer service - sad, but true. So, they send you to a foreign country where you get put on hold, can barely understand the other party, and when you do get a live person they perhaps are not that well versed in the topic at hand. We believe customer service starts at the top and stays there. It is a unique approach in today's cost-cutting world, but we feel the extra effort is worth it because we get to stay close to you - our valued customers. It's extra work for us but we think you are worth it!","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Sports",1,Rusty Squire,101-250,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

After two years of development and two prototypes we are at the stage of going into production and have pre-sold units. Expanded Polystyrene (EPS), commonly known as Styrofoam™, is a valuable material in the food service and other industries.  Each year tens of millions of tons are used for packaging, storing, and serving. Seventy-six (76) percent of all EPS produced ends up in a landfill. Despite its usefulness, EPS suffers from limited options for recycling.  The difficulty in recycling lies mainly in problems with transport of this valuable material. The very characteristic of light weight to volume ratio that makes EPS so useful, is its' main drawback for transport to a recycling station. StyroPower solves this problem by densifying the EPS material into a plastic block with a density of greater than 30lbs per cubic foot. The condensed block has a high energy value and can be converted into fuel, used to generate electricity, or remolded into construction material.","Manufacturing, Natural Resources, Sustainability",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

They saw a time when all content could be discovered in a multitude of ways and then accessed immediately.  They were among the first to package and sell digital music, books, newspapers and documents on the Web in 1998-99 and were voted Best New Company at Internet World that year. In 2000 a major television network utilized their pioneering technology to deliver Olympics content directly from banner ads on websites...a major leap forward. Knowing they had created some very significant technologies, the founders filed patents on their key inventions.  Now, some 12 years later, some of the largest tech companies in the world are licensees of these patents.  Many of their patents are just coming into their own due to the success of digital media and advertising.
