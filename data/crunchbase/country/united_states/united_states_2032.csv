The concept for Coaches Tribune was developed in the living room of Michele Kiernan, a successful real estate executive who is raising two sport-loving boys with her husband in northeast Ohio. She spent the evening playing in the backyard with her son, who grabbed a football and tee from the garage to practice kicking field goals. After repeated misses, her son asked what he was doing wrong. Michele is an avid football fan but never played the sport, and later in the evening began looking online for information on the correct way to kick a field goal. After 30 minutes of pouring through websites with pay walls and online videos that didn’t provide answers, she called her husband to express frustration at the lack of free, high-quality online resources in a single location. Through a collaboration with Sirocco Media, founded by longtime associate John Kueber, Michele began the process of building the framework for Coaches Tribune.","Other, Sports",1,Michele Kiernan,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
