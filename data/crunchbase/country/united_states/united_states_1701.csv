Ro had the idea to create a training journal! It was the one thing, besides her running shoes, that she couldn’t live without as an athlete. She had began the practice of logging her training as a teenager, and it coincided with the time she took ownership of her running and her performances. The practice of journaling stayed with her as she moved to the USA for college, competed in the NCAA system, internationally as a pro, and finally in the Olympics and World Championships. She also tracked her training through her pregnancies and still does in her retirement from professional racing.
