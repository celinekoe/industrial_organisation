Using the information that is broadcasted, other establishments can turn away the offender without unknowingly serving them. This is particularly useful in areas where entertainment districts exist.  The goal of this service is to cut down on the  number of drunk drivers that are a hazard to the general public, reduce the liability that bartenders and their owners are subject to on a nightly basis, and reduce the insurance liability incurred by the insurers who cover them. The company will charge a nominal monthly fee that is paid by the subscribers for the service (ie- bartenders and or their owners). A single user license, will be made available for an individual phone number subscriber, a package for 5 numbers, to cover a single business as a whole, and larger packages for small chains and larger chains alike.

The first movie is already scripted  and developed with an Academy-award winning film director attached who has production and P&A financing lined up when the fund can provide a minimum of $1,000,000 in collateral. The movie will be made for $5,000,000 and is based on a New York Times best seller.  A  faith-based film distributor has pledged to invest $5,000,000 in P&A funding to market the film nationally once the film is made.   The principals of the Good Faith Film Fund have experience producing, booking, releasing and distributing films that have achieved hundreds of millions of dollars in box office revenue and millions of units in DVD sales through major theatrical chains such as Regal, Cinemark, and AMC and big box retailers such as Wal-Mart, Costco, Barnes and Noble, and Books-A-Million.  The fund simply needs $1,000,000  that will be placed in an interest bearing bank account to collateralize a loan that will fund the production and P&A for the movie.  The interest bearing account will pay 12% annual interest on the fund to the investor with a complete return of the capital within two years but no sooner than one, at which point if not paid back in full with promised interest, the loan will convert to a percentage in the film distribution partner's successful 28-year old book publishing business that currently has $5,000,000 in annual revenues and is growing.","Content and Publishing, Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Media and Entertainment, Video",,,51-100,1,,,,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

They have a strong emphasis on online marketing ethics and a drive to constantly provide the best optimization technology. With all of their experience establishing proven media avenues they practically guarantee their affiliates the widest reach and the quickest growing Return On Investment in the industry. Adzoomer sets the Gold Standard as the Maximized Affiliate Network. As an affiliate, you will enjoy resources that other networks simply can’t provide—like ironclad privacy protection, exclusive technology solutions, the best advertiser lineup in the industry, and the highest level of personal service. That means we can include what every affiliate wants: More opportunities and higher earnings. We are successful affiliates ourselves and we understand that we grow as a network when our affiliates succeed, so we license our technology to affiliates directly. We carefully vet our affiliates because to be the best network, we can only work with the BEST of the BEST affiliates. We consider our affiliates to be our family, and work as a team. Publishers As a network, we prefer direct relationships with our advertisers in most cases. However, we understand the power and benefits of publishers who wish to broker offers—and Adzoomer can help you find and push the best offers in the business. That’s because Adzoomer develops and cultivates lucrative relationships with the biggest and best advertisers in the industry. As a publisher working with Adzoomer, you will realize the full power of those relationships through us. Offers: We work around the clock to make sure we only have the best converting offers live and make sure they are the top in the vertical. Accounting: We always pay on time. Our dedicated Payments team will work with you to ensure your satisfaction. We default to weekly payments for $300 or more, and if you’re a top publisher, we’ll pay on demand—even daily. And because we’re so confident in our advertiser relationships, we float all payments. Consultative attitude: We think outside the box, and we’ll share our ideas with you. That’s part of our relationship-building mindset—we all want to make money together. Advertisers As a network, we believe in the power of relationships with our advertisers. In almost all cases, we prefer to work directly with our advertisers rather than broker offers through other networks—even though it’s more work for us. Why? Because building relationships pays dividends down the road. Because we cut our teeth as affiliates ourselves, we know the details of this business—the secrets to high-quality traffic, the ways to motivate affiliates to work around the clock, and the technical expertise to launch our relationship quickly and effectively. Quality traffic: Because we only work with the best affiliates, our traffic is always of the highest quality. That means better leads and more conversions for your offers—and higher profits. Compliance: This is our number 1 priority, we make sure our affiliates are always aware of all the guidelines needed to run a successful campaign. Real Time Reporting: We are extremely excited to announce we are using LinkTrust, one of the most trusted real time reporting tracking platforms on the market.","Advertising, Internet Services, Sales and Marketing",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

This combination allows the user to control the cutting area of the blades, which prevents the mower from stalling, even in tall, thick grass.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Manufacturing, Software",1,Daniel C.
