With the assistance of Omega Garden they have developed a commercial approach that have deployed at their New Buffalo, Michigan location since 2012. Their business concept is to use the Volksgarden Rotary Garden units in a multi level system (referred to as a Rotary Vertical Growing Station or RVGS)  as well as a multi level tray system (referred to as a Vertical Growing Station or VGS) growing (non-GMO and organically seeded)  produce near large urban markets reusing older vacant or under utilized industrial or commercial buildings.  This approach using this technology will provide several harvests per year of sustainable vegetables grown ""extremely local"".  This approach will significantly reduce transportation and supply chain management costs and offset large quantities of carbon by locating the farm near the markets where people consume the food, versus in remote growing locations.  This approach using the Omega Garden technology uses significantly less water than conventional farming and typical hydroponic growing systems.  The Green Spirit Farms Sustainable Vertical Farm will eliminate agricultural run off and associated soil erosion impacts improving water quality by eliminating these primary sources of water pollution. They can operate sustainably 24/7 and simultaneously (at no additional cost) reduce the ""carbon footprint"" associated with traditional food supply.  Their approach eliminates unforeseen severe weather events that negatively impact yields of high value vegetable crops (suchas floods, drought and early frost) resulting in more stable production and stellar risk management - year round.  They will grow their vegetables using carbon neutral or renewable energy and offer their expertise to others who desire to have fresh, pesticide free vegetables year round.  They know this is the right approach at the right time.","Agriculture and Farming, Energy, Food and Beverage, Other, Social Impact, Sustainability",1,Milan Kluko,11-50,2,,300000,USD,300000,300000,USD,300000,Karlani Capital,,1,,Private,,,,,,

Shortly thereafter, Erick Erickson and Clayton Wagar signed on to help out and the site took off as the singular hub of conservative grassroots collaboration on the right. Today, RedState is the most widely read right of center site on Capitol Hill, is highly respected and cited in the media, and has rapidly become one of the most influential voices of the grassroots on the right. RedState’s website, managed by Editor-in-Chief Erick Erickson, is comprised of content from Erickson, several contributing editors, and RedState registered users. RedState is unique among right of center sites in that anyone can participate. Create an account and you, too, can engage in commenting and post your own user diaries. The best get voted on by the community and the best of the best get put on the front page for everyone to see. In August 2009, RedState hosted the first RedState Gathering. Held annually, the Gathering has quickly become a leading grassroots event and has featured notable speakers such as Sen. Marco Rubio, Gov. Nikki Haley, Gov. Bobby Jindal, David Limbaugh, and Liz Cheney, to name but a few. In 2011, the Gathering served as the launch pad for Gov. Rick Perry’s presidential bid. The fifth annual RedState Gathering will be held in New Orleans, August 2-3, 2013. At RedState they capture the pulse of the authentic conservative movement outside Washington, DC and across America. They do not bow to the false pieties of mass media or popular culture, rather they inform people based on the RedState mission and set of values, un-coerced by the mandates of those in opposition. RedState was the first national political site to tout and endorse Marco Rubio for his Senate bid in Florida. They put Doug Hoffman on the national conservative radar in New York. Across the country, they find grassroots candidates and work hard to get them elected.","Community and Lifestyle, Content and Publishing, Events, Government and Military, Media and Entertainment, Other",3,"Benjamin Domenech, Joshua Trevino, Michael Krempasky",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Helping home growers from seed to harvest, no matter how much they know about plants.","409,968","Greater Denver Area, Western US",,Active,2015-10-10,day,,,,,For Profit,https://growithjane.com,"Grow With Jane is a free mobile app for cannabis growers. At its core Jane is a grow journal, growers log everything they do from seed to harvest and use Jane to keep track of what they did and when. Logging everything in Jane produces what we call a Growlog, its kind of like a report of your grow, similar to what the Facebook timeline looks like with less pictures of family members and more pictures of colas. As we expand on the core, we have reminders, so people can get notifications on what to do and when, private picture so you don't mistakenly show your plants photos to your grandmother while showing her the vacations pictures. Our current mission to improve cannabis growers success, by nudging them in the right direction using insights(contextual recommendations), reminders and other features we intend to improve upon growers success, help them learn from their past mistakes. As we are approaching the release of our online version, we are about to release the fundamentals of what we believe will shape the future of cannabis growing online. With Jane we will connect cannabis growers with seed breeders and fertilizer producers, the ones we believe are the real experts in cannabis growing. Using the seeds database, we can send advice's to growers about the chosen strain and breeder, when is the expected harvest date, and plan accordingly. Perhaps this strain needs less water or it gets too massive at the colas so having a strong stem will be beneficial. Using our Fertilizer Plans, you can apply the designed calendar from the fertilizer producers to your context. If you happen to be watering every 3 days, because of the weather around you, environment temperature, light height and more, we can adapt the calendar to your needs and calculate the appropriate measures to your particular situation, improving your quality of life, helping the novice to not burn their plants or mess with the ph and assist the more advanced users to save some time. Lastly we are releasing community features so growers can share, comment and like their friends grows as well as checking up what else people are growing around the world. Soon the community will be fed with hundreds of thousands of grows from all over the world and company's(seed breeders, fertilizer producers, an more) will be able to monitor how people use their products, learn from the growers themselves, get feedback on their product and improve their offering as well as to tend to issues they may have not expected from having their products being used halfway around the globe.","Apps, Commerce and Shopping, Community and Lifestyle, Data and Analytics, Internet Services, Mobile, Software",4,"Daniel Kim, Gaston Lozano, Nicolás Botti, Roque Terrani",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
