Garage Guys is a family oriented environment with various attractions, located in North Texas. This is one of the fastest growing economic areas in America, a location which provides Garage Guys with a number of business and occupational growth advantages and developmental opportunities.   Their strategy is to combine a theme park atmosphere into an automotive industry group in order to develop unique revenue streams that are not ordinarily harnessed in a standalone approach. In all, there will be nine automotive enterprises centered at the foundation of the group (Ford dealership, restoration center, body shop, fabrication shop, machine shop, service center, salvage yard, parts store, and commercial shop) along with 11 entrainment attractions that will focus on family entertainment and recreation (including a hotel, water park, amphitheater, NHRA drag strip, Motocross track, Formula 1 track, Stock-car track, arcade, restaurants, conference building, and art gallery).  Garage Guys business approach provides us the ability to leverage discounts throughout the retail and commercial automotive services and parts industry in a way that no other business can match. The combination of their entertainment attractions, their mission, and the method in which they link their automotive ecosystem under one umbrella provides the capability of offering services and parts for 20 percent less than their competition, thereby providing a greater profit margin.   These business advantages will be outlined in their investor video, which will provide more fundamental insight on how they have created a better “mouse trap” for both the automotive and entertainment industries.","Health Care, Professional Services, Transportation",,,11-50,1,,,,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

This is no ordinary pageant!  It is a competition based on personal interviews, platform speech presentations and on-stage interviews to find a state and national spokeswoman for the disabled.  The mission of the Ms. Wheelchair America Program and the individual state programs is to provide an opportunity for women of achievement who utilize wheelchairs to successfully educate and advocate for individuals with disabilities. Through a chosen representative, Ms. Wheelchair Massachusetts educates and advocates for individuals with physical disabilities in order to influence social change for all Massachusetts residents.  Ms. Wheelchair Massachusetts carries out this mission by educating leaders and local  communities by promoting awareness, advocacy and change in public policy for individuals  with physical disabilities.  Ms. Wheelchair Massachusetts seeks to give women with physical disabilities in the  Commonwealth a forum for the promotion of the achievements as well as the needs of  mobility impaired persons. The non-profit program is staffed and coordinated by volunteers  throughout the state dedicated to increasing public awareness so that all its citizens will be  able to lead productive and meaningful lives.  Unlike traditional pageants, the Ms. Wheelchair Massachusetts Program is in no way a  beauty contest. It is instead a competition to select the most accomplished and articulate  spokesperson for the disabled in Massachusetts. The selected representative must be able to communicate both the needs and the accomplishments of her constituency to the general public, the business community and the legislature.  By her example, Ms. Wheelchair Massachusetts will showcase the talents, accomplishments and value of people with disabilities. As Ms. Wheelchair Massachusetts, her duties are numerous. Each year she will have the opportunity to travel, visiting advocacy groups, making public appearances and conducting radio, print and TV interviews in the fulfillment of her responsibilities. These include promoting awareness of the need to eliminate architectural and attitudinal barriers, informing the able-bodied public of the achievements of disabled people across Massachusetts and promoting Ms. Wheelchair America by competing in the annual Ms. Wheelchair America Pageant and by assisting in the establishment of programs in all of the states.","Community and Lifestyle, Consumer Goods, Education, Other, Social Impact",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
