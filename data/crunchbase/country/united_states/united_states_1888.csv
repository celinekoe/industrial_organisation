It has been built using big data technology which allows it to manage large amounts of devices with very high frequency sample rates.   The GroveStreams Data Analytics Platform was designed to allow IoT entrepreneurs and developers to start with small test projects and scale to capture millions of streams of data coming in from sensors, apps, and other fixed and mobile devices across the globe. Our patented Data Analytics platform gives you immediate access to your stream data, roll-up data, and up to 140 statistics per stream. It is designed as a horizontal platform to be used across all industries. We are encouraging partners to build out their applications in the verticals in which they have unique expertise.  There are six key functional areas of the platform as it relates to your IoT data. GroveStreams allows you to: 1) Collect it. Multiple data types from dozens, hundreds, or millions of locations. Point data, Fixed Interval Streams, or Random Time Streams.   2) Store it. The platform can quickly work on up over 94,000,000 data points from each stream, or three years worth of one second resolution data. 3) Analyze it. A strong analytical package allows you to derive streams from any other streams using complex expressions which may involve numbers, dates, Booleans, strings, and many of the 140 pre-calculated statistics per stream. 4) Visualize it. A robust, highly customizable dashboard technology allows you to create the visual tools you and your customers need. 5) Share it. Allows restricted or open access to your organizations and dashboards, graphical widgets can be embedded in external websites, allows embedded data in emails, SMS, HTTP calls, and other alerts. 6) Act on it. Send alerts when data is out of the ranges you set, when data does not arrive as expected, or when an event begins or ends.  Manually act on alerts or develop automatic communications with your devices. The Platform can be used globally, and was designed to allow an enthusiast, engineer, developer or product manager to quickly build, test, and scale an IoT application or idea. The Platform costs very little to use, and pricing is based upon the number of streams you have and the number of data transactions per month (collect, analyze, visualize the data). There is no sign-up fee, no annual contract, and no mandatory consulting fees. We continue to make performance enhancements to the platform, and are working with customers to identify and build application specific enhancements as needed.  Thank you for your interest in GroveStreams.","Agriculture and Farming, Data and Analytics, Internet Services",1,Mike Mills,1-10,1,Seed,500000,USD,500000,500000,USD,500000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The law firm’s consistent focus has been to provide its clients high quality legal representation that is both sensitive to the clients’ personal concerns and highly ethical in application. The law firm has further believed that providing its clients that quality legal representation for a fee, fair both to its clients and the law firm, was the appropriate business model for the law firm. The law firm believed that this business model would develop long term relationships that would benefit both its clients and the law firm. Today that philosophy continues as the business model for the law firm, as it has for over 30 years. As a result, Bourland, Wall & Wenzel has grown from three lawyers in 1983 to twenty three lawyers in 2014, with plans for further growth in the future. The law firm has seen its areas of legal practice expand from the original estate planning, tax and business planning base to include, among others, business, estate and trust litigation, health law and charitable entity law. Correspondingly, the firm has seen its client base expand from a small number of individuals and businesses in the Fort Worth area to a large number of clients, not only in the Fort Worth-Dallas metroplex but throughout Texas and the U.S. Firm Mission We Are… a group of people who are professionally and personally supportive of, dependent upon, and concerned about each other and those we serve.

FlameStower, Inc. is an energy product engineering, design, and manufacturing company that’s developed a small, portable generator to capture heat energy from campfires, cookstoves, any open flame, and convert it direct into electricity. Not a lot of energy, but the low power demands of modern devices fundamentally change global energy strategies: one of the most powerful tools the world has known – a cellphone allowing instant communication and limitless knowledge – now fits in your pocket and needs only five volts to charge.  Our first product, a “module” for thermoelectric generators, keeps people online when they’re off–grid: •	outdoor adventurers who want a light-weight, easy to use, durable power supply;  •	professional users requiring reliability over all else, no fragile parts, an ideal solution where IT lasts mere hours;  •	communities in the developing world where mobile phone use far outreaches grid availability.  Off-grid chargers are an under-served, $3+ billion global market; people need an affordable solution to bridge the “IT Divide” rapidly polarizing our world. Our design focus and materials selection are led by a push for extreme affordability - FlameStower is on track to be the lowest cost small generator in the world on a $/Wh basis, and is a prime candidate for disruptive adoption in developing communities.""","Energy, Hardware",1,Andrew Byrnes,1-10,2,,,USD,,,USD,,StartX (Stanford-StartX Fund),,1,,Private,,,,,,
