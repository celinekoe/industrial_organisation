(Novelix), is a private, La Jolla based, biotechnology company committed to developing innovative, proprietary, dermatology products with large market potential to treat serious skin diseases. The company's main focus is the development of NVX-207, a novel, topical drug candidate with the potential to revolutionize how actinic keratosis (AK) is being treated in the absence of inflammation. AK is a pre-cancerous skin condition resulting from prolonged sun exposure and is one of the the skin diseases most frequently diagnosed by US dermatologists, affecting more than 60 million Americans. In Australia, for instance, AK affects about half the population over age 50. While the overall AK market is estimated at over $2 billion in the US alone, topical therapy is used in only about 25% of patients due to limited activity (complete clearance of lesions in only about half the patients) and often severe side effects of available topical products. In spite of these deficiencies, the AK market for topical products in the US alone exceeded $450 million in 2009 growing at 22% per annum. NVX-207's patent position is strong, development timelines to human proof of concept in AK patients are short and interest in the opportunity at the proof of concept level is clear. A recent transaction demonstrates the interest in new therapies in AK markets - LEO Pharma of Denmark acquired Peplin for $287.5 million in cash to gain access to PEP005, a natural product, without composition of matter patent protection and average to low activity, in late stage development for AK. NVX-207's potential in additional large-market dermatology opportunities including genital warts, a second small molecule NCE program and a full pipeline complement the Novelix product portfolio.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",3,"Burkhard Jansen, Jeremy Teraoka, Tim Triche",11-50,1,Seed,253103,USD,253103,253103,USD,253103,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Whether your case is simple or complex, Cambridge has one of the most experienced and qualified teams to help you. Dental Implants Cambridge was an early pioneer in establishing implants as a superior, permanent, and more natural looking and feeling option for more patients. Our implant protocol is virtually painless, and results in a more convenient and affordable solution than conventional implants for most patients.  Many people who are missing teeth or are experiencing problems with their teeth can gain a full set of functioning teeth that look, feel and work like their own natural teeth. Our implant protocol also offers alternatives far superior to standard dentures – including options for those who may have been told they are not a candidate for implants at all. There are few clinics in the country that can install implants, even mini-implants, and have them ready for the patient to eat that afternoon.  With six full-time doctors, a dynamic staff and 20 treatment rooms, Cambridge is one of the largest and most up-to-date dental clinics in the country. We invest in all the most effective tools to ensure the best results for our patients, such as 3-D CAT-scans for precise analysis, planning and placement. Cambridge has a track record of superior results with fewer complications and shorter recovery periods.",Health Care,,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
