Play Across America is the solution. We help families quickly and easily find nearby playgrounds wherever they go, whether it's a new local playground, driving along a major interstate, in an airport or mall, or even on a military installation. As a military family and parents to four small children ourselves, we know what it's like when kids get restless and just need to burn off a little energy. In fact, that is precisely why we started Play Across America--we were moving from Kansas to Washington and were tired of stopping at truck stops. I asked a local about a playground when we stopped in Missoula, MT, and she directed us to the most amazing playground I'd seen up to that point--Dragon Hollow Playground. It was awesome and it was just a short drive from I-90! I knew at that moment that parents needed a national resource that could help them discover great places to play quickly and efficiently. I did a lot of research and couldn't find anything like what I wanted and started Play Across America as a hobby in August of 2012. After three years, we launched as a business in October 2015 and built out our free iPhone app and released it on March 17, 2016.

Carter was President, the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, radios blasted I Will Survive and My Sharona, everyone was talking about Kramer vs. Kramer, and seasoned sailor Anthony Sandberg had a white Dodge van and an idea: sailing was too good to be just the sport of the rich. So the man with a van borrowed a J/24, rented a shack on Alameda Estuary, and hung a shingle that read “Olympic Circle Sailing Club.” His vision was to teach sailing to students the same way he’d teach his friends. “I knew that if I had just one student, I would take such good care of them, they’d tell their friends. And that’s how they started the club,” Anthony recalls. Within a year of surviving on canned tuna and baked potatoes, Sandberg moved OCSC to an abandoned warehouse and the club had 100 members, hundreds of students, and a small fleet of Capri 14’s. Aspiring sailors were coming to him with what he recognized as cherished, closely held dreams. And to Anthony, part of respecting those dreams was democratizing what was perceived as an elitist, male-dominated sport: anyone, he reasoned, could sail, and women could skipper.","Sports, Travel and Tourism",1,Anthony Sandberg,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
