As the business grew, they looked for tools to help them scale while also reducing costs. A key area in which they could do this was merchant processing. Within the market, there was only one integrated solution with QuickBooks & QuickBooks Point of Sales, Intuit's own Merchant Services. So we decided to invest our own time, energy and money into creating an integration truly designed with the QuickBooks user and merchant in mind. We then decided to partner with Mercury Payment Systems as they provided far superior service and focused on a ""dealer centric"" model that ensured the customer was well supported. With the formal rollout in January of this year, we have seen the solution immediately embraced by other small businesses and dealers alike. Looking for a simpler and better way to work, these business found that Pensmore was a system that worked for them, not the other way around. Today, Pensmore continues to grow exponentially and continues to bring the best QuickBooks focused merchant integrations to market.

As a transactional storage engine for MySQL ClouSE opens cloud storage to SQL developers and SQL-based applications and reduces the need to retrain developers and rewrite applications to use new data processing paradigms, thus lowering the barrier for cloud storage adoption.","Information Technology, Internet Services, Software",1,Artem Livshits,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
