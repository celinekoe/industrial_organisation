The problem:  Individuals traveling in a group often encounter problems from planning the route, to keeping the group together, and communicating (in real time) within the group, while traveling.   These problems become even greater for tour operators who need to solve these challenges for both individual tours and across the multiple tours that they operate at any given time. The Solution:  Through the WolfPack’s platform users are able to organize their own groups (packs) and plan out trips (“runs”) for group travel, that are customized and fitted for their needs, travel style, etc. WolfPack provides (1) turn by turn navigation, (2) the ability to simply communicate with fellow group members (through a patent pending technology) while (3) providing a mobile geo-fence, (4) radar functionality that keeps the group together and (5) notifies travelers if they have strayed away from the group. WolfPack is further unique as it collects and tracks users’ behavior during the “best time of their lives” while traveling, enjoying the outdoors and creating great experiences. This allows us to collect and bring big data to the Travel / tourism industry that is unique to us and that is not available through any other system.

We are building, where few exist today, an ecosystem that modernizes the capital markets using blockchain-digital-ledger technology and smart contracts via our own Digital Investment Bank and Capital Markets Firm.

Very little was being done to study these diseases or develop treatments. Leaders of several rare disease patient organizations formed an ad hoc coalition to focus attention on this problem. That coalition became NORD and was instrument in the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, which created financial incentives for the development of treatments for rare diseases. Since then, NORD has served as the hub of the rare disease community, leading efforts to connect patients and patient organizations with other stakeholders and driving progress for all.  View the timeline below of highlights through the years. For many years, people with rare diseases walked alone. Patients and their families coped with daunting medical and financial issues with few resources and no one to guide the way. Then, a small group of patient advocates formed a coalition to unify this community and mobilize support to pass the Orphan Drug Act.  In 1983, the coalition became NORD, the National Organization for Rare Disorders. For more than 30 years, NORD has led the way in voicing the needs of the rare disease community, driving supportive policies, advancing medical research, and providing patient and family services for those who need them most.  Read the full story of NORD and the rare disease movement here. NORD, a 501(c)(3) organization, is a patient advocacy organization dedicated to individuals with rare diseases and the organizations that serve them.  NORD, along with its more than 230 patient organization members,  is committed to the identification, treatment, and cure of rare disorders through programs of education, advocacy, research, and patient services.",Health Care,1,Abbey Meyers,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
