While most existing BI / analytics platforms are typically used by corporate managers to gain visibility into business unit performance, they are often limited in their ability to provide visibility beyond the channel partner or distributor level (e.g., national or regional dealer). They are further limited in their ability to provide tools to influence or motivate performance at the individual salesperson level (e.g., sales associate at dealer). ThinkSmart’s unique analytics and reporting capabilities allow its clients to track real-time sales data at point-of-sale (POS) / individual salesperson level, and standardize the use and analysis of that data by various constituents across an entire organization. ThinkSmart also provides employee management and communication tools to track and incentivize sales performance at the individual level. The Company’s platform is especially vital for large organizations with disparate sales channels or distribution partners where access to end customer data can be challenging.

The main staple of the Pokémon video game series revolves around the catching and battling of Pokémon. Starting with a starter Pokémon, the player can catch wild Pokémon by weakening them and catching them with Poké Balls. Conversely, they can choose to defeat them in battle in order to gain experience for their Pokémon, raising their levels and teaching them new moves. Certain Pokémon can evolve into more powerful forms by raising their levels or using certain items. Throughout the game, players will have to battle other trainers in order to progress, with the main goal of defeating various Gym Leaders and earning the right to become a tournament champion. Subsequent games in the series have introduced various side games and side quests, including the Battle Frontiers that display unique battle types and the Pokémon Contests where visual appearance is put on display.

(DUNS # 074595993) was founded in March 2019 and is dedicated to developing launch solutions and products for the nanosatellite industry. Our business strategy relies on three core components (launch services, cubesat hardware and software) which allow us to provide a true turnkey, end-to-end space utilization solution. Realization of our vision relies on successful development of the Helios cubesat-class launch vehicle. The Helios nanolaunch system is a three-stage vertical launch vehicle with liquid propulsion in the first two stages and a solid propellant third stage. The design utilizes common propellants in the first two stages and a common engine design with nozzles optimized for altitude in a “plug cluster” aerospike configuration. Phoenix utilizes a unique hydrogen peroxide-based hypergolic propellant that eliminates the need for a separate ignition system but also is non-toxic, non-carcinogenic and the exhaust products are environmentally-friendly. This propellant family was fully developed and hot-fire qualified by Aphelion Orbitals, Inc. in 2018. We further matured the technology into Aphelion Aerospace's proprietary propellant mixture. The first stage is designed to be reusable using boostback, powered descent and vertical landing. Helios will be completely mobile and not rely on any fixed infrastructure, launch pad or processing facilities. The vehicle will be able to remain fully fueled for hours to days before launch and launch on short notice (2-3 days) after arrival at the launch site. Our launch service provides a number of key competencies: dedicated launch, custom orbital insertion, low cost, and a very short lead time. We target the following use customer types: * Commercial customers desiring rapid, guaranteed launch * Clients requiring a method of deployment and maintaining large nanosatellite constellations for communications, resource identification, and monitoring * Missions demanding specific orbits inaccessible through rideshare * Time-sensitive missions which require quick turnaround to launch * Spacecraft that need to be powered on and/or monitored real-time before deployment * Clients desiring to launch spacecraft with irregular volume and mass envelopes Aphelion Aerospace pursues an innovative launch service business model: * Our launch services are sold in a manner similar to airline ticketing * Regularly scheduled launches are provided to defined orbital inclinations * 30 days from cubesat acceptance to launch * “Gas and go” on-demand capability for dedicated launches on short notice * Full up-front price disclosure and guaranteed","Science and Engineering, Transportation",2,"Matthew Travis, Miguel Ayala",1-10,2,,150000,USD,150000,150000,USD,150000,Seldor Capital,,1,,Private,,,,,,

Misconceptions about the role of risk management, and how to accomplish it effectively, have resulted in countless organizations falling victim to preventable disasters. Preventable, that is, if only those companies had established an effective ERM program.   In 2005, LogicManager CEO, Steven Minsky, recognized the opportunity for organizations to adopt a risk based approach. Risk was the driver – the common factor – between all governance functions, so how could embracing it not result in huge gains in efficiency, productivity, and ultimately bottom line value?   Building on years of experience in risk and business process management at leading technology firms like Apple, Steven founded LogicManager, and built the LogicManager platform on patent-pending Taxonomy technology; designed to revolutionize how organization’s approached risk management.   Since 2005, LogicManager’s risk management platform and mentoring services has provided a foundation for ERM programs to thousands of organizations worldwide. LogicManager’s success is built on three core values: customer satisfaction, risk management expertise, and cost effective innovation. Their software-as-a-service package is easy to adopt and allows for very quick implementations. Access can be granted in as little as one business day, and full-business implementation takes less than 90 days, guaranteed.  Their multi-tenant structure also fuels improvement; the platform is constantly honed by feedback from customers just like yourself. It’s the users themselves that drive its evolution. LogicManager’s architecture also facilitates, and even encourages, customization. You can more easily and cheaply customize the tool than you can other hosted cloud or on-premise solutions. In fact, customizations don’t cost anything at all — you’ll never pay beyond your base subscription. Tailor the platform to your needs, no matter how specific. Your business analysts won’t need to go to the development team to write new code, because “customizations” are really configurations. This drastically reduces the likelihood of downtime due to broken code.","Financial Services, Internet Services, Professional Services, Software",1,Steven Minsky,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

4INFO,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/4info,"Ad Targeting, Advertising, Big Data, Data Management, Marketing Automation, Mobile Advertising","San Jose, California, United States","4INFO is an identity and media solutions company, solving the digital and TV convergence.","125,681","San Francisco Bay Area, Silicon Valley, West Coast",$1M to $10M,Closed,2004-09-08,day,2020-01-02,day,,none,For Profit,http://www.4info.com,"4INFO is a fast-growing American mobile technology company solving the mobile attribution challenge for national brand advertisers to measure the ROI that matters most: sales lift at the cash register. 4INFO provides audience targeting solutions to publishers, agencies, and brands, 1:1 targeting across multiple screens, including PC and laptops, and patented household ID technology—Bullseye ID—ties 152 million mobile devices and 300 million PCs to 101 million U.S. households, or nearly 100% of the U.S. smartphone user population. Their technology sees more than 120 billion ad requests monthly. The AdHaven Platform enables 1-to1 precision targeting and measurement at scale, with no limitations, the same precision as online and direct mail advertising. At the center of the AdHaven Platform are a next-generation mobile ad server, an audience and data management platform, plus an analytics platform that combine to deliver advanced targeting and ROI. Patent Nos. 8,792,909 and 8,880,097 from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office protect the technology at the core of the AdHaven Bullseye platform. 4INFO self-imposes a rigorous process to ensure the data it gathers, shares and uses to aim mobile ads at consumers is protected and near-impossible to connect to an individual. In doing so, the company incorporated privacy-by-design, a practice oft-discussed in privacy circles yet new if not unknown to most marketers. 4INFO spends at least 30% more to store data in a way that helps prevent privacy infringements than it would cost if it stowed its data in a less-secure manner. That means spreading data points associated with a specific user ID across several servers located in multiple physical locations so it cannot be compiled easily into one user profile by outside systems or hackers. In addition, AdHaven partners with the world’s leading data providers, inventory exchanges and ad sources to bridge the gap between mobile inventory and online advertising spend. 4INFO’s partnership with Acxiom allows 4INFO to offer Acxiom data within the AdHaven Bullseye product, providing direct 1:1 matches with consumer data within financial services, retail and automotive sectors. Through partnership with Datalogix, 4INFO AdHaven Bullseye can target mobile advertising on over 500 Datalogix segments, including demographic, finance, lifestyles, philanthropy, retail, seasonal, subscription services, television viewing habits and custom segments. Through partnership with Nielsen, 4INFO is able to offer Nielsen segmentation solutions, including ConneXions®, P$YCLE® and PRIZM®. ConneXions® provides consumer segments based on the combination of technology adoption, age and family structure. Nielsen P$YCLE® enables advertisers to target segments based on income producing assets and a wide variety of financial and investment behaviors. Nielsen PRIZM® provides segments based on consumer product consumption, lifestyles and purchase behaviors. 4INFO uses Nielsen Buyer Insights to directly measure the sales impact of mobile advertising campaigns, incorporating Nielsen data into the newest option within its TruView measurement platform. TruView solves a problem advertisers commonly struggle with – to measure the sales impact of their mobile advertising campaigns while sourcing sales data from hundreds or thousands of retail locations, as well as via e-commerce and m-commerce. In addition to leveraging 4INFO’s mobile technology, this TruView option enables advertisers to measure sales connected to media exposure without requiring the advertiser to provide transaction data. Through partnership with BrightRoll, 4INFO AdHaven Bullseye can target video advertising reaching audiences across web, mobile, and connected TV. In 2015, 4INFO and DMG Solutions announced a strategic alliance creating solutions to change the way marketers approach Multicultural Marketing in the United States and target specific audiences. A privately held company, 4INFO’s brand ad revenue has tripled consecutively since 2012 — and continues to experience exponential growth. Leading brands — including 8 of the top 10 largest CPG companies, 6 of the 10 largest retailers, and 5 of the largest auto manufacturers — rely on 4INFO’s scale and experience to deliver their mobile and cross-channel campaigns. 4INFO collaborates with trusted 3rd party data providers of purchase and lifestyle data — including Acxiom, Experian, Nielsen, and Nielsen Catalina Solutions.

It is the first company of its kind to provide enterprise-grade security to hybrid HTML5 Cordova mobile apps with such astonishingly fast deployment. The Appmobi Secure Mobile Platform consists of five core services: Appmobi Security Kit, Secure Push Messaging, Secure Live Update, Secure Analytics and Secure Data Store. The platform easily integrates and works with a developer’s existing development tools, providing the mobile services required to build truly secure hybrid apps in an easy-to-install package – all hosted on an enterprise’s private cloud or on premise.  Originally founded in April 2006, the Appmobi Software Development Kit (SDK) was acquired by Intel® in February 2013. The transferred technology now forms the basis of the Intel® XDK, which allows developers to build optimized HTML5 applications for mobile platforms. Appmobi maintains a partnership with Intel® that makes the Appmobi Secure Mobile Platform available to Intel® XDK developers, enabling the development of secure mobile apps via Intel’s best-in-class HTML development environment.  Based in San Francisco and Poughkeepsie, NY, Appmobi is a privately held company backed by Aspire Ventures.  Appmobi History: In 2007 Appmobi was the developer of the most popular streaming media web app on the iPhone - FlyTunes.fm. In the following years, Appmobi was also a leading provider of streaming media technology, including cross-platform apps, to the largest US radio broadcasters. In August 2011, Appmobi made available the Appmobi XDK (cross platform development kit) which allowed developers to use HTML5 technology to create fully functional mobile apps that run across different hardware platforms, including Android and iOs. Additionally, the XDK  rendered the exact same code as a 'web app' or an 'enhanced' web app that performs exactly the same as a native app.    In December, 2011, Appmobi released its directCanvas technology as open source. directCanvas speeds HTML5 game screen rendering by as much as 18x, delivering ""native"" game performance to games written with HTML5. Also in December, ReadWrite named Appmobi as the ""Most Promising Company for 2012"".  March 12, 2012, Appmobi released version 1.0 of jqMobi, an open source,  jQuery-like JavaScript framework that is highly optimized for delivering an identical user experience on Android and iOS HTML5 mobile apps.  On Feb 21, 2013, Appmobi announced to its developers that all of its HTML5 development tools had been acquired by Intel, leaving appMobi as a ""pure play"" mobile cloud services provider. In late 2013, Appmobi joined Aspire Ventures and continued with a set of cloud services for SMEs. In January 2015, Appmobi pivoted and began development of an enterprise product - the Appmobi Secure Mobile Platform - which launched in early November 2015.","Mobile, Platforms, Privacy and Security, Software",1,Essam Abadir,11-50,4,M&A,9402703,USD,9402703,9402703,USD,9402703,"Angel's Lancaster Angel Network, Investment Circle of York",,2,1,Private,,,,,,
