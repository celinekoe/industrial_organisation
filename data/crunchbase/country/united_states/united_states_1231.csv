Eye strain, headaches, blurred vision, and dry eyes are all symptoms of computer vision syndrome, which is caused by prolonged computer use. Computer vision syndrome can be caused by uncorrected visual issues such as farsightedness, astigmatism, or presbyopia. Astigmatism that isn't too severe can usually be remedied using glasses, contact lenses, or refractive surgery. Eye injury, surgery, or keratoconus are the most common causes of irregular astigmatism.

The web service allows users to have an online chat and use a task manager or note taker application at the same time.  User Story: Situation (This happened really) A biking group (motorcyclists) were planning a road trip across 4000 miles to the Himalayas. Trips such as these require intense planning before the day of departure. There were more than 25 members in the group. They had a 2 month pre-departure plan to be executed that included preparing a requirement list , setting tasks & deadlines, delegating responsibility , follow-up and review of progress, revising deadlines & tasks on a daily basis for a period of 2 months.  Problem Statement  All the members were employed in different companies. It was difficult for the group to meet on a daily basis and review progress. They needed a platform that will allow them communicate as a group and do these things together. A platform that will allow them to jointly prepare requirement sheets, task lists, delegate responsibility and deadlines and review progress. The samepage solution The same page platform was used extensively by the group for this purpose. The group chat along with the Note-taker and the Task manager application ensured that every single member of the group were in the same page literally. Nothing was missed. In fact productivity improved.
