They spend tons of time applying for positions they will never be hired for. The reason is that the majority of companies don't consider foreign candidates. But there is no way to know it in advance. To help job seekers multiple their chances to be hired abroad, we created a database of companies that accept workers from foreign countries, sponsor their visas, and provide support in obtaining work visas and permits. All the candidate needs is to pay for a subscription that grants full access to the list of 10 thousand companies and a hundred thousand open positions in 40 countries, including the USA and Canada, the UK, Sweden, Norway, and others. Each of them is hand-picked and verified by our team. We regularly update our records and remove closed positions. We also help subscribers increase their chances of getting a job by guiding them in how to build a resume and prepare for an interview. We return money in case the visa rejection. We launched the MVP five months ago, targeting job seekers from Eastern Europe, and met a great demand. We got about 60,000 visits and reached a 10% signeup to paid subscriber conversion rate. Our next stage is launching the service in India, where about 18 million people search for jobs abroad yearly, and most speak English. We're planning to launch the English version of the product this year. We also see a lot of potential in Bangladesh, the Philippines, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Mexico, Brazil, and other markets. Years of the pandemic revealed the acute need for foreign human resources in developed economies. Many industries suffer from a shortage of workers, and companies are happy to accept foreign employees. In the USA, for example, there were 10 million unfilled jobs in 2021, and only 8.4 million workers were looking for new opportunities. This not going to change for the better. The developed economies will need more and more workers from abroad, and the candidates from developing countries will continue to look for a better life there. We are a team of 6 professionals with experience in web development, database building, marketing, design and project management. We are seeking 450,000 euros for 10% of our company. The money will allow us to launch in India and get to other markets faster.
