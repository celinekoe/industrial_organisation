From the beginning, it was a clearinghouse for the gathering and dissemination of positive news stories from around the globe. Since 2006 their daily dose of ‘News to Enthuse’ has confirmed for thousands of fans what they already knew to be true — that good news itself is not in short supply; the broadcasting of it is. Thomas Jefferson said the job of journalists was to portray accurately what was happening in society. The Good News Network was founded because the media was failing to report on the positive. In the 1990’s while homicide rates in the U.S. plummeted by 42 percent, television news coverage of murders surged more than 700 percent, according to the Center for Media and Public Affairs. The editor Norman Cousins once said, “If news is not really news unless it is bad news, it may be difficult to claim they are an informed nation.”","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment, Other, Social Impact, Video",1,Geri Weis-Corbley,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Founded in 2008 by successful entrepreneur Darrin Ginsberg who built several national Independent Sales Organizations (ISOs), Super G’s lending strategy is based upon years of working with businesses that are either constrained by traditional commercial institutions or simply do not have access. Based on its 5 year performance with minimal bad debt, Super G raised a committed fund to expand its team of professionals, increase check sizes to be able to invest up to $5 mm per deal and scale its residual based loan strategy to additional markets. Super G Funding is a pioneer and market leader in residual loans to a variety of industries such as merchant services, ATM, insurance brokers and Software as a Service (SaaS) providers. Super G is the most active lender in the merchant services space as residual streams are typically not traditionally considered an eligible asset by traditional financing sources. Its lending program enables companies with a recurring monthly residual or commissions to borrow against the life-time value of that cash stream. Super G’s success in working with ISOs led to the creation of its direct lending unit due to the national network of agents that serves as a proprietary deal platform.","Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Software",1,Darrin Ginsberg,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

It operated very similar to the Downtowners Association and the Chamber of Commerce. In the early 1900’s this group of businessmen recognized that the city was growing and that to be successful, more of their sales had to be done with the use of consumer credit. At the time, credit was only extended to consumers that the retailer or lending institution had personal knowledge of the consumers family and that family’s financial condition. It should also be recognized that prior to this consumer credit was limited to the corner grocery store and the banking industry.","Administrative Services, Financial Services, Lending and Investments",,,101-250,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

In the early days, the desktop version of the software was on the forefront of database marketing and management for the remodeling industry. With each version, the software’s technology and functionality were enhanced and upgraded. They knew that web-based technology was the future and got to work creating an online solution for remodelers that retained the industry-specific features their customers relied on, yet would fully automate their business practices of generating leads, coordinating team efforts, and monitoring results. It was a complete redesign which used the latest technology, hundreds of insightful customer suggestions, and a true sense of innovation. And after years of research and development, MarketSharp now provides a complete “front-to-back” solution that provides business owners and their team every key element required to run an extremely profitable remodeling business.

SubItUp is a web based employee scheduling tool that can execute tasks as simple as creating a single shift on one day, to automatically generating multiple shifts for weeks. The program is capable of helping managers control labor costs to meet budgets and labor laws. It also keeps management connected to employees with department-wide email and text applications, messaging tools, and moderated shift change requests. SubItUp helps pick up on employee schedule trends and activities so that managers can maximize scheduling efficiency across every department within any shift-based business. SubItUp is a Manchester, NH based startup that is revolutionizing how employee scheduling is accomplished. Starting with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), SubItUp has implemented a scheduling tool that allows users to create a single shift, or automatically generate shifts weeks in advance. These options open time for managers to focus on more efficient operations instead of scheduling. Communication Simplified The program also acts as a communication tool, notifying employees of schedule updates instantly via text message, email or both. The messaging tools allow managers to schedule their messages for later dates or send immediately, making it perfect for communicating meetings or special events. Managers Lives Made Easy On the operations side, SubItUp also comes with a labor cost reporting tool which will allow managers to predict labor requirements based on past trends. It is also very useful in helping managers meet labor budgets set by the company. With the employee history tool, managers can also pick up on employee trends, allowing them to offer more targeted shifts for employees that seem to request the same shifts off each month. Happy Employees = Happy Customers On the employee side of scheduling, SubItUp makes swapping, adding and dropping shifts easier than ever. Instant notifications are sent from SubItUp to employees when an employee requests a swap or drop of shifts.  All employee activities are held in moderation, meaning managers have the ability to approve or deny all add, drop and swap requests. A cost and time effective alternative to manual scheduling, SubItUp can make a difference for managers in almost every shift-based industry.",Software,1,Bob Cote,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
