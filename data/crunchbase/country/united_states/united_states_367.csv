We decided to establish IntPicks.com back in 2008, worked on refining our methodology to adjust to a larger number of picks a site like this will require, hired the best talent we can find, and relentlessly tested our process over and over for about 3 years. We started our official website operations and opened our doors to the masses at the beginning of the 2012-13 Football season. Every single pick we released since late August 2012 is transparently displayed on our records page. Our popularity grew worldwide as the word got around.

The number of simulations was also increased to 50,000 with this update. Our current process of picking consistent winners starts out with compiling all available data points we possibly can, running at least 50,000 simulations for each game, and identifying the games where the bettor has an advantage with the given lines.
