Founded in 2012 by media veterans, Paul Calento, Miles Dennison and Michael Sullivan, TriVu Media utilizes its innovative video-level advertising information to improve the value of brand campaigns, with broadcast-style outcomes (i.e. buy video advertising like TV). The company aims to double the size of the video advertising market within two years, by providing TV-style content transparency to connected TVs, computers and mobile devices.  Content-Qualified Video Advertising: TriVu Media's pre-bid system, called TVm, matches up billions of video advertising opportunities for auction/sale on various exchanges and demand-side platforms, with highly detailed information about the actual video. Data provided includes position and content detail, down to the video level, which is not consistently available on other platforms. Customer-driven advertising programs: Using TriVu Media can implement their own buy-side strategies, such as reaching “active moms” or “male, zombie-loving millennials,” to effectively create their own video network, with full transparency, including the ability to see video-level information before the buy occurs, in order to determine what to buy and for how much. The system is data/source/partner agnostic, allowing an advertiser to get a consolidated view of inventory across multiple outlets simultaneously, and is already in use by several customers and DSPs. Additional information: TriVu Media's TVm index provides source-independent, pre-bid visibility into: video advertising opportunity type (within player or rich media ad unit); player size; required viewer engagement (auto-play or click-to-play); ad clutter (number of calls and related ads within the video); and detailed content information. There are over 65,530 combinations of selects available with pre-built optimizations for segments such as Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG); regional and national automotive advertising; shelter; and entertainment categories. Data can be viewed by the advertiser directly and transacted upon using an existing trading desk, DSP partner or via the TriVu Media professional services team. More information is available at: http://TriVu.tv and on Twitter at @TriVuMedia.","Advertising, Sales and Marketing",,,,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
