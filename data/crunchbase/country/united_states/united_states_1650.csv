Therefore, the objective behind this application is to promote discussion and encourage productive conversation that sometimes gets overlooked. Users are able to register under an anonymous name and pose questions to the platform. These questions can range from topics about internship opportunities to relationship advice.

However, the primary function of shoes is to protect and comfort individuals.  People do not want to give up style for functionality or vice versa.   Slips and falls lead to nearly 25,000 fatalities and even more injuries per year according to the National Safety Council.       We are introducing this technology to the public since people should not be slipping while performing an everyday activity such as commuting. In the workers’ shoe market, it is a necessity to wear non-slip shoes that improve friction on slippery surfaces to maximize their safety.   However, only 3% of the public is aware of this technology according to a published market research.  We developed with a partner an outsole that increases friction not only on water and oil, but also on ice and snow. My Cornell classmate and I designed stylish and classic shoes combined with this patented technology that can be worn everyday for all purposes. We want everyone to enjoy the benefits of this technology without compromising style.

An EQAL media property is a multiplatform digital magazine that creates a seamless experience for fans across various devices and social networks. With more than 40 media properties, EQAL's award-winning Media Networks include Jennifer Lopez.com; Bethenny.com; Elizabeth Banks.com; ToriSpelling.com; Lauren Conrad.com; Alicia Silverstone's TheKindLife.com; Derek Hough.com; YouTube phenoms ElleandBlair.com and Michelle Phan.com; WalkWithWalgreens.com, KRAFT's Effie Award winning RealWomenofPhiladelphia.com and others. The growing EQAL network reaches more than 60 million trend-setting consumers and generates billions of content impressions every month. EQAL Media Studios produces the portfolio of content for the YouTube Original fashion & beauty channel u look haute. EQAL was founded by online programming pioneers Miles Beckett and Greg Goodfried who created many of the ""firsts"" in the development of the online video industry with lonelygirl15, KateModern and Harpers Globe. EQAL's pop culture-obsessed teams of editors; writers, designers and social media experts create multiplatform media properties in partnership with familiar personalities and brands across numerous verticals.  Umbrella is our proprietary social publishing platform that powers our network of highly interactive social websites and mobile apps. The core platform is an API that integrates dozens of third-party API's, including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Foursquare, Instagram and more. Because Umbrella websites and applications are connected via API's to popular social networks like Facebook and Twitter, our media properties are ""service and device agnostic,"" making it easy for fans to interact with the property on their favorite social network using their preferred device.  The Umbrella platform consists of a web-services application and RESTful API that provides a generic interface for dozens of third-party social API's. Applications built on top of the Umbrella API can seamlessly read-write data across multiple services with fewer API calls and lower overhead. The platform includes a content management system and a mobile publishing application, and provides a framework for future application development including mobile consumer apps, connected-television apps, and more.   Our innovative ""sponsored post"" ad unit is integrated into the feed of content on the homepage of our celebrity websites and syndicated to social networks like Facebook and Twitter. Because the ads are shareable, like-able, and incorporate discounts and giveaways, they drive high levels of engagement and ROI. Leveraging our branded content team, brand advertisers can directly work with our celebrity partners to create an on-site ""celebrity campaign"" or a micro-site ""branded community."" EQAL's worked with the biggest brands on earth, including Kraft, Walgreens, Avon, Clorox and more, and set the bar for social media advertising with the 2011 Effie award-winning Real Women of Philadelphia campaign. The leadership team includes technology and creative executives from CAA, Disney, E! Entertainment, Firstborn, McKinsey, Trailer Park, MTV, FUSE TV, Idealab, and Amazon.

Set standards of substance. We will not participate in the dilution of what it means to be paleo. We have set our own strict ingredient guidelines based upon unbiased scientific research** and also work closely with groups such as the Paleo Foundation to help identify products that meet our standards. Food vendors are already beginning to flood the marketplace with sub-par, so-called “paleo compliant” products. We hope that in time, our policies will help these well-meaning but misguided food companies create acceptable, high quality products. If everyone maintains high standards, the fledgling paleo movement can avoid being co-opted by corporate interests, in contrast to what has happened to the organic food industry. Spread awareness of the important health related issues of our time via blog entries, a newsletter, conference sponsorships, our books department and the resources section of our website. Enable you to make informed decisions via a web site that prioritizes content over marketing. All of our products' ingredients and nutrition facts are easy to find. Additionally, we're building a powerful advanced search engine with which you can query products by their nutrients, ingredients, certifications, etc. and sort search results by important factors such as carbohydrate content. We invite you to join us in our mission by shifting your grocery purchases wherever possible from corporate, profit-focused, GMO-supporting “natural foods” stores to shops such as ours.

Currently, the standard for people seeking employment or a way to connect with colleagues is to create a LinkedIn profile. The unfortunate reality, however, is that these profiles are sold to third parties and also have their public data scraped by advertisers and other nefarious groups. Many LinkedIn users also admit to proactively adding people they do not have a real relationship with, contributing to the rampant depersonalization social media is known for. And on the job recruiter’s end, the profiles they buy access to are often inactive or untruthful, effectively making the hiring process a cost center for the business.  MBYS offers a solution to both reward users for the professional data they produce, and also gives companies an inexpensive tool for recruiting verified talent, all the while keeping the user’s data private and out of the hands of third parties. Users stake their MESH tokens on validating profiles of members of their network, and companies use MBYS tokens to purchase profile data directly from users. Our mission is to build a decentralized professional network that gives users complete control over their data, and incentivizes them to grow and maintain their networks, and get hired.","Apps, Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Community and Lifestyle, Financial Services, Internet Services, Mobile, Other, Payments, Professional Services, Software",2,"Mbys Operations, Omar Zaki",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
