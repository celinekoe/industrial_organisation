The mission is to combine high tech with hustle to create personal connections between employers and vets through a video interview and job matching site.  Since small businesses are the back bone of the American economy why wouldn't you want America's proven talent helping grow your company?  Never hired a Vet? No problem, simply post a job along with a few questions and wait for 30 second videos accompanied by resumes translated into business speak to pour into your account.  These quick, candid, and pre-record videos allow you to check out vets on your own time and on your own terms.  When you find someone you like it is easy to invite them to a quick call, live video interview, or bring them in to your place for a traditional interview.  And, if you are not sure what you are looking for we developed ""Command Search"" a netflix type tool, that learns your preferences and gets you to the right candidate immediately.  Command Search gets smarter every time you use it so your time on VetCommander is well spent and gets you back to growing your business quickly. Veterans will love using VetCommander because we listened to what you didn't like about everything else out there.  We got rid of the black hole of resumes by providing built in feedback that automatically tracks your resume and generates a report based on how employers interact with your application.  So, whether an employer never looks at it , checks it out and then drop off, or falls in love with it, you will know the moment they click on it.  It's almost like big brother is looking out for you, expect both parties know what's up. Finally, we tie the whole thing together by bringing in veteran advocate groups to support our vets from mock interview to hiring and beyond.  The VetCommander Dashboard was designed so veteran advocates can engage with younger vets and provide support.  When a vet creates a profile on VetCommander they can select a veteran advocate group like the VFW or American Legion to represent them.  These advocates can help with everything from employment to housing and veteran benefits.   In short, VetCommander Dashboard makes it easy for everyone to do what they love.  Vets get to check out great job opportunities knowing that they have someone looking out for them in other areas.  Employers get to hire great vets knowing they have an entire community behind them and advocates get to reach out and serve a new and younger audience.  VetCommander just might have the power to re-ignite the entrepreneurial spirit of America by engaging veterans to grow America's best small businesses.  We hope you will join us in our mission of Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Awesome Jobs.","Administrative Services, Apps, Media and Entertainment, Mobile, Software, Video",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Their goal with Wondering Sound isn’t to sell music, but to share it, regardless of what label it’s on, if it’s available digitally, or if fewer than 50 people have even heard of it. We’ll cover things because they think they’re interesting and worth knowing about — whether it’s an in-depth piece on the anniversary of a groundbreaking jazz record, or a profile of a kid making brain-rattling music in his bedroom with a thrift store keyboard and a four-track. Their  entire ethos is right there in their name, which was taken from a song by Family Band: they are thinking about music, and they are putting an emphasis on artists who are doing the same — artists who are fascinated with the possibilities of sound, who have a distinct, singular, uncompromising point-of-view and who are dedicated to testing the boundaries of what’s been done before. Just as important as the music, though, is their high-caliber roster of writers. They have been privileged to work with some of the best writers in the business. Justin Davidson, who writes about classical music for us, is a Pulitzer Prize-winner. Kevin Whitehead, their jazz writer, is a regular contributor to NPR’s “Fresh Air.” John Morthland was there during the early days of Creem and Rolling Stone, an era that’s now venerated among music fans as the golden age of music journalism. To go name by name through their list of contributors is to be faced with a veritable who’s-who of music journalism. The same people who write for us contribute to the New York Times, Pitchfork, Rolling Stone, Grantland and the like. They wanted to give those writers room to write about what they wanted, and to be able to take as much time as they needed in order to tell the stories they want to tell. They all augment those stories with original photography that deepens the narrative and captures the essence of the artists they are covering, whether on stage or out in the world. The overall experience will be fully immersive — an up-close look at artists with distinct visions, written by journalists with intelligence and integrity, for an audience of curious readers.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
