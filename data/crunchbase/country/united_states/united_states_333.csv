Membership in the Business Group offers you the opportunity to drive today's health agenda while exchanging ideas for controlling health care costs, improving patient safety and quality of care and sharing best practices in health benefits management with senior benefits, HR professionals, and medical directors from leading corporations. The National Business Group on Health members are primarily Fortune 500 companies and large public sector employers — including the nation's most innovative health care purchasers — who provide health coverage for more than 55 million U.S. workers, retirees, and their families. The Business Group fosters the development of a safe, high quality health care delivery system and treatments based on scientific evidence of effectiveness. They work to achieve transparency, expand the use of technology assessment to ensure access to superior new technology and the elimination of ineffective technology, and make scientific evidence of effectiveness the standard for care, among many other objectives. High annual increases in health care costs have been major problems for all employers in the US for a number of years, hurting their ability to grow and compete in a global economy. Everyone is paying a lot, yet the care they get is highly uneven. Sometimes they get the best in the world but in far too many instances Americans do not receive the right care, or medical treatment is downright harmful with tens of thousands of lives lost and equally as many hurt by avoidable medical mistakes and health care-acquired infections.

Those companies that successfully build an infrastructure to support rapidly evolving business objectives will be the survivors - and the winners. At the heart of this era’s challenges is the age-old problem of having the right products, at the right place, at the right time. Their solutions are designed to manage the variability in demand and supply through powerful forecasting and replenishment solutions, and then integrate them into powerful planning solutions that can deliver on the promise and vision of channel-specific merchandising. By delivering their solutions on the best and most powerful technology platforms available today, Evant provides unparalleled value to their customers. To deliver sustainable business value to their customers through advanced science and next generation technology. As a solutions provider, Evant is focused on more than delivering exceptional products and services. Their goal is to become a key, long-term business partner. They provide value in the form of strategic insight, deep domain expertise and a ""best-practices"" approach to operating your business. Their company values are centered on integrity, quality and service. They believe that a good software company is known for its products, but a great software company is also known for the way it interacts with customers, partners and employees. Evant was founded as a physical logistics company in 1994 by a team of industry experts including Stanford professor Dr. Hau Lee, with the goal of solving the most critical business problems that companies faced in the distribution of finished goods, whether a manufacturer, wholesale distributor or retailer. As companies began to reap the benefits of new applied science in their distribution systems in the mid to late 1990s, they also began to bolster their IT infrastructures. Evant led its customer base into this new technology era by developing sophisticated forecasting and replenishment and merchandising software solutions. Built on decades of sound logistics and distribution science, they helped their customers reduce inventory costs and raise service levels in record time. For example, Longs Drugs, their first software client, reduced its replenishment costs by more than 65% at its distribution center and more than 38% at its pharmacies in less than a year. These improvements significantly increased free cash flow, releasing more than $100 million in working capital that Longs used for other opportunities to increase earnings, including the acquisition of new chain stores. By the close of 2002, Evant delivered measurable business improvements similar to Longs Drugs for more than 40 Global 2000 companies. In addition to their outstanding customer track record throughout their company history, they also have remained one step ahead of the industry for nearly a decade, continually delivering the most cutting-edge demand chain science and technology applications.","Apps, Manufacturing, Other, Software",,,11-50,2,M&A,27000000,USD,27000000,27000000,USD,27000000,"Bain Capital Ventures, Crosslink Capital, Kleiner Perkins, Altos Ventures, 3i Group",2,8,,Private,,,,,,

They offer technical, commercial and financial support. Their holistic approach allow us to package solutions that meet requirements of the off takers. Due to the inherent conservative nature of large corporate companies, they do not extend themselves to take supply side risk.  On the other hand the miners being new do not have the banking support to collateralize on payment instruments when they sign contracts with steel mills. This leave many miners seeking high and low for bridge funding (purchase order funding) to service contracts. As they understand the risk and management of these deals, they are in a unique position to profit from these transactions  provided they can provide the purchase order funding. By supporting the miner they can offer a full service deal structure for the end buyers, similar to then they buy from large mining companies.  This involves their company taking the Letter of Credit from the end buyer and processing it, to extend an LC to the miner, an LC to the shipping company and then control all payments based on delivery of tested and cleared minerals to a free trade zone where they can take title to the product in smaller volumes while paying the miner based on smaller volumes delivered. This provides oxygen to the miner and allow them to work with us to manage the delivery of large contractual volumes that they otherwise would not be able to service. Once they have 90% of the minerals under their name they call the vessel which implies a 20% mobilization fee. Once the vessel is loaded, they can claim the buyers full LC. This purchase order funding approach can generate 10 to 30 USD/MT depending on mineral type.
