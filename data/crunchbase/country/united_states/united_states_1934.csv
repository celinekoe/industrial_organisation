ABC was founded by husband and wife team Matt and Rene Greff who share a passion for beer and adventure.  By their late 20s the Greffs had become disenchanted with their corporate gigs and soon after brewpubs were legalized in Michigan, they set about opening their own brewery.  They raised their startup capital through a network of friends, family, and co-workers and became the first brewpub to open in Ann Arbor and the fifth to open in Michigan’s fledgling microbrewery movement. Somehow they survived the trials and tribulations of their first few rocky years in business and by 2001 they had maxed out capacity on their 7 bbl system and were looking for ways to add new tanks.  Fortune was on their side when an adjacent building became available and they set about expanding their operations with the addition of a small banquet space, an additional 30 bbls of fermentation and serving tank capacity.","Community and Lifestyle, Food and Beverage, Travel and Tourism",2,"Matt Greff, Rene Greff",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
