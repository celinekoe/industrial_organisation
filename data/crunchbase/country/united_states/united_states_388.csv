Their strategy is to not hold, but to sell once renovated. Los Angeles and Memphis are significantly different markets, wherein Los Angeles is primarily a Owner Occupant market with a $700,000 retail price point and Memphis is a Investor/Non-Owner Occupant market with a $70,000 retail price point. Memphis is top tier in the nation for Rent-to-Price Ratios. Memphis cannot only allow the company to produce housing product that will typically have a 25-35% protective equity position, but also produce net cash flow at 140-300% of debt obligation to its note holders.The Company projects that the Properties will be sold within 10 to 90 days on average, and return a net profit of approximately 12 to 38%. They have developed a program called “CARE” for their tenant clients that is further disclosed in other marketing materials and assists tenants in becoming homeowners. Although the principal focus of the Company will be on the acquisition, renovation and sale of existing single-family residential real estate, the company intends to buy, sell and in some cases hold real estate mortgages also known as deeds of trust and other instruments for a specific time frame on a case by case basis for cash management and profit maximization.
