Instant Reviews solve these logistical challenges of reviews by repositioning the review process. We have placed the review capture on the post purchase thank you page and this one change has completely re-imagined the review process. We have seen an increase in attachment rate, increase in the amount of reviews collected, and an increase in positive sentiment.  Shopify and Shopify Plus merchants can use our plugin to drive an increase in revenue and conversion rate across their store. The plugin is easy to set up, easy to integrate, and looks great on all types of Shopify stores regardless of the niche.  Instant Reviews are powerful because they add an element of social proof to the product page. When shopping, customers look to their peers to gather ideas, thoughts, and assurance on a product purchase. Instant Reviews allows for confirmation on the purchase and they can relieve questions about the possible purchase that they would not otherwise get.","Commerce and Shopping, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
