Firstly, since the inspection and verification are a physical process, you’ll need the vehicle itself.  You’ll also need some supporting documents like the title, smog, bill of sale, and more.  Also, you’ll need to have the verification form, which is the REG 31 form. This form will be filled out by a verifier.  You might need to get the form yourself, although verifiers have the form already.  Suppose you live in Riverside County and don't have a mobile verifier to contact.  In that case, you can reach out to us at Quick VIN Verification for your vehicle inspection and verification.
