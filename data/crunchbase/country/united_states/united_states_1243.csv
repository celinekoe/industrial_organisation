In TerraCaptus' on-line patent auctions, the costs of setting up and conducting each auction are borne by TerraCaptus, and other costs normally associated with in-person patent auctions (e.g., for travel, lodging, and other logistical issues) are eliminated. In this manner, TerraCaptus' web-based auction platform has the ability to increase the number of potential bidders for any given patent. The TerraCaptus patent auction model also eliminates traditional up-front patent auction costs, such as costs associated with identification of and communication with potential buyers, advertisement of the patent for sale, preparation of the auction, and conducting of the auction. TerraCaptus charges nothing for these services, and instead is compensated from the proceeds of sale of the patent. Also, TerraCaptus is only compensated from auctions that result in a sold patent, and receives compensation only when the patent seller receives payment for the patent sold. Using TerraCaptus, potential buyers of each patent listed for sale are identified by TerraCaptus using proprietary software and (optionally) recommendations from the patent owner. These potential buyers are contacted by TerraCaptus, and are invited to a scheduled auction hosted on TerraCaptus' website. Each TerraCaptus on-line auction is public, utilizes a unique interface on TerraCaptus' website to easily enable registered parties to bid, and is open for viewing by parties who have not registered to bid. The pioneering TerraCaptus on-line patent auction system promises to revolutionize the way patent buyers and sellers perform their transactions, bringing a new level of liquidity to this valuable class of assets.","Commerce and Shopping, Financial Services, Information Technology, Internet Services, Privacy and Security, Professional Services",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Cougar is based in Sunnyvale, California - the heart of the Silicon Valley. Cougar's three facilities, two in Sunnyvale and one in Lakewood Colorado, total nearly 50,000 square-feet. Cougar's newest Sunnyvale facility houses the headquarters team and sales and design engineering activities. We've equipped the newest Sunnyvale facility with a fully self-contained engineering lab where engineers can oversee production of products from assembly through test characterization, all in a clean and certified environment. Manufacturing and additional engineering activities continue in the original Sunnyvale and Lakewood facilities. Teledyne Cougar recently acquired the assets of Avnet MTS, merging key MTS people, equipment and products into our business. MTS brings more than three decades of product and service experience from organizations such as Avantek and Pennstock. Cougar is not only committed to maintaining these products and services but we're excited to present them under the Teledyne Cougar banner for the first time and to nurture and grow them for years to come. Over the years, Cougar's key-to-growth has been consistent new product development and exemplary quality and service. Cougar's designs cover 100 kHz to 20 GHz and include amplifiers, VCO's, mixers, IQ products, switches, limiters, attenuators and multi-component integrated assemblies. We continually provide the highest quality and reliability in technically demanding applications for leading-edge customers including Raytheon, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, BAE Systems, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, NGST, Teradyne, Rockwell Collins, Saab, Astrium, and Alcatel. While Cougar maintains a strong presence in the space and military markets, we also deliver solutions for commercial applications and provide value-add manufacturing, testing, screening and packing services for all markets. In continuing our commitment to the highest quality standards, we undertook the daunting effort of double certification to two industry quality standards. In July 1998, Cougar successfully achieved certification to both MIL-PRF-38534 and ISO 9001-2000. The MIL-PRF-38534 certification is especially important to our continued pursuit of space business because Cougar received certification to both Classes H and K screening levels under the stringent TRB Option. Cougar is also certified to AS9100, satisfying our commitment to the aerospace community. Cougar's quality policy is a testament to these high standards: Quality-Performance-On Time. Cougar's daily success depends on the skills and experience of our staff. Bringing to Cougar varied corporate, educational, and training backgrounds, our staff's knowledge, skills and experience make Cougar the premier component and integrated assembly supplier in the RF and Microwave industry. Cougar's continual emphasis on the development and improvement of suppliers, processes, and products mean performance, reliability, and schedule advantages for our customers. We're familiar with the challenges our customers face, whether it's a state-of-the-art radar system, a multi-use communication satellite, or a back-end semiconductor ATE station. Our experience, product breadth, and exemplary staff are prepared for the challenge.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Manufacturing",,,1-10,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,1,Private,,,,,,
