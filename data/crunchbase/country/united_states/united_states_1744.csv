The patterns recognized enabled golfers to improve through focused quality practice and better course management skills. The concept was decades ahead of its time, so it was shelved until technology caught up with the idea. The Executive Caddie was aggressively revitalized in 2004 when Internet-enabled handheld PDAs and smartphones started to emerge. The updated mission of the Executive Caddie was to offer a unified software platform that makes golf fun for the individual and groups, while collecting invaluable data for analytical data mining and highly targeted advertising.  The Executive Caddie platform offers both consumer and industry products. The primary consumer product is a collection of smartphone apps that track detailed scores and stats, provide a GPS rangefinder, and allow thorough social integration. The smartphone apps continually post granular data to the Caddieâ€™s cloud storage that empowers courses to identify bottlenecks in play flow that jeopardize maximum profits. The secondary consumer products are subscriptions to enhanced content on the Memberâ€™s Website.

Most law firms focus on one or two topics. At Weldon Law Group, we work on a combination of immigration law, criminal defense, family law, and estate planning. One of the reasons we offer such a range of services is because we understand that our clients need more. Facing green card challenges one day, the next they may be fighting against an unjust DUI. Rather than hiring a second law firm, our clients are able to keep working with us. This approach allows us to form tighter relationships with our clients and this results in them feeling like one of the family. Ultimately, this means that working with Weldon Law Group is a much easier and more comfortable process than working with the competition. But don’t let our range of services trick you into thinking we’re anything but dedicated. Working across multiple subjects is a great way to get a better and fuller understanding of how the law functions in all its pieces. Wondering how a criminal charge is going to affect a visa? We know. Wondering if your current family law struggles are going to have an impact on your estate planning? We know the answer and we’re already reaching for the phone to offer some suggestions. Whether you need help with citizenship, green cards, visas, adjustment of immigration status, domestic violence charges, a license suspension, gun, drug, or theft crime charges, probate law, setting up a trust, or writing a will, you can rest easy knowing that Weldon Law Group’s dedicated staff are available to help. Don’t hire two law firms when all you need is one, just hire Weldon Law Group and rest easy knowing that you’re not just getting an attorney to work on this case, you’re getting an attorney that you could work with on just about anything you need legal services for.",,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

As it is a financial market after all, so one should be properly informed about the state of the world in order to make informed decisions. The issue was that he would spend two or three hours a day reading news articles that were all talking about the same few relevant topics. Opinions, summaries, full-length articles. He would have to read it all. That's where the idea of having a machine do this for him all started from. NewsInn is an Artificial Intelligence-Driven News Aggregator that scans the internet for news articles and delivers them based on different aspects like: Sentiment analysis, keywords, importance. It conglomerates topics into one big case, then lists all the relevant articles related to it. As we love reading the news, we observed that important sorries are covered by all major publications. But each one of them shares a slightly different point of view on the story. So the issue became the fact that we are reading the same story over and over again. So to fix that, NewsInn clusters multiple similar articles into one big single story. It is however possible that a story will appear two times on the NewsInn Feed. But this is not an error. This happens so that different points of view and different opinions on the same issue can be displayed. Another issue we always faced was to determine the opinion inserted inside the article. Knowing at a glance if the story is positive or negative, can give you a feel on the subject at hand. Besides this, there are days when you don't want to see the bad part of the world. For this, we created the ""Positive"" side of NewsInn. NewsInn reads the news for you and allows you to determine which full article you would like to read for further information. It also allows you to view only positive, objective or only negative articles. NewsInn is looking to become the go-to application for reading the news. It is not looking to replace major news providers, but to help our users better identify their sources of information.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Inspired by the wholesaling of goods, Priccut applies the bulk model to services across 12 main categories according to their website: www.priccut.com. The deals created would pull from the entertainment, food, transportation, home, fitness, travel, education, electronics, and many other industries to create deals that users buy once and return several times in the future to redeem all the services purchased.  A unique aspect of the Priccut plan is the way in which customers go about redeeming these bulk deals. Consumers use a Priccut card (which is offered free of cost through their website by request to who all deals are added. Consumers then go to the  merchant location for which the deal was purchased and they receive the deal. The consumer pays no money at the merchant location unless they purchase services beyond the original deal. Priccut was founded in November  of 2011 by François N. Bessing. Then 21, he was a business student at Lehigh Carbon Community College. He dropped out in late 2012 to pursue Priccut full-time.
