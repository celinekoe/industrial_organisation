We are dedicated to providing inventors, creators, and entrepreneurs with quality equipment and materials, excellent service, and furnishing a fun, clean, enjoyable atmosphere at an acceptable price. We will maintain a friendly creative work environment that respects diversity, ideas, and hard work. The timing is right for starting this new venture. The revolution of a new industry is upon us. The area of personal design and fabrication is expanding quickly as technologies advance and more cost effective equipment and materials have come in to the market. Many makers and entrepreneurs across the nation still can not afford even just a few of the necessary tools to meet their needs while almost none can afford the full suite of fabrication software, hardware, and equipment. We aim to provide them with access to a full set of the most relevant and up to date means to create at a fraction of the cost of ownership all while allowing them to run their very business out of our facilities. Joe Higgs, the founder, has worked in software design, hardware, networking, and systems administration for both government and non-government contractors for 20 years, has owned his own small business doing home automation and theater, and he has been a DIY-er and inventor since childhood. He has earned the respect of his colleagues through hard work, dedication, and a determined and positive attitude. Joe and his team have what it takes to make this venture extremely successful. Make N Mod will exceed the general expectation and grow a large, satisfied, and loyal customer base. For the convenience of our customers, Make N Mod will offer memberships and fee-based accessibility to computers with design software, prototyping equipment, hobby and inventor supplies and parts, in-house recycling of some materials, patenting information and resources, as well as incubator resources for small startups such as work & meeting spaces, business phone lines, and shipping addresses. Make N Mod will focus on consumers wanting to create, develop, and even sell their products, customers that need access to creative software & hardware tools and equipment, and customers that need resources to run their own business. In the future we will also accommodate consumers that would prefer to create remotely via a computer or personal electronic device and consumers that would use a creation service or purchase an item via kiosks & satellite locations.","Commerce and Shopping, Consumer Goods, Education, Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Manufacturing, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
