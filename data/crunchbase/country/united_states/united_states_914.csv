By cracking Small Data, we’ve built a cognitive-AI that can evaluate financial risk through a 1-click personality assessment using opt-in social media. This gives banks, lenders, insurance, Telco’s, etc. the only opportunity to  better decision and understand specific individual risk outcomes for thin-file, no-file and credit challenged consumers. Because the problem is this: 88% of consumers in LATAM are thin-file, no-file, and credit challenged. Not because they are poor, or that they are high risk, but rather because they just can’t be decisioned. And in LATAM average rejection rates hover around 85%. We have to convince NO ONE that this is a problem. So, what we are talking about here are the invisible consumers.  You cannot build a middle class . . . you cannot build wealth . . . without people having access to financial products good and services, cannot improve your own standard of living without access to financial process goods and services. And this is not about being banked or underbanked. That’s NOT the problem. “Banking” someone is fake financial inclusion.  The problem is this simple: if a risk-based business cannot determine the risk of the risk of the engagement . . . you are invisible. Period. It’s lack of access that keeps people poor. So, the LATAM market, for example, is only churning 12% -15% or less of the available market.
