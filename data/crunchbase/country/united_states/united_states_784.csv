In its short history, Recycling Perks has been successful in differentiating itself from competition. The program gives communities the opportunity to make an impact on their waste stream through recycling but to also make an impact on local businesses through the use of RFID technology. Using RFID technology and data analysis determinations can be made about which household has recycled, how often, and how that relates to key demographic information.  With these elements in place, Recycling Perks is able to strategically market to areas of low participation and relate use of local rewards partners to the individual a household’s profile. The benefit of using RFID technology is that it not only allows Recycling Perks to identify areas of improvement, but also allows provides an opportunity to reward, encourage and help to activate others in the community – giving residents ownership in the program.  Recycling Perks targets municipalities and individual haulers looking to increase recycling volume through the use of a recycling rewards program.  Ideal communities for Recycling Perks are (1) in the process of going to single stream from bins, or (2) communities that have a curbside program with stagnant collection metrics.

Overlaying this system, and integral to it, is highly efficient use of solar PV, solar thermal, wind, in-line hydraulic kinetic energy capture and energy storage: to produce the lowest cost firm, on-demand 100% renewable power in any defined circumstance. The SWT System also works to absolutely limit evaporative water losses in every circumstance it engages: agricultural, storage, canal, riverine, urban municipal and rural. The SWT system achieves the most efficient production of plant proteins, plant starches and plant-based minerals and vitamins. The SWT System achieves the most efficient production of fresh, organic vegetables, herbs, salad makings, vine fruit and cannabis. The SWT System achieves the most efficient production of bio-plastics and plant-based materials. The SWT System achieves the most efficient production of meat-based proteins and lipids.

The SWT System allows treatment and recycling as potable, all municipal and mixed municipal-industrial wastewaters, as well as most industrial and mining wastewaters.

The SWT System allows treatment and desalination-to-potable of brackish waters drawn from aquifers or agricultural runoff. It does so while generating a significant net profit on capital and operations absent any requirement for fees, tariffs or subsidies. Central to the SWT System is efficient breakdown and lysis of all volatile solids inputs and their subsequent phased-sequenced anaerobic digestion in a manner which allows efficient, parsed deployment of all inherent water, minerals, nutrients and energy. Nothing is thrown away or lost to the environment. A key system feature is intensive farming of plants of the Lemnaceae (sic: Lemnoideae popularly known as “duckweeds”) family within circumstances that: absolutely minimize evaporative losses of water; maintain temperatures within a favorable spectrum; allow CO2-enhancement of plant growth media (both air and water) and enable precise management of plant nutrition and photon irradiance. A key feature of the SWT System is use of abundant non-recyclable dirty and irregular plastic wastes, including thin film plastics, to produce highly robust molded, foamed paneling that can be employed structurally and as a floating platform for mounting PV panels, completely covering exposed water and thus preventing all evaporative losses.","Agriculture and Farming, Manufacturing, Professional Services, Real Estate, Science and Engineering, Sustainability",2,"Mani Vannan, Paul Skillicorn",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
