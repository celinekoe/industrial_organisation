Mobile teams frequently rely on phone calls and emails to communicate everything: Schedules, updates, documentation, pictures...the list goes on. Phone calls are siloed, only reaching those on the call. Emails are not made for instant communication and are messy when chains become long.  Cockpit Mobile's ""Field General"" creates instant messaging channels for each project. This help teams communicate in an organized fashion and also automatically documents correspondence into a master job file. A critical aspect of Field General is the ability to add subcontractors and clients to these instant messaging channels - traditional instant messaging such as Slack silo companies and make this difficult. Field General has 2 main use cases: venue/event management and delivery procurement.  Venue/event management consists of uploading a floorplan or layout and adding team members to that event. Management & staff can drag & drop virtual task lists across this map, pinning them to certain areas.  In real-time, the team is updated and can see what needs to be done, exactly where it needs to be done. They simply check off the item & can post proof of completion, helping their management and fellow team members understand progress and more efficiently execute. This has application in big box retail, construction, concerts, festivals, theme parks, campuses, and more. Our delivery module help bring the Uber feel to any home service or delivery (cable installation, mattress delivery, etc.). 4 hour windows are turned into real-time ETA notifications and a GPS view of the technician en route to your residence. The ability to instant message directly with the technician and drop a pin helps increase satisfaction for both parties.

Problem: How can we enable people to have fun while competing with their friends? Solution: A gamified mobile app that allows users to compete wagering social clout. Details: Users join groups with their close friends and with affinity categories (specific sports, TV shows, eSports, etc.). They challenge others in their groups to competitions (who can do more pushups, higher score on the test, which team will win, etc.). Friends see these competitions and predict the winner. After reporting the outcome, the winner and those who supported them increase their ranking in relevant groups. Friends also see competition results in newsfeeds and can engage via liking, commenting or sharing.   Features:  â	Newsfeed: The home screen where users engage with friendsâ new competitions, engage with competition results, and are served behavioral nudge advertisements for trending events.   â	Groups: Users form groups with their close friends and move up and down rankings within the group based on how much they are winning. Larger groups could include LOL stream watchers, NBA Fans, etc.  â	Trending Events: In addition to user-generated competitions, we have native content that allows users to make predictions on the outcomes of popular sports, live eSports, and TV shows.  â	AI Invitations: We gear towards virality by allowing users to challenge friends who donât already have accounts through phone numbers or email and increase conversion with an AI chatbot.  â	Virality: Millennials have a strong desire to stay updated about their friends' activities. Users often invite their friends because of the focus on groups and friends are very likely to accept invitations for fear of missing out.    Monetization: â	Native programmatic advertising nudges.  â	Competitions on events drive direct user engagement (ex. Someone predicting the outcome of a game or tv show is much more likely to watch it). â	This type of advertising has higher efficacy/engagement than traditional banner ads because it contributes positively to user experience instead of a distraction from it. â	Influencers: Users can come to our platform to follow the competitions of their favorite celebrities or brands. â	Data analytics and A/B testing as a service for big brands.   Traction: â	1000+ users registered for a chance at early access to the Beta â	Featured by Forbes at the Under 30 Summit, American Innovation Magazine, & BuiltIn Chicago â	Working with behavioral economists at the University of Chicago to drive and analyze behavior.","Apps, Community and Lifestyle, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Mobile, Software",1,Spencer Gordon-Sand,1-10,1,M&A,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
