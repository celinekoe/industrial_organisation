Though theirs was a family of humble means, giving was nonetheless a way of life.  This simple yet profound example instilled in him a lifelong practice of heartfelt philanthropy. A practice shared by his wife, Dr. Raissa Frenkel, and imparted to their sons, Eugene and Steven. Through strong work ethics and deeply held values, Drs. Finker and Frenkel have achieved extraordinary success. Success that could indeed be due in large part to a law of reciprocity: “The generous soul will be made rich, and he who waters will also be watered himself.”* Modeling the example set by their parents and grandparents, they follow a personal policy of extending help to any who had needs, regardless of race, religion or color. “The Foundation is a legacy that will hold future generations together to change the world.” Such was Dr. Finker’s motivation to create the Finker-Frenkel Family Foundation. He realized that great progress is not brought about in a day, but rather is the product of the collaboration of generations building upon one another’s advancements. As such, it would require the commitment of generations dedicated to the continuation of the work. Who better to make that commitment than a family that could pass the torch from parent to child, from child to grandchild?","Community and Lifestyle, Education, Health Care, Other, Social Impact",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
