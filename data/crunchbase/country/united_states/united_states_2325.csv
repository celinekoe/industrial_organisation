As the first to come out with this product, we've worked diligently to create something that makes a true impact on your life and the lives of your loved ones. As we continue to expand our brand, we remain committed to respecting our values and providing an alternative lifestyle of being mindful and seeking better when it comes to what we put on and in our bodies. As the world continues to navigate the most health-sensitive year in history, the question plaguing our minds is how cautious we can be to protect ourselves. When the COVID-19 crisis started, it became clear that the ingredients we use every day need to be evaluated for not only effectiveness but overall health safety. With everyone creating more and more products to be used in the fight against disease and germs, we at The Mentis Company took a different approach in the way we selected ingredients for our customers. About six months into the pandemic, supplies were running out in the stores, and we were forced to get creative when it came to sanitizing. But when we went through the common items needed to make the typical sanitizing cleansers, many of them became unappealing when you looked at how toxic they are, especially when you begin to breathe in those chemicals. So, we took matters into our own hands and set our sights on curating a cleanser that helps without harm. With extensive research, we landed on a key component that works for the skin in ways that harsh chemicals cannot. As the world continues to navigate the most health-sensitive year in history, the question plagued how cautious we can be to protect ourselves. While the year 2020 was underway, it became clear that the ingredients we use every day need to be evaluated for not only effectiveness but overall safety health. With everyone creating more and more products to be used to fight against disease and germs at The Mentis Company, we took a different approach in the way we selected ingredients for our customers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
