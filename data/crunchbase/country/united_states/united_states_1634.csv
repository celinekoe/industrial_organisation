It’s been a staple of couples’ bedrooms, and the cultural imagination, since its invention. Often considered a luxury, exclusively for the well-heeled and dainty-figured, few companies have done as much to make the attire easily available as Lacey Jayde Lingerie, an online seller of sensual lingerie that offers highly affordable prices and fast shipping. If Victoria really has a secret, it’s probably that you can save time and money by shopping at Lacey Jayde Lingerie.       Company Background Nearly two decades ago, Lacey Jayde Lingerie began as a small eBay business. Fast forward to today, and the company is a thriving e-commerce website, with a wide range of products and wares on offer. The company sells nearly 40 different kinds of romantic products in addition to lingerie, making it one of the leading online sellers of adult romantic wear. Leather/vinyl attire, camisoles, role playing outfits and much more--it’s all there in the seller’s colorful online store.    Big is Beautiful Lacey Jayde Lingerie proudly serves a demographic that the lingerie industry seemingly forgot about during the era when female beauty was typified by a thin, gaunt physique. Now that the curvaceous female figure à la Marilyn Monroe is beginning to reclaim its rightful position in our culture’s fantasy pantheon, Lady Jayde Lingerie has a leg up on the competition: they cater exclusively to full-figured, curvaceous women.   Affordable Prices Nice lingerie usually doesn’t come cheap, but pieces from Lady Jade Lingerie are nothing if not affordable. Instead of paying $100 for a single teddy at a big name retailer, shoppers at Lacey Jayde Lingerie could use the same amount of money to buy themselves a whole new wardrobe for the bedroom. Operating as a web-based business helps the company maintain low operating costs and create savings that are passed on to customers in the form of affordable lingerie.  Remarkable Service Some web-based businesses operate on a shoestring budget, and for them including a customer service plan is little more than a pipe dream. Lacey Jayde Lingerie, on the other hand, prides itself on providing great customer service. Customers can resolve many questions by visiting the FAQ page on the company’s website. Customers that need additional information can reach the company directly by calling (800) 760-6380. A customer contact form is also available on the website. Business Outlook At a time when many businesses are stuck between operating brick and mortar retail stores and selling goods online, Lacey Jayde Lingerie has fully embraced the online business model, opening its business to women all over the US and beyond. Considering the company’s underserved demographic, great service, affordable prices, and fast shipping, it is poised to expand its customer base in coming years, offering its products to plus size women around the world. To learn more about Lacey Jayde Lingerie or to order sexy clothing for special occasions, browse through the company’s website, or call (800) 760-6380 to speak with a representative.","Clothing and Apparel, Commerce and Shopping, Community and Lifestyle, Consumer Goods, Design",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Amir is seeking to build a “generation of farmers” - a camper planting a seed for the first time and later saving the seed from the crop for next year, a Farmer helping counselors sort trash from compost, a camp community committing to ethical food purchasing.
