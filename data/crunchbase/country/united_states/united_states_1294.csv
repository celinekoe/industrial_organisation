The magazine was launched as Photo Industry Reporter in 1993 by industry scions Ed Wagner and Rudy Maschke, who were legends in the photo publishing business. Labeling it “The Imaging Industry’s Business Paper,” their vision for the publication was to provide up-to-date news to help photo dealers stay informed.  Photo Industry Reporter was purchased in 2005 by Jerry Grossman, former vice president of Marketing at Nikon, and Alan Levine, a seasoned publishing executive at Condé Nast. As editor in chief and publisher, respectively, their goal was to reshape the publication by focusing on issues that help photo specialty dealers become more successful as technologies evolve. As the retail landscape changed, they also broadened the editorial focus of the magazine to reach not only photo specialty dealers but also large mass merchandisers, Internet retailers, distributors and key executives in the industry. In April 2013, they renamed the magazine Digital Imaging Reporter to reflect the dynamic market and the ever-changing ways in which images are now being captured, shared and printed. The magazine’s tagline, “Focused on the Business of Imaging,” speaks to their commitment to help retailers and manufacturers grow their businesses. They also launched PhotoReporter.com in 2006 as a complement to their thriving magazine, and along the way they brought in the industry’s most accomplished journalists, including Jason Schneider, Michael McEnaney, George Schaub, Barry Tanenbaum, Jon Sienkiewicz, Don Franz, Alice Miller, Kim Brady and Paul Worthington. In April 2013, the site was renamed DIReporter.com. Today, Digital Imaging Reporter is the ONLY print trade magazine in the imaging industry, reaching over 15,000 retailers, mass merchants, Internet buyers, distributors and key executives at every major manufacturer, and it truly remains “Focused on the Business of Imaging.”","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment",,,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
