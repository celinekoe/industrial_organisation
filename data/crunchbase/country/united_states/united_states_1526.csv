Giving them the best tools and the ability to be fully competitive, the power to keep growing event in a bad economy, and the freedom and flexibility they are hoping to achieve. Giving the companies the edge they are looking for to grow faster.  In order to survive and succeed in this world of accelerating change, modern marketing professionals need a new generation of marketing software to help them find more future customers; to build, sustain and grow relationships with those buyers over time; and to cope with the sheer pace and complexity of engaging with customers in real-time across the web. And in many companies, marketing must knit these digital interactions together with the efforts of their colleagues on the sales team.  Marketers need to interact seamlessly with their customers across all stages of the sales funnel, and they need data and analytic insights to understand where and how to allocate their budgets for maximum return. Our software must be easy to adopt and use. Visitors Lifecycle Management(VLM) software is fundamentally different from other kinds of business applications, like CRM, ERP and independent single point solution vendors. With those systems, the large companies typically configure them once, and then use them for months or even years with relatively little change. Marketing is much more dynamic – users need to constantly conceive, build and launch new marketing campaigns every few days or weeks, with minimum effort and no IT support. Our customers at Deskgod typically tell us that they spend one-half to one-third of the time as they did previously, which translates into much more time for them to invest in the creative aspects of their job. Our software must be powerful enough to solve real-world challenges. Modern marketing is challenging, to say the least. Marketers must control all aspects of visitors lifecycle management without of consistently switching between multiple applications like email marketing, analytics, help desk, live chat and more. Visitors are the lifeblood of the online businesses. Visitors must accurately guided to become customers, before being snatched up by competitors . And today’s marketer needs to be able to prove the results of their marketing investments, so sophisticated-yet-easy reporting and analytic tools are as important as campaign tools.  Deskgod was designed and built by real world marketing professionals who understand what marketers need to be successful. Still, Deskgod always balances powerful with easy, so that you can unleash the power when you need it, without having it in the way when you just need to get something simple done and out the door. Our software must be complete, for you and your customers. Your customers don’t care about what marketing software you use. But they will care if you use multiple disconnected systems that create a confusing user experience as they move from the web to email to live chat and beyond.  Deskgod Visitors Lifecycle Management(VLM) software spans the entire customer experience, across every stage of the sales funnel. Looking inward toward the marketing user, only  Deskgod combines completely integrated tools for managing the entire Lifecycle of website visitors, with powerful analytic tools to make sense of it all. Deskgod is the most complete marketing solution available today.","Advertising, Information Technology, Internet Services, Messaging and Telecommunications, Sales and Marketing, Software",1,Daniel Hristov,11-50,1,Seed,84700,EUR,113149,84700,EUR,113149,LAUNCHub Ventures,,1,,Private,,,,,,

At the time, evaporators did not use any type of mist pad. This was problematic because contaminants could become entrained in the exhaust vapor, possible causing an environmental impact outside the building. In 1993 ENCON introduced the world’s first thermal evaporator with mist pad technology as part of the standard design. Today, our tradition of innovation continues. Our MVC Evaporators can deliver a distilled water product with operating costs as little as $0.01 - $0.02 per gallon. Our Thermal Evaporators can be powered by a wide variety of power sources, from natural gas & propane to waste fuels such as off-spec landfill gas, waste oil, and engine & turbine exhaust. Evaporation is What We Do ENCON designs, manufactures, and distributes evaporators. Period. We’re not a subsidiary of some large corporation. We don’t sell a bunch of different technologies. We believe you can’t be good at everything. So we’ve chosen to be great at one thing: Evaporation technology. Company Overview ENCON Evaporators is located approximately 60 miles northwest of Boston in Hooksett, New Hampshire. We also have sales offices in Florida, Illinois, and Massachusetts ENCON Evaporators has installed hundreds of wastewater evaporators throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, South America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.

Some exceptions are the ENCON Drum Evaporator, as well as our smaller capacity (10, 18, and 28 gallons/hour) Thermal Evaporators that are heated by off-spec gas, natural gas, propane, steam, oil, and electricity. The gas systems are generally fabricated 2-6 at a time and may be inventoried for quick delivery.

Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, is the oldest incorporated boarding school in the United States. The Academy, widely known today as “Andover,” was founded at the height of the American Revolutionary War in 1778 by the Honorable Samuel Phillips, Jr. A converted carpenter’s shop served as Andover’s first classroom and contained a small group of boys of various ages, among them, a fifer in his father’s militia by the name of Levi Hutchens, who went on to invent the alarm clock; a future mayor of Boston and president of Harvard University, Josiah Quincy III; and John Lowell, Jr., who would one day found Harvard Law School.  Since its auspicious beginning, Andover has stayed true to its original mission, as set forth by Judge Phillips in the school’s founding constitution. In that document, Phillips ordained the school to “educate youth from every quarter,” for, among other noble purposes, the “great end and real business of living.” For more than two centuries, its students and educators have heeded Phillips’s doctrine on the importance of good character in laying the “surest foundation of usefulness to mankind,” because “goodness without knowledge...is weak and feeble; yet knowledge without goodness is dangerous.”  Paul Revere casted Andover’s unwavering mission thus, personally engraving its official seal, which includes two Latin phrases: Finis Origine Pendet (the end depends upon the beginning) and Non Sibi (not for self). According to the account book of Paul Revere, on April 5, 1782, he received two pounds eight shillings from John Lowell, a trustee of Phillips Academy, for his work. President George Washington visited the academy during its first year as part of his 1789 tour of New England. Upon his return, he recommended the academy to his nephews, who subsequently enrolled in the academy. In 1780, John Hancock ensured that Andover would serve future generations for centuries to come by scrolling his signature to the academy’s articles of incorporation.  Andover is the older of the two Phillips Academies, which are independent of each other. Phillips Exeter Academy, located in Exeter, New Hampshire, was founded three years later by Phillips’s uncle, John Phillips. The two schools have enjoyed a passionate sports rivalry since 1861, making it one of the oldest and most storied school rivalries in the nation.  For a century, Phillips Academy shared its campus and board of directors with the Andover Theological Seminary, which was the first graduate institution of any kind in the United States. The Seminary moved to Cambridge in 1908, leaving behind much of what comprises the center of Phillips Academy’s present-day campus, including Pearson Hall (formerly Bartlet Chapel), Foxcroft Hall and Bartlet Hall.  In the 1920s and 1930s, the campus underwent a major expansion around this historic core, thanks, in large part, to the vision and philanthropy of alumnus Thomas Cochran. The campus expansion included the neo-Georgian additions of Samuel Phillips Hall, George Washington Hall, Samuel Morse Hall, Paul Revere Hall, Oliver Wendell Holmes Library, the Dining Commons, the Addison Gallery of American Art and Cochran Chapel. Along with this new construction, at least nine existing buildings were moved to make way for the campus Vista and the Great Lawn.","Education, Other, Real Estate",1,Samuel Phillips Jr,501-1000,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

This portrayal, however, is inaccurate as the role of escargots (which simply means “snails” in French) is truly a food of the common people as they were a seasonal delicacy that was gathered from the wild by the peasantry.

Its purpose is to identify and analyze important issues to make globalization beneficial and sustainable for the people of the United States and the world and then to develop and communicate practical new approaches for dealing with them. The Institute is widely viewed as nonpartisan. The Institute attempts to anticipate emerging issues and to be ready with practical ideas, presented in useful and accessible formats, to inform and shape public debate. Its audience includes government officials and legislators, business and labor leaders, management and staff at international organizations, university-based scholars and their students, other research institutions and nongovernmental organizations, the media, and the public at large. It addresses these groups globally from its base in Washington. The Institute's staff of about 60 includes 20 senior researchers, as well as a dozen nonresident fellows, all distinguished for their combination of research productivity and policy experience. The Institute's agenda emphasizes international trade and investment, international finance and exchange rates, macroeconomic policy and crisis response, globalization and human welfare, and area studies of key economic regions. Institute staff have unique expertise on the major economies with special reference to China, India, Japan, Korea, Russia, the European Union, and the Middle East, as well as the United States itself and its NAFTA partners. Current priorities include global supply chains and multinational investment; the growing role of China in the world economy; the economic dimensions of the Arab Spring; globalization, inequality, and unemployment; the global financial and economic crisis and especially its banking and monetary components; national and international financial regulations; trade negotiations at the multilateral, regional, and bilateral levels; and possible reforms of the international monetary system. Institute studies have helped provide the intellectual foundation for many of the major international policy initiatives of the past three decades: reforms of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), including those initiated by the G-20 in 2009–10; adoption of international banking standards; Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and Trans-Pacific Partnership; the restoration and then extension of trade promotion authority in the United States; North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and other US free trade agreements (including with Korea notably); initiation of the Strategic and Economic Dialogue between the United States and China; reform of sanctions policy; liberalization of US export controls and export credits; and specific trade issues such as permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) for China in 2000 and Russia in 2012. Other influential analyses have addressed: economic reform in Europe, Japan, the former communist countries, and Latin America (including what became known as the Washington Consensus); the social impact of globalization; foreign direct investment both into and out of the United States; international environmental policy; measures of currency manipulation and of equilibrium exchange rates; and the sources and growth of services trade. The Institute celebrated its 25th anniversary [pdf] in 2006 and adopted its new name at that time, having previously been the Institute for International Economics. In 2001 it moved into its new building, which received an Award of Excellence for Extraordinary Achievement in Architecture by the American Institute of Architects and a Best Architecture in Washington Award by the Washington Business Journal.","Education, Financial Services, Government and Military, Other, Professional Services, Social Impact",,,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
