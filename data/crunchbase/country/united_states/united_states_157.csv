Chris Schalleur founded Christo Consulting in 1999 with the goal of providing the type of professional IT support larger companies enjoy to small businesses in the Philadelphia region. Chris Connolly joined Christo Consulting in 2000 and became a partner in 2006. In 2009, Christo Consulting went through two acquisitions which doubled both the number of clients and employees, as well as resulted in the visibility of the lack of work flow procedures in place. After a review of the problems that were occurring with tickets and invoicing, Chris and Chris mapped out what changes needed to be made and what the Christo Engineers needed to do.  The solution was what would evolve into NilearOS, an all-inclusive Operations Suite that provides Automation, Performance Metrics and Document Management for ConnectWise and Autotask. The majority of the NilearOS products were developed in-house by Chris Connolly to help improve services and reduce labor costs for the MSP business. Christo Consulting first launched what is now the Score My Team module of NilearOS in late 2010 to be utilized in-house by their engineers.  Over the next two years additional modules were added to comprise what is now the Nilear Operations Suite of tools for IT professionals. The product suite includes ConnectActive, ClientMapper as well as Score My Team, My Tickets Mobile, Schedule Sync, Configuration Station and Nilear Live. In November of 2012 NilearOS was made available for purchase by other MSP’s and the number of subscriptions has been steadily growing.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
