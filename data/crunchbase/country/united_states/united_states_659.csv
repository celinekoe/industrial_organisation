Every day was a crisis--  the nature of the business. As a diversion  they adopted a dog. They went to a  ‘Meet and Greet.’ There they met  a fawn , timid little girl.  They named her “GiGi.” Gigi was shy and fearful. The solution was: “get another one!” There was an  old boy that had just been saved from death.. He was in  the desert  starved,  hairless and covered with ticks.He had been adopted by a man who turned him loose in the desert to die. Dying was not on his agenda.  However, upon entering their house, Buck jumped on the bed with pointed ears and tail wagging, as if to say the past is the past and life is for living-- let’s get on with it!” Each day his strength grew and his fur grew back. He made a difference to Gigi who became confident and strong. Shortly after his adoption, it was decided that that dog had too much dignity to simply be “Buck,” so he forever more became “Mister Buck.” Because of Mr. Buck's attitude,  the  business was sold and Jon and Alonso committed their lives to god, rescue and care. Soon Mr. Buck was leading  dogs in nursing home visits and working with children of incarcerated gang members.  Since the time of first meeting Mr. Buck, Jon and Alonso have cared for more than 1000 dogs and had 52 of their own. Mr. Buck lived an incredible 14 years and 6 months, passing Thanksgiving week 2009. He is buried in the Memory Garden at Greyhound Boarding & Retirement Kamp – GBARK- which Mr. Buck was responsible for founding. To  to honor Mr. Buck’s memory and provide ongoing financial support for rescues everywhere,  “Mister Buck’s Genuinely Good Pet Food Company,” was created.  They have taken time and great care to select ingredients that have the quality to carry the venerated “Mr. Buck” name. A portion of each purchase goes directly to  Animal Rescue with an  amount going to (GBARK). Mister Buck’s legacy is to help provide pets that will become their own legends","Health Care, Travel and Tourism",,,1-10,1,,,,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
