In 2003, the founders of roundCorner and a few other partners who were working on global, Siebel implementations in financial services developed a collective philosophy around a simple concept. That concept was that there had to be a better, faster, less-complicated way to deliver on the promise of CRM. Together, this group founded OKERE, INC, one of the most successful enterprise salesforce.com consulting partners in history. OKERE was successful because of this philosophy, the quality of the team and OKEREâ€™s focus on a specific vertical industry that allowed the team to accelerate time to value for customers through shared best practices. After evolving OKERE to be the leading global salesforce.com consulting partner with over 100 consultants, offices in New York, London, Sydney and Manila, and over 75 happy salesforce.com customers representing over 70,000 enterprise salesforce.com users, OKERE was sold to Fujitsu in 2007. Shortly thereafter, roundCornerâ€™s founders began searching for new vertical markets that would benefit from the value proposition of cloud computing, be rich with innovative talent yet hamstrung by the current economic conditions and market forces. Equally important, they felt strongly that their next venture should focus on making a significant, positive social impact and that the Salesforce.com Foundation was the best vehicle for this social change. After collaborating with the President and CIO of Villanova University, the founders made a conscious, informed decision to launch roundCorner and become the Salesforce.com Foundationâ€™s premier solution partner. Two years later, roundCorner and the Salesforce.com Foundation are revolutionizing the way that colleges, universities and nonprofit organizations reallocate their assets to achieve their missions.","Information Technology, Other, Sales and Marketing, Social Impact, Software",3,"Dan Kanka, Dan Lammot, Nick Ward",11-50,1,M&A,,USD,,,USD,,Salesforce Ventures,1,1,,Private,,,,,,

At the time of the sale to Diamondback in February 2017, Brigham Resources was producing 8,500 Boe per day from its 80,185 net acres located in Pecos and Reeves counties, Texas. Their management team has a long history of identifying, acquiring, delineating and developing early stage domestic resource plays. Prior to forming Brigham Resources, a subset of their management team oversaw the identification, acquisition, delineation and development by Brigham Exploration Company of approximately 375,000 net acres in the Williston Basin prior to its December 2011 sale to Statoil ASA for $4.4 billion.  At present, ATX is evaluating resource opportunities in the U.S. Lower 48. Historically, the team has focused on early stage “frontier” opportunities that lack meaningful horizontal drilling validation, but would also consider partially delineated opportunities that have yet to fully benefit from an optimal drilling and completion formula. Going back to work in the Permian Basin and/or the Williston Basin would be two obvious alternatives, given the ATX team’s success in both of those basins. ATX is also currently evaluating opportunities in selected basins in the Rockies.","Energy, Natural Resources",2,"Gene Shepherd, J.

That's why you need to make sure that the person selling the car is being open and honest with you. You don't want to get taken for a ride. A good way to find out if you are getting a good deal or not is to ask the person selling the car some basic questions and seeing how they respond. If you don't like the responses to any of their questions, then it's probably not a good idea to be buying the car from them. The first question to ask is, ""Why are you selling the car"" Most people don't sell a perfectly good car for no reason, so ask yourself if their response makes sense. Secondly, ask if you can look at the VIN both on the dashboard and in the driver's side door. If they don't match, then you are dealing with a car assembled at a chop shop from stolen parts. Then ask if your own mechanic can take a look at the car. If they won't let that happen, then you know there are major problems with the vehicle. Finally, ask if you can take a 30-minute test drive. Many major problems don't turn up until the car is warmed up. If they will only let you take it on a five-minute test drive, the odds are that you don't want to buy the vehicle.",,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The site creates an almost instantaneous and fully-realized news package around as little information as a text message or tweet by pulling in and wrapping around related information from mainstream news and user generated content like blogs, videos, and pictures. Called the ""Automated News Room,"" Allvoices presents a 360 view of news events from multiple perspectives. The same technology vets contributions for authenticity and credibility, giving Allvoices citizen journalism's first and only ""Report Credibility Meter."" In just over a year, Allvoices has attracted more than four million unique visitors a month and a world-wide community of contributors in excess of 200,000, making Allvoices the largest user-generated news site on the web. Using proprietary algorithms, Allvoices scours more than 3,500 mainstream feeds and online, real-time sources of news like Twitter to provide relevancy and context for user-submitted news reports. This provides a level of security and vets contributed stories for authenticity. Story rank on the home page is determined by the number and diversity of other sources citing the particular news event, and community activity on the report.  The algorithm behind the Report Credibility meter is a proprietary, multi-faceted and adaptable approach to evaluating the trustworthiness of a report. At the core of the Allvoices' system are the everyday citizens and contributing-journalists that create news reports. The Report Credibility meter is an evaluation of the actual report content, as well as the reputation of the author of the report. As stories move through the different pages on Allvoices, the meter registers new levels of credibility for both the story content and contributor. The final determination of credibility is evaluated on a number of criteria, including: * How much does the community like or dislike content from the author? * How much does the community like or dislike the actual report? * How many other Allvoices contributors are reporting about the same thing? * How many other mainstream sources have supporting content about the report?  As users interact more and more with the Allvoices platform, the system learns more about the user, which in turn allows Allvoices to more accurately determine the authenticity of their reports. However, contributors to the site don't have to be long-time users. A new user can also have high credibility for their contribution as a function of time. When a new user reports a story it enters the Allvoices system with low credibility. But, as the story moves through the site's three news cycles—""This Just In,"" ""Breaking,"" and ""Popular""—it gains credibility, and will appear as a top-ranked news item. In turn, the story credibility helps with the reputation of the new user. Either alone—just people or just the algorithm—would be insufficient as a way to vet stories, but Allvoices' man-machine collaboration complements the strengths of each.","Content and Publishing, Information Technology, Media and Entertainment",1,Amra Tareen,51-100,2,M&A,3040000,EUR,4273099,3040000,EUR,4273099,VantagePoint Capital Partners,,1,,Private,,,,,,
