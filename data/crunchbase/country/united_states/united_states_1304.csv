The EcoQube is a miniature aquatic ecosystem for your home or office. The heart of the EcoQube is the Aquaponics Filter, which grows herbs, house plants, or flowers indoors while using the same plants to purify and remove physical and soluble chemical waste from aquarium water. The filter converts fish waste into fertilizer for the plants and the plants then clean the water for your fish, serving as a natural water purifier so that you never need to replace any filters. Light emitting diodes (LEDs) at the top of the unit emulate the spectrum of natural sunlight to ensure that your plant grows with ease. Simply feed the fish, trim the leaves, and reap the rewards. The same filtration system can also be implemented on larger systems such as aquaculture (tilapia farming), agriculture, localized food production and sewage treatment. TECHNOLOGY Current Filters require over $150 and 20+ times of filter changes per year. Most people don't do it resulting in over 80% of fish dying within the first year. Our aquaponics filter integrates the farming method of aquaponics: the use of plant roots to filter water and directly convert waste into fertilizer for growth. Core advantages include: 1. Full Spectrum Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) that emit specific spectrums for photosynthesis- enabling the aquarium to be placed in any lighting condition.  2. First ever, UV LEDs for water sterilization.  3. Mechanical designs for optimized oxygen content, root growth and filtration.","Agriculture and Farming, Education, Food and Beverage, Manufacturing, Real Estate",2,"Eric Suen, Kevin Liang",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Currently there is one channel that is cablecast simultaneously over Comcast channel 21/916 and Charter Communications channel 187 . MPACT operates under agreements with the City of Monroe and Monroe Charter Township. PEG access stands for Public, Education, and Government access. PEG access centers exist because of a federal mandate that allows citizens to request that their local governments provide a PEG access center. These centers are funded by local governments through fees paid by local cable providers for use of the public rights-of-way. A franchise agreement is negotiated that includes capital costs for the center, as well as a percentage of franchise fees paid to the local government to cover operating costs of the center. All local governments collect franchise fees, but many do not use the money to provide PEG access for their residents. MPACT maintains a Community Bulletin Board. This is a free information service for non-profit organizations and educational and public institutions that publicizes community events over PEG access channel(s). The information may be provided on one of their grid sheets which are available at the office. Information must be non-commercial (no advertisements). Completed grid sheets, flyers or Power Point slides can be mailed, e-mailed, dropped off, or faxed. MPACT also provides professional production facilities for studio members who have completed training and who wish to produce their own programs for non-commercial purposes. Locally produced programming is offered each week. Training is available for residents of Monroe Charter Township and The City of Monroe who wish to become involved in production work.* *For information on membership, classes in access television production, services and fees, please call the MPACT Studio during business hours. All Monroe Public Access Channels are owned and operated by MPACT, an independent non-profit corporation and not an agent or affiliate of the cable company or any franchising authority. Cable companies and franchising Authorities are prohibited by law from controlling the content or programs on public access channels.
