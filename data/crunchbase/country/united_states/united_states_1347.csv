EPIC was founded in 1977 when local residents came together to successfully end aerial applications of herbicides by industrial logging companies in Humboldt County. For more than 30 years, the organization has been at the forefront of environmental protection, ensuring that state and federal agencies follow their mandate to uphold environmental laws and protect endangered species. EPIC uses an integrated, science-based approach that combines public education, citizen advocacy and strategic litigation. They protect and restore areas within their bioregion. They implement strategies that will strengthen the way conservation laws are interpreted and implemented throughout the state and nation. Their work played a pivotal role in bringing the plight of the Headwaters Forest to the world’s attention during the 1990s. Three of the six groves in Headwaters Forest are now in public hands and EPIC continues to pursue actions to preserve the forests left unprotected as part of the infamous Headwaters Deal. Their work led to the permanent protection of other important areas, including an ancient redwood grove that towers above the ocean in the Sinkyone Wilderness, and Gilham Butte, an ancient forest that connects an old-growth reserve, Bureau of Land Management lands and Humboldt Redwoods State Park. They have filed approximately 70 lawsuits on behalf of imperiled species and their habitat and many of theor victories have established important legal precedents. These include two successful cases before the U.S. Supreme Court and two before the California Supreme Court. EPIC’s achievements and the group’s important role in California resource policy have been recognized by the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, which named EPIC one of the most effective organizations in California. They remain vigilant in their efforts to protect forests and watersheds on corporate-owned forestland, and have expanded their scope to address risks facing other areas of Northern California. Their areas of focus include industrial forestry reform, public land conservation, clean water and biodiversity protection.","Government and Military, Other, Professional Services",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Users of our service will never miss a change that affects them personally or professionally so they can take action accordingly.
