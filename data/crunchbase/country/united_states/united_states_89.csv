As the business these days are shifting online, therefore the need to market this online platform has become really very important. Let us take a look at the aspect, why SEO is important. Almost all the business owners believe that they will not be able to make a sufficient progress in their business unless they make an online presence. Besides, this online presence is also not enough to obtain high customer traffic. The traditional methods for marketing involve the hard work of experience professional to formulate the campaigns and run them successfully. Even the marketing on internet also requires similar methods, it is just the background is different.  If we take a look at the methods involved in traditional marketing, and their evolution for the internet, the common one comes out is marketing through advertisements in newspapers and magazines. The main problem with this method is its limited scope due to factors like popularity, readability, etc. Besides that, it is even more difficult to track down the advertisements even for a short span. All these factors cannot fully exhibit the business in front of their customers. Now turning to SEO marketing, a mere website of a business can hold almost all information about the business. And making an effort to push it towards the top position on the search engine ranking is itself a type of marketing which will surely impart an advantageous psychological impact on the internet users. The top position of a website itself indicates the good will and excellence of the business in the field. Apart from that, with SEO a webmaster can also monitor the audience and their needs for making future strategies in favor of the business. Tools like Google Analytics can be utilized for this purpose. With the traditional methods of marketing, one has to shout about the credibility of the business, but the scenario is completely different in SEO. The top position of a website itself indicates this factor about the business. That is why SEO is a chief method for internet marketing.","Information Technology, Internet Services, Sales and Marketing",1,Devendra Yadav,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
