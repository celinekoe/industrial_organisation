The firm has over 50 employees and operating offices in New York City, Los Angeles, London and Singapore. The Firm underwent a strategic reorganization in August of 2015, and today only manages and invests the Firm's own investment capital. nxVenture Capital does not manage nor does it solicit outside investors or investment capital, operating as a ""Private Investment Company"" as defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940 (as amended).  nxVenture Capital's operating structure is highly unconventional in the financial sector, and resembles a Silicon Valley technology firm more than a conventional investment management company. Even the Firm's office interiors are designed as performance-based holistic workplace environments that include the integration of cutting-edge technology and media to create dynamic spaces that foster innovation and collaboration. nxVenture Capital collaborated on the unique design of their office interiors with Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM), one of the largest and most influential architecture, interior design, engineering, and urban planning firms in the world. nxVenture Capital's business model relies on the Firm's strategic operating foundation as a private investment firm. This affords nxVenture Capital's management much wider latitude operationally than a firm relying on outside investment capital. ability to conduct its investment operating environment. The Firm operates free of the inevitable pressures that are inherent with the common industry model of managing multiple investment funds capitalized by outside investment capital.",Financial Services,,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
