(BRI) is seeking funds to develop and market the medium to high speed VTOL aircraft gyro stabilized by a rotating disk.  It is well known that the conventional fixed wing VTOL aircraft is highly unstable, especially in vertical flight close to the ground and transition to forward flight.  For over 60 years every conceivable design has been developed.  Of these only Harrier has been fielded.  BRI has solved the aircraft instability problems by incorporating a light weight disk rotating at a very high angular velocity.  The entire aircraft becomes a gyroscope virtually eliminating the VTOL aircraft instability problems.  The gyro stabilized VTOL aircraft flight is stable and steady in all flight conditions.   Currently there are several Government agencies planning to develop and deploy medium to high speed VTOL aircrafts by 2018-2020.  BRI strategy is to rapidly develop low cost prototypes applicable to these programs, enter partnerships with large prime contractors and together propose systems based on the gyro stabilized VTOL aircraft. The first phase will be to demonstrate and validate the Shadow VTOL UAV.  The program will cost $600,000 and will take six months to complete.  The next phase will be to integrate it into an existing UAS.  This phase will cost $2.2 million and will take 12 months to complete.  This program will be followed by Shadow VTOL UAS advanced development and production, and the programs to build and test the Medium Range Multi-Purpose UAV/UCAV, Cargo UAV and 4 Seat Manned/Unmanned VTOL aircraft prototypes.  For each of these designs BRI will seek partnerships with one or several large primes.  The advanced development programs will be followed by production programs.  The cost magnitude of such programs is in the hundreds of millions/billions of dollars.","Consumer Electronics, Consumer Goods, Data and Analytics, Design, Hardware, Information Technology, Manufacturing, Software, Transportation",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
