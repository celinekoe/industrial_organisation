Experts agree that dogs are naturally pack animals, so even with a loving owner, they are often are missing something when not being able to be around fellow-four legged friends. The new app Woofr makes it easy for owners to link up and arrange doggie fun or even date days, love could be in the air for pooches and people alike! While a dog may be a man (or woman's) best friend, this still doesn't change the fact that their nature, as pack animals, is to want to spend time bonding with fellow canines. Did you know that there are over 500 million pet dogs globally, plus 1 in 5 has a social media account?!! Furthermore many people face the problem of not having access to another dog or dogs for their beloved pet to play and bond with, a solution was definitely needed. Answering the call, is what some are calling the “World's First Doggy Dating App” Woofr, a fun mobile app (‘social petwork’ if you will) that allows users to show off their pets to make connections with other local dog owners and arrange doggy play sessions, that will likely help their pets be more happy and healthy, and who knows, love could be on the cards for the owners too! The app is available for free on iOS and is coming soon on Android. So there may be just a bit of doggy romance or at least new friendships in the air for both hounds and humans. “When it comes to making connections swiping left or right has become an integral part of the dating experience for many people,” commented James Gaubert, from Woofr. “Now we've opened the door for pet people to use the same kind of cool and convenient technology to find BFF's for their beloved pooches, and maybe even a little love for themselves, something which everyone is sure to enjoy and appreciate, Woofr is the dating app that puts hounds first and humans second”. https://apple.co/2Kz1t0O","Apps, Community and Lifestyle, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Mobile, Software",1,James Gaubert,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
