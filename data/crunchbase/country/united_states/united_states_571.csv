They have spent almost two years researching current technology, the scrap tire recycling industry and negotiating a licensing agreement with the technology inventors and are ready to move forward with their business plan. They need to close out their phase one funding to optimize the catalyst for crumb rubber and design a scaled refinery for operations. They have preliminary commitment from a VC group for phase two consisting of refinery acquisition and initial production. Roughly 300 million scrap tires (3 million metric tons) are generated each year in the United States, equal to approximately 1 tire per person in the country. Most of these tires are reused in various applications, +/- 129 million being burned as tire derived fuel and about 50 million tires go into landfills or other land disposal options. The entire industry is subsidized by the federal government from a scrap fee of 1-3 dollars per tire.  Thermo-catalytic pyrolysis has been around, in one form or another, for a very long time. The difference is the catalyst and its ability to re-formulate the hydrocarbons into economically viable products. Their research has not found another process that can equal the yields and alternative and renewable fuel types that their proprietary process has evidenced. Utilizing this technology W2F will produce LP Gas, Diesel or Jet A fuel (depending on the new minimum standards) and carbon black in economically viable quantities. This is economically viable because of the utilization of existing crumb rubber supplies. Once established, W2F will have the platform to move into the scrap tire recycling market and provide a tee-to-green approach to the scrap tire problem.","Energy, Information Technology",1,Jon Roberts,1-10,2,,2092886,USD,2092886,2092886,USD,2092886,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Founded in 2009 by University of Chicago graduates Jason Brown and Jasper Platz, Solmentum provides affordable metered electricity similar to your current utility company. However, unlike that company, who probably gets its electricity from coal or natural gas, Solmentum is able to provide its customers with clean solar energy. Here’s how it works:  If you qualify, Solmentum installs solar panels on your roof. Because of recent energy programs at both the State and the Federal level, this process requires only a minimal upgrade fee. Also, because of our partnership with SunRun, a leading financing company for residential solar power, Solmentum is able to set up financing, or leasing, options with well qualified buyers.  Finally, after the panels are installed, you are able to buy clean solar electricity at a guaranteed rate. In the current market, where energy costs are on the rise and expected to keep climbing, having a fixed rate for your energy bill provides both savings and peace of mind.  Since its inception, Solmentum has provided this peace of mind to more than 1,000 happy homeowners in the form of over 5MW of electricity. Although headquartered in San Francisco, Solmentum has expanded rapidly and now has offices in the San Jose, Bakersfield, and Orange County regions.","Energy, Natural Resources, Sustainability",1,Jasper Platz,11-50,1,Seed,325000,USD,325000,325000,USD,325000,"Ed Chandler, Lon Chow, Armando Pauker, Travis Bradford",,4,,Private,,,,,,

Each year, guitarists download more than 500 million tablature pieces; 98% of these 600 million tablature downloads are unlicensed AND are low-quality ""user generated"" transcriptions that are often inaccurate, incomplete and poorly formatted. United We Tab is focused on materially improving these market deficiencies, and the company's has developed an online offering that features an expansive selection of guitar tablature, interactive online technologies, and streaming video, which are outlined in summary detail below: 1) Compelling Videos and Technology:  UWTâ€™s free, full-length demonstration videos, which accompany thousands of tablature files, along with custom-built interactive tablature viewing software, offer a significantly improved user experience; 2) Highest Quality:  UWTâ€™s highly accurate tablature provides consumers a superior (and 100% legal) alternative to pirated and â€œuser-generatedâ€ websites, which mainly offer low quality and incomplete transcriptions; 3) Faster Access to New Hit Songs:  United We Tab transcribes new songs in record time, filling a material void for new songs consumers want, but rarely find on other tablature retail websites; and 4) Accessible Price:  UWTâ€™s superior selection and user-experience, combined with its low prices (often only $0.99 price per tablature file), offer a compelling proposition to consumers.","Commerce and Shopping, Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
