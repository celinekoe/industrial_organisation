Users can register on Fritter to grab the best deals from their favorite local restaurants and order from them online! Restaurants upload their menus, specials of the day, events, and promotions for registered users to see. Fritter lets users order from any restaurant that lists their menu online with the option of getting the food delivered. Users browse items from various menus and pick and choose from them to fit their appetite. Fritter works with restaurants who do not offer a delivery service and pairs them up with a qualified driver in a ""driver-share"" program with other restaurants nearby. Meaning restaurants that cannot afford to take on the hassle of employing and insuring delivery personnel have the ability to grow their business with minimal effort. Users can group order at work, add restaurants to their favorite's list, and order from one or more restaurant on the same bill. Fritter allows the user to have direct contact to the restaurant and delivery drivers in real time via email and text message. Deliveries are tracked via geo-tagging in real time so the user knows where the order is. Fritter was founded in 2010 by Derek Dahl, a techie think tank with a background in engineering. Fritter's headquarters are located in Mooresville, North Carolina, which was ranked as the fastest growing microcosm in the United States (Suburb of a Major City). The idea to develop Fritter came from a need for restaurants to maintain constant contact with members in the community. There was no centralized place for restaurants to directly contact hungry people and lure them in with promotions. It was decided to offer online ordering when a large percentage of locals complained about ordering food from restaurants over the phone, especially when they were busy. Fritter organizes all orders for restaurants to help increase workflow and productivity of their staff. Finally hungry people can be sure that their order is prepared the way they want it. Fritter has released a number of tools that let the restaurants stay in control of their menus. Private label ordering says time and builds the image and brand of even the smallest mom-and-pop stores.  Hungry people go to Fritter.co","Administrative Services, Commerce and Shopping, Food and Beverage, Travel and Tourism",1,Derek Dahl,11-50,1,Seed,250000,USD,250000,250000,USD,250000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Among the firm's associates, they have owned five seats on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and have been members of all major American Exchanges. Associates have served in various capacities in all facets of the investment banking community; they have been affiliated with the American Stock Exchange (ASE), The National Association of Security Dealers (NASD), the Boston Stock Exchange, the District Business Conduct Committee of the NASD, The Wall Street Planning Group, The Arbitration departments of both the NASD and ASE, as well as the New Products Committee of the NYSE and the ASE. One of their principals was a founding member of the American Commodities Exchange and the New York Futures Exchange. From time to time, the firm has also proposed unique security regulatory modifications to the investment banking industry, many of which have been adopted. Members of the firm have acted as advisors to various Congressional Committees regarding securities matters. Frequent white papers have been authored by the firm regarding solutions and potential pitfalls that are relative to intricate security regulatory problems, at the request of Congress. In the past, members of the firm have hosted the various regulators from emerging Pacific Rim Countries in advising and initiating training programs: security enforcement procedures, back-office operations, clearing procedures and transaction executions. Their associates have written and published articles and books on highly technical strategies in software, computers, economics and social history. CSC has acted as consultants for the United Nations in the areas of technology and complex economics. They have hosted seminars in which Commissioners of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.S. Attorney, the Congressional author of ERISA, U.S. Senators and other equally prominent legislators and regulators have spoken. Many of these events they have held at the New York Stock Exchange. Their people have also given seminars for the Wall Street Community on NYSE regulations, 390 and 394, negotiated rates, best markets and soft dollar payments. Prominent among those that have participated in their forums have been senior officials at some of the world’s largest banks, brokerage houses, exchange officials, specialist firms and regulators. The firm is especially proficient in identifying the relationship between proposed additional regulations that insure transparency and the ultimate cost effectiveness of this action relative to business profitability. Moreover, they have been vocal in enumerate potential changes relative to Generally Accepted Accounting Principals (GAAP), concerning issues related to off-balance-sheet transactions. To benefit as they relate to GAAP accounting issues, Sarbanes Oxley enforcement issues as well as the dramatic changes taking place within the marketplace itself as the inevitable shift to electronic order entry and execution irreversibly accelerates its march forward. The firm has also worked on numerous occasions to interpret the effect of regulatory rule changes regarding such esoteric interests such as short selling, margin rates and stock loans. Numerous books and articles have also been produced by the firm, which are meant to evaluate second and third world risks for their corporate clients who are evaluating international expansion opportunities. They have included almost forty country evaluations in their Point of View section. These country evaluations are a no holds barred appraisal from both a regulatory and taxation point of view, along with sophisticated evaluations of relative government stability, intellectual property rights, debt to gross national product ratios and wage sensitivity. They also look at the educate-ability quotient of the population as well as the government’s ability and desire to create a multi-national friendly environment. Undesirable factors such as massive inflation, unbalanced import-export duties and the ability of internal products to be marketed to local markets are also issues that the country may fit into the transfer pricing daisy chain. On Wall Street they all deal in resumes' describing their various firm's strong points. Have you ever heard of a firm that gave their weak points as well and they are certainly not going start now. However, Wall Street is great at giving advice and not so hot on taking it. As a percentage, broker-dealers probably have a shorter life expectancy that any other business. Since 1950, at the end of every decade only 20% of the brokerage firms had survived bearing the same name. They have never learned how to either prepare for the future or deal with the past. A former Chairman of the New York Stock Exchange served substantial time for fraud, Merrill Lynch and other were involved in highly unusual transactions with Enron and if the firm had been smaller, it would have closed. On this street, bigness represents survivability. During the 1980's and 90's many small broker dealers were taken over by either the Italian or Russian Mafia and there was little that the National Association of Security Dealers could do about it. What you see here is not necessarily what you get. One of Wall Street's great stories in that regard concerns the famous George Soros, the founder of Quantum Fund, and his wizardry in calling the shots in the global marketplace. George has a son named Robert who actually told it the way it was. ""My father will sit down and give you theories to explain why he does this or that. But I remember seeing it as a kid and thinking, Jesus Christ, at least half of this is bullshit. I mean, you know the reason he changes his position on the market or whatever is only because his back starts killing him. It has nothing to do with reason. He literally goes into a spasm, and it's this early warning sign."" How many of us were ever aware that international markets may rise or fall depending upon George Soros' back ailments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

This firm builds their reputation on the attitude they put forth in their work, the integrity that drives their behaviors and the results that they inevitably gain for their clients. To understand their business it is vital that you understand their beliefs.  At AIR Business Consulting, every employee, from the C.E.O. down to the newest account executive operate with the same values. This is one of the reasons why their team has been so successful collaborating on huge client projects. They believe that regardless of circumstances, their attitude will directly correlate to the success or failure that they endure. Additionally, it is something that they are well aware that is in their control. Something so seemingly simple, yet difficult to master, is one basic concept that sets the tone for their company. With having the freedom to work independently as well as a part of the team, management often takes a hands off approach, allowing them to empower their people. In order for this method to work, (which it has proven to), integrity must be at the forefront of their values. Doing the right thing, even when nobody is around to see, is the number rule at this Gaithersburg-based firm. By doing so, there is a level of trust amongst co-workers, customers and clients that is hard to go un-noticed. Lastly, the results that AIR Business Consulting brings to their clients speaks loud and clear. They increase profitability by generating new business and providing solutions for some of the largest companies in the United States that will allow them to sustain continual growth. With a team dedicated to the growth of their clients, a domino effect ultimately ensues. With continually delivering high quality results, their own firm grows substantially as well. This also provides the employees opportunities for career advancement based on their contributions to said growth.
