We currently provide this service in California, and are underway in our plans to make it available in new markets in the near future. We started off as one of the first companies authorized by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to conduct commercial drone operations to provide crop scouting services for California vineyards, and have since grown to the point where the platform and software we built to serve our own customers has been used by drone operators on five continents to serve local growers.

By pursuing this mission, they help public education fulfill the promise of equal opportunity. Step Up For Students is a state-approved nonprofit scholarship funding organization that helps administer two scholarships for Florida schoolchildren: the Florida Tax Credit Scholarship Program (FTC) for low-income families and the Gardiner Scholarship (PLSA) for children with certain special needs. Public education is rooted in the promise of equal educational opportunity, and nowhere is that covenant more relevant than in the lives of children who live near poverty or for students with certain special needs. A quality education should not be determined by financial means nor disability. Through the scholarships, we empower parents to give their children a chance at a brighter future. The FTC scholarship program was created to benefit children whose educational options are limited by household income. The scholarships are not tied to the performance of public schools nor the students who receive them. The program is different primarily because it directly targets students with the fewest options available. The latest state-commissioned research determined that students who receive the FTC scholarship are among the lowest-performing in the public schools they leave behind. This means the FTC scholarship is serving the most disadvantaged children in Florida. Their scholarships provide parents a way to help their children find success.","Education, Other, Social Impact",1,John Kirtley,101-250,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

It started with a small-scale dream laced with epic ambition. After years of working on high-profile games with super-sized teams and 4+ year development cycles, Phil decided it was time for change.  He missed the feeling of making games â€œback in the dayâ€ when it was all about creativity, fun, fast iteration, fun and innovation. But mostly fun!  To recapture that spirit he set off to build a group of like-minded individuals.  It wasnâ€™t long before he had assembled a talented team of game veterans and Gravity Bear was up and running. Gravity Bear enhances existing social platforms where players of every make and model can connect to one another through games. And not just any games, but games that focus on what truly matters â€“ unabashed fun for all.
