The company strives to ensure that the highest quality of service is provided, with all the conveniences and amenities necessary for an enjoyable stay made available. The company was established with the goal of providing superior value for the money, and every effort is made to make this apparent in every aspect of its service. With Roark Travel Club’s VIP treatment, guests are able to enjoy a level of service typical of the most exclusive clubs and hotel accommodations.   This quality of service extends to the booking process as well. All of the Club members are given priority booking in each and every one of the company’s network of resorts. This ensures that guests are able to visit any of the 2,500 resorts that the company is affiliated with, as well as enjoy a more convenient and hassle-free travel experience.   There are a number of key features provided by the Club that isn't available anywhere else. All customer concerns are ably handled by the company’s Branson Hotline service, which gives guests a direct line to friendly and accommodating customer support staff. Well-trained and extensively experienced, this team ensures the very best quality of customer service possible.   Fitness buffs who wish to stay in shape throughout their vacations will be able to do so by way of the company’s Club Roark health club membership, which is provided at no extra charge in most of the travel destinations on offer. This feature ensures that guests have access to weight lifting equipment, saunas, tanning beds, indoor pools, kiddy pools, and much more while on vacation.   Many of the Roark's travel destinations are exclusive offers only available to club members. An example is Emerald Pointe, which provides travelers with a unique opportunity to visit one of the last remaining open areas of land on Table Rock Lake. With its majestic views, expansive wooded lots, and close proximity to modern conveniences, the area not only serves as an ideal spot to visit while on vacation, but a worthy option to consider for future settlement in the future as well.   Roark Travel Club also provides guests with exclusive access to the company’s own vacation resort, which is ideally situated on the picturesque banks of Lake Taneycomo. Located in the heart of breathtaking Ozark Mountain Country, the lake is only a few minutes’ drive away from the tourist attractions at Branson. Nevertheless, it offers a distinctively small town atmosphere that makes it an excellent spot for travel and leisure. Boasting of an outdoor swimming pool and boating and fishing facilities, Lake Taneycomo is one of the most popular stops on a Roark Travel Club vacation.   Those with a taste for adrenaline-fueled adventures will definitely want to check out Roark Travel Club’s Vigilante Extreme ZipRider. The ride begins atop a 230-foot observation tower, which guests reach via a glass elevator that offers a stunning view of the surrounding countryside. From there, guests have the choice of one of four zip lines, each of which whisks them downhill over 160 acres of historic homestead. Only for the bravest of adrenaline-junkies, the ZipRider is one of Roark Travel Club’s most memorable attractions.   Other exclusive Roark Travel Club attractions are the Trail of Lights in Branson, Missouri, which takes guests through a breathtaking drive through an animated Christmas display; the Shepherd of the Hills stage performance held every night; and the Christmas on the Trail attraction, with its unique Cowboy Christmas feature. The Shepherd of the Hills is an especially impressive feature, with more than 80 actors, 40 horse, a flock of sheep, and authentic turn of the century props giving life to the celebrated Harold Bell Wright-penned epic tale.","Real Estate, Travel and Tourism",,,101-250,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
