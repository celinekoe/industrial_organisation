The .52-mile professional grade kart track at KCA allows drivers to burn up the road at speeds up to 55 mph.

With college costs swelling and the competition for admission to the most select institutions escalating, parents have zealously pursued athletic scholarships or the perceived edge that a top athletic résumé can bring. To chase this athletic advantage, parents begin investing in their child's athletic career early, as young as 5 or 6 years old, with private sports tutors, fees for travel teams and annual summer camps, instructional trips abroad and thousands of dollars in equipment.

The restaurant industry? Yes! Here’s why... Digitization, globalization, and urbanization all contribute to the industry becoming one the largest and most durable employment engines in the country. We can’t eat megabytes of data or go out to eat online, and it’s hard to offshore, outsource or automate restaurant work. Amazon’s rise means traditional ground floor retail is being replaced by restaurants with increased frequency. Data to back this up shows 10% of employable people in the US work in the industry. Restaurants now account for 50% of every food dollar spent. 2015 will be the first year restaurant spending exceeds grocery spending. We’ve built a 2-sided, mobile marketplace where restaurants can directly access, search, and recruit candidates. Candidates can create professional profiles, view jobs, assess quality of employers, interact with hirers, and apply for positions or be recruited by our restaurants through the platform.  Successful restaurant employment and hiring prioritizes personality and soft skill before experience and technical ability. We inverted the traditional resume to create candidate profiles focusing on personality, interest, and preferred work environment followed by work experience and education. Restaurants in turn answer what is compelling about working for them before adding key information about position, location, etc. We’ve then built an intuitive system to power automated matching of candidates and employers. Clothbound users can tell the app exactly what they are looking for in their next job/employee, instantly view the results, take their desired action, and save the search to receive automatic updates as new matches become available. For restaurants, Clothbound reduces the time and cost to hire, and leads to better job fit and reduced turnover. For candidates, Clothbound provides a simple, yet powerful tool for finding the right restaurant job and getting hired.","Administrative Services, Apps, Food and Beverage, Internet Services, Professional Services, Software",1,Drew Lewis,1-10,1,,,,,,USD,,MassChallenge,,1,,Private,,,,,,

Experts in hail and storm damage, Bend Roofing Service  professionals will go up on the roof to check out each shingle to make sure that all damage is assessed for insurance claims. A shingle may appear to be slightly affected, but the small displacement of the shingle granules can develop into a damaged shingle with exposure to sun and weather. We can assist you when you are dealing with insurance adjusters, as with roofing claims filing the insurance papers correctly can be tricky. If you have wooden shingles, correct maintenance can extend the life of your roof by several years. Our roofers are qualified to provide roof repairs for all types of shingles, roof panels, and roofing materials. We can handle any type of residential and commercial roofing; no roof is to small or bit for us. Water pouring from your roof? We can repair or replace your gutters and downspouts to protect your foundation. If you have a leaky roof, we locate the origin of the leak and eliminate it. We  can also repair or replace your roof flashing or repair your chimney. Evaluating your roof and assessing damages can be difficult for inexperienced roofers. Many roofing contractors will even try to give you an assessment without getting on the roof. Guided by engineers over the years, our trained professionals know how to determine the difference between storm-related damages, poor workmanship from prior repairs or a manufacturer defect. Our roofers will give you an honest assessment, estimate and/or advice explaining each detail clearly. Bend Roofing Service provides premier roofing service at affordable rates to Bend, Oregon as well as Sisters, Redmond and the surrounding areas. It is your industry leader in the residential/commercial roofing industry. With years of local experience, you can be confident that we will complete each project with the utmost quality with excellent results. Bend Roofing Service’s elite roofers are licensed, bonded and insured guaranteeing smoother transactions and customer safety and satisfaction.
