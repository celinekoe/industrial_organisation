To date, they have closed over 15,000 septal defects worldwide. Ultrasept, their latest family of products, serves as their 7th generation of septal closure devices. The dual articulating sails allow for easy deployment of the devices and create a super low profile within the atria. Ultrasept devices boast a simple, hands-free loading feature and are fully retrievable before and after release. Ultrasept products include double-round devices for the percutaneous closure of both PFO’s (Patent Foramen Ovale) and ASD’s (Atrial Septal Defect). A septal occluder is a cardiac implant that fixes a cardiac defect commonly referred to as a “hole in the heart."" Our devices are delivered through a catheter by an interventional cardiologist and only take about 30 minutes to the implant. Many patients are admitted to the hospital in the morning and return home that afternoon or the next day without the lengthy recovery periods often needed after open-heart surgery. The market for their septal occluder products revolves around the need to close or fix a number of both pediatric and adult cardiac defects. The PFO (Patent Foramen Ovale) defect appears to occur in approximately 25% of the adult population. Most people have no symptoms and therefore require no treatment; however, it is now believed that about 250,000-1,000,000 cases worldwide per year may require closure. These people initially experience a cryptogenic stroke and upon follow-up with their neurologists are revealed to have a PFO defect. If the defect is not closed, these patients are subject to repeated strokes. Similarly, ASD’s (Atrial Septal Defect) appear in approximately 100,000-150,000 cases per year worldwide. Over time, if the defect is left unrepaired, serious cardiac problems can arise. Another possible application for the Ultrasept PFO devices is with regards to the relationship between PFO’s and migraine headaches. Presently it is known that approximately 50% of all migraine sufferers have a PFO. Clinical studies are currently underway to confirm this relationship between PFO’s and migraine headaches.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",1,Joseph Marino,101-250,8,,5492211,USD,5492211,6242211,USD,6242211,,,,,Private,,,,,,

As the CEO of Shipshape Urban Farms, I am committed to leading our company on a path of innovation and growth that reshapes the sustainable farming landscape. In 2023, we are driven by our focus on container gardens, fostering sales and introducing our concept to individuals, families, and businesses alike. The construction of three modular container gardens serves as our hallmark in Birmingham, Alabama, where innovation meets reality, generating a substantial $45K per month in revenue. This landmark achievement is only the beginning. We are excited to pilot partnerships with esteemed grocery store chains, nearby restaurants, and bustling farmers markets, cementing our place as pioneers in sustainable agriculture. Looking ahead to 2024, we will embark on a journey of growth and investment. Our aim is to raise $10 million, propelling us toward the creation of our first HAB in Huntsville, Alabama, a 3D-printed marvel. Simultaneously, we will expand our contracts with grocery stores, working tirelessly to secure our position as a leading supplier of fresh, locally grown produce. The path to our goal is paved with essential milestones: completing carbon capture testing with the National Carbon Center, forging impactful collaborations with NASA, signing contracts for five new Container Gardens, and realizing the completion of our Birmingham Farm. Partnerships for the construction of our HABs are instrumental in our progress, amplifying our vision and reach. With our sights set on 2025, we plan to raise a combination of VC and/or bank loans $200 million to construct 20 new HABs across the United States and strategic locations worldwide. Our partnerships with grocery stores flourish, and we will expand our impact and influence on the food industry. We anticipate the launch of our inaugural project with NASA and Above Space, a testament to our prowess in innovation and cutting-edge technology. By signing contracts for 45 new Container Gardens, we will make a resounding statement about the future of sustainable agriculture. After celebrating a full year of operation for our Huntsville HAB, our vision will extend to new revenue streams, including the sale of HABs to third parties, carbon capture endeavors, and a promising collaboration with NASA in the realm of space. By 2026, our focus shifts toward operating with precision and excellence, optimizing every facet of our endeavors. This sets the stage for 2027, when we embark on the next phase of our journey: the pursuit of an exit strategy that honors our mission, our investors, and our relentless pursuit of redefining urban farming. Together, with a dedicated team and steadfast commitment to sustainability and innovation, we at Shipshape Urban Farms are on a mission to cultivate a greener, more nourished future for all. Our container gardens, HABs, and pioneering partnerships are but the beginning of a groundbreaking era in sustainable agriculture.

We have several medical device products in the pipeline and offer our research & development expertise in assay development and clinical biomarker measurement, with an emphasis on oxidative stress and nitric oxide signaling. With the advent of biomarker analysis for monitoring disease severity and progression (airway inflammation, lung function) there is a desire to shift towards remote patient monitoring via non-invasive biomarkers to improve treatment plans and lower overall costs on the healthcare system. Our initial programs are focused on asthma, COPD, and hypertension. Our breath analysis product, The BioSense AMD (Airway Monitoring Device), provides a ‘window into the lung’ by measuring oxidative stress biomarkers in exhaled breath condensate (EBC). Our test requires no complicated breathing maneuvers, allowing reliable at-home monitoring. These frequent, objective measurements of lung function offer significant patient benefits, provide physicians a tool to optimize treatment, and enable researchers to stratify patients in clinical trials to better understand chronic respiratory disease states. Our blood analysis product measures nitric oxide and nitrative stress metabolites in the blood using a simple finger-prick test.

To support and ultimately ensure delivery of business-critical applications and services, a distinct architecture has emerged. This complex structure involves dynamic resource sharing over a hyper-converged compute, storage and network physical infrastructure, all supported by a layer of virtualization technologies. This new, integrated approach to data center architecture offers tremendous operational and business advantages to organizations whose success is dependent upon reliable application service delivery. However, data center monitoring solutions and technology developments have not kept pace with this new wave in data center architecture. Current tools have reinforced the established silos that separate applications, virtual infrastructure, and physical infrastructure as well as the supporting IT teams within the data center. As a result, data center teams have no inter-silo visibility and are unable to efficiently connect the dots between infrastructure and application performance. Uila has a transformational vision that addresses this problem, and empowers data center infrastructure and application teams with a revolutionary new collaborative solution that effectively visualizes and automatically correlates application performance to virtual and physical infrastructure root cause. Monitoring application and IT infrastructure in a virtualized data center calls for an equally virtualized monitoring architecture. The Uila vision completely transforms data center monitoring with a game-changing approach that leverages virtualization technology. The advanced Uila solution delivers faster and more accurate identification of application performance root cause, provides effective remediation, and prevents future performance degradation…while reducing IT total cost of ownership.","Hardware, Information Technology, Software",3,"Chia Chee Kuan, Dean Au, Miles Wu",11-50,2,,5000000,USD,5000000,5000000,USD,5000000,TOYO Corporation,1,1,,Private,,,,,,
