But more than that, it incorporates citation analysis right into the results, so you can see which cases are most cited.  The service also allows customized results -- users can sort results in a dozen ways to emphasize what's important to them. The service is also the first to move legal research beyond the tired ""search-results-document"" paradigm, with cool data visualization tools that create beautiful, four-dimensional maps of search results.  The most important cases jump off the pages in these maps -- just one of many interesting tools that make Fastcase a smarter alternative for legal research. This is a paradigm shift.  In the past, the emphasis in legal research was on taxonomic or editorial tools that helped lawyers or legal researchers find the most important cases, kind of like Yahoo's categories helped people find pages on the early Web.  Fastcase allows users to organize the law with search tools and intelligent algorithms, much like Google did on the Web.  And like Google, once people use Fastcase's search tools, they find it difficult to go back to the old, pre-chewed editorial indexes of traditional legal research.","Data and Analytics, Design, Information Technology, Internet Services, Professional Services, Software",2,"Ed Walters, Philip Rosenthal",101-250,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,7,Private,,,,,,

Although his symptoms were gone, the physical act of standing or walking left him wide awake.  Dr. Burbank postulated that a device providing counterstimulation, while in bed, would relieve his symptom and allow him to quickly return to sleep.

Polku – International Start-Up dubbed ""Spotify of Fitness"" from top European financial publication.  What is Polku? For consumers Polku is a personalized fitness concierge service. They match great products / services to you and provide trials of services you'll love. Select a package and receive up to 4 passes per month. Polku works with an updated subscription model where users pay $8.99 or $14.99 a month. Additionally they've released the first version of Polku  , which has tripled user adoption by allowing people to follow where their friends are getting fit, ""gift"" passes to friends for free, find friends with the same passes, review feedback, plan events, and much more.  The new ""want it"" feature allows users to request activities that their friends have tried. “The idea here is to find mutual fitness interests with your friends by discovering what they're trying and what they like” Co-Founder Niko Karstikko. Polku is also a great way for prospective service providers to showcase their product before opening their new facility.  To these prospective service providers they provide a list with a number of customers and their demographics that have clicked “want” on their business.  For Partners Polku is the first platform built to drive health and wellness product trials to the right consumers and turn these experiences into new business, recommendations and reviews. This exciting new branding opportunity is being utilized by their partners to attract new pre-qualified customers to their facilities with zero effort and no out of pocket costs. Unlike the daily deal business they provide a continuous stream of pre-qualified leads to their partners. They also have a complete understanding of their members, which enables them to remove all activity pricing from their application. Their partners will never be advertised with 75% off coupons nor will their service ever be devalued like most daily-deal applications. Their users experiencing these new activities know they can afford the service being offered based on their profile submitted at sign-up.   The company recently engaged in a  €200,000 project by Tekes, the Finish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation to continue development of their ""proprietary matching intelligence"". Amazon does it for products, Spotify does it for Music, and it’s their mission to provide this to the health and fitness sector.  Polku is live in Helsinki with over 70 Partners and thousands of users. “They are rapidly acquiring new partnerships everyday in Manhattan and the surrounding boroughs in preparation for their New York City Launch”  - Co-founder Trevor Ferguson.

It claims to be the first and only online information source designed to provide complete transparency into overseas suppliers. According Jeff Silberman, chair of the department of textile development and marketing at New York's Fashion Institute of Technology ""Panjiva is not just innovative, it's revolutionary""[1] By collecting market data from suppliers, Panjiva is also able to produce details of trends within sectors. Information published by Panjiva has been used by news websites such as FT.com[2] and CNNMoney.com[3]. Founding Josh Green was working at an electronics company in Summer of 2005 when he was asked to find a replacement for one of the company's existing suppliers. ""Naively, I thought this would be easy"" said Panjiva co-founder Green, ""but I soon discovered two things. First, that there is no shortage of information about companies on the web. And second, that almost none of it is either objective or useful in identifying trustworthy suppliers. When I talked the problem over with my MIT friend Jim Psota, Panjiva was born."" Naming Panjiva started out with the name ""GlobalReferenceCheck,"" but sensing that a new name might simplify branding and marketing, co-founders Green and Psota played on Pangaea, the word for the supercontinent that existed before the component continents were separated into their current configuration, to arrive at Panjiva.","Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Internet Services, Transportation",2,"James Psota, Josh Green",11-50,3,M&A,5600000,USD,5600000,5600000,USD,5600000,"Battery Ventures, Harrison Metal, Techammer",,3,,Private,,,,,,
