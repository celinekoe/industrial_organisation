They’ve been watching the personal audio industry for years, researching and analyzing everything from the types of music people listen to, how and where they listen, and, most importantly, the quality of audio that they’ve become accustomed to. What they’ve seen has excited, confused, and disappointed us, all at once. Portable audio has revolutionized the way they listen to music, and has transformed the types of products they use. Smartphones and the introduction of music streaming services have made music available to anyone, anytime, anywhere. There are a lot of fashion-oriented headphones and audio players out there. Most sound mediocre, are built like dollar store toys, or are just way, way too expensive. But… There can be no denying that the quality of what they hear when they plug earbuds into their phones is not what they really feel like they should be hearing, and it certainly doesn’t make us feel the same way they feel when they hear live music, or listen to it on a high quality sound system. Or all three. They’ve founded Echobox to help personal audio evolve to a level that does justice to good music. They plan on making good sounding audio products that are well-built and available at prices that are affordable to anyone who is passionate about music. Their first two products, the Explorer and the Finder, are designed to make real high-fidelity audio affordable. In November 2015, they launched a campaign on the crowdfunding website IndieGoGo with the hopes of raising $25,000 to finish the production of their HiFi audio player, the Explorer. With the amazing support of nearly 400 backers, they ended up raising over $70,000! This incredible success has allowed us to move forward even faster with their development, and the Explorer is on track to be finished and market ready by April, 2016. In the meantime, they have delivered (on time) all Finder earphones backed during the initial campaign, and have received overwhelmingly positive feedback about their sound, design and build quality. T could not be any happier! They founded this company because of their love for music, and that passion has pushed us to have plans beyond just making these products. They are a company with a global vision ; a vision of a future where everyone can appreciate music the way it’s meant to be appreciated, both by listening and playing. They want to use their products, and all of their resources, to spread the love of music to as many people as possible!","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio, Software",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Since then, SeamlessWeb has become the industry leader in online food ordering, processing almost 1.5 million orders per month, and now services over 3,500 clients, 3,000 restaurant partners and over 500,000 individual users in cities throughout the U.S. and London. Users enter their address and SeamlessWeb returns a list of restaurants that will deliver to the submitted address. Users then select a restaurant, create an order from the online menu, and submit the order electronically by entering their credit card or a company billing code. Ratings, reviews, photos, tags, and other information is provided to help the user find the most appropriate meal. SeamlessWeb does not prepare or deliver any food. Once a user submits an order, it is automatically sent to a dedicated computer terminal or fax machine at the restaurant. The restaurant confirms the order with SeamlessWeb and then prepares and delivers the order. At many restaurants, users also have the option to pick up their meals from the restaurant. The ordering process works in the same way, except that the user goes to the restaurant for his food instead of having the food delivered.","Apps, Commerce and Shopping, Food and Beverage, Mobile, Platforms, Software",2,"Jason Finger, Kenny Herman",101-250,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Through our educational resources, we strive to educate the public on sleep apnea, its iterations, symptoms, risk factors and treatments. And through our quarterly ADA-approved, CE-qualified Sleep Apnea Seminars and online educational portal Practice Profit , we empower dentists to successfully and profitably implement dental sleep treatment in their practices. 90% Of Sleep Apnea Sufferers Are Untreated There are currently an estimated 22 million Americans with sleep apnea of which only 10% have been diagnosed and are receiving treatment. When you consider that the consequences of untreated sleep apnea are high blood pressure, depression, anxiety, moodiness, extreme fatigue and an increased risk of stroke and heart attack, it becomes evident that this sleeping disorder is a national health crisis that needs greater attention and focus from both physicians and dentists. Greater Sleep Apnea Awareness Through Education The International Academy of Sleep believes that by providing dentists with the training and education they need, not only in the screening and Treatment of Sleep Apnea through oral appliances, but also in the business and marketing strategies necessary for successful practice implementation, more and more patients can receive the treatment they need to enjoy a much better quality of life. The treatment of snoring and sleep apnea is one of the fastest-growing fields of dentistry and yet it is virtually untapped, because the current model for patient screening is so incredibly selective! This is why the International Academy of Sleep has endeavored to spread the importance of incorporating sleep treatment into the standard services of any dental practice. The potential for increased patient intake and revenue makes it an extremely profitable enterprise, but the ultimate payoff is helping the millions of patients that didn’t even know they had a problem in the first place to markedly improve their quality of life.
