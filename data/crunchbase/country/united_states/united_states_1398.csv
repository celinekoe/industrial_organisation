The goal was to provide state-of-the art medical care in a patient-friendly environment. Along the way, Dr. Morgentaler’s research in the areas of testosterone, erectile dysfunction, prostate disease, and infertility has transformed the field of men’s health. Today, Men’s Health Boston is a four-physician practice with a robust clinical research program. The physicians at MHB are regarded as thought leaders in the field of men’s sexual health, participating as faculty at national and international scientific meetings and courses, providing expert opinions at meetings of the Food and Drug Agency, training residents and fellows, and publishing research in peer-reviewed journals. Several advances in medical care were provided first at MHB before being adopted around the world, such as the use of testosterone therapy in men with prostate cancer. The physicians at MHB have been among the first in the US to offer a number of new therapies, such as implantable testosterone pellets and collagenase injections for Peyronie’s disease. In November 2014 Men’s Health Boston entered its next phase by moving its offices into a new, state-of-the-art clinical space at Chestnut Hill Square, in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts.

They also offer their Conflict Minerals Reporting Template, which helps companies disclose and communicate about smelters in their supply chains, and they produce white papers and guidance documents on responsible conflict minerals sourcing and reporting on a regular basis. Over 200 companies and associations from seven different industries participate in the CFSI today, and they regularly collaborate with other complimentary programs and initiatives in this area. They also run a twice-yearly Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative Workshop, which brings together hundreds of representatives from industry, government and civil society for updates, in-depth discussions and guidance on best practices on responsible mineral sourcing.

The platform also dramatically reduces time to locate, both, credible scholarship and experts within a field of research. Academic Room was a finalist in 2012 Massachusetts Innovation and Technology Exchange (MITX) Awards and 2013 EdTech Digest Awards Program for its ability to harness and broker resources and talent across its open communities. Academic Room is headquartered in the Harvard Innovation Lab. Access to educational knowledge, along with the process of its discovery, is an intractable problem, resulting in 3.7 billion related searches every month. ""Researchers—be they senior scholars or freshmen—no longer make the library the first stop in their search for knowledge. The shift from producing and consuming information in hard copy to multimedia digital form has moved the center of information gravity from research libraries to the Internet."" Search engine algorithms rank content that has gone through search engine optimization (SEO) making it more difficult to find more specific high quality academic content. To make matters worse, academic content is becoming increasingly complex and varied, posing an enormous challenge to organize it within traditional web portals. Given these limitations, not surprisingly, the delivery of content occurs haphazardly through disparate websites that often have little to do with education. For instance, today’s students and professors must scour library catalogs for books; video sites for lectures; journal databases for articles and reviews; job boards for career opportunities; and search engines for content such as bibliographies, data sets, lecture notes, syllabi and past exams. As research increasingly becomes interdisciplinary, there is a pressing need for a platform that is social and facilitates both permanent curation and discovery of knowledge. Academic Room’s knowledge management capabilities bring order to this chaos by providing the technology and semantic framework to organize content—in all its complexity—into well-defined subject areas. Because raw and published content is no longer scattered, but rather curated in one central location within specialized social communities on the platform, there emerge a number of opportunities to build a meaningful ecosystem of services around academic disciplines. For instance, Columbia University's Center for Development Economics and Policy (CDEP) uses Academic Room to curate working papers, journal articles and events for its global audience of thought leaders. CDEP also runs a multi-author blog on Academic Room.  Similarly, faculty from Harvard University use Academic Room to engage with industry and announce new projects. Academic Room provides single-search discovery of relevant content in all formats (article, book, review, video, audio, image, bibliography, syllabus, dissertation, manuscript) to granular levels. By adding a social networking layer to the platform, content producers and consumers—whether institutions or individuals—are able to create their profiles, dynamically update content they have authored, and engage with other users in discussion groups and blogs. Academic Room was conceived as a content platform with the larger vision of collaboration in mind from its very inception because other existing solutions are mere social networks that lack the capability to create structured repositories of knowledge.","Education, Software",1,Sarabjot Kaur,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Studies show that the overwhelming majority of this work falls on women. On average, women perform 2.5 times more daily caregiving work than men. The pandemic has made this problem glaringly clear with nearly 3 million women pushed out of the paid workforce. An unequal division of household labor contributes to poor maternal mental health, destroys relationships, and is the primary driver of the gender wage gap. Solution Tend: Task Manager & Journal is a free tracking app for moms that delivers knowledge, confidence, self-worth, and understanding by tracking the invisible labor of motherhood . Tend makes invisible labor visible, so it can be shared and valued. Competition No other tech company is focusing on invisible, unpaid labor. Women are typically cobbling together various products to help them understand and communicate about the work they do to care for their families. They may use spreadsheets or pencil and paper to track their unpaid work or use other productivity apps like Cozi or Todoist to attempt to share the work with their partners and family members. These methods require a great deal of time and mental energy from women and don’t acknowledge or value much of the invisible work necessary to keep a family running smoothly.  Market Our primary market is the 22-25M millennial mothers in the US and Canada. 43% of them have opted out of the paid workforce, and many more have taken less demanding, part-time jobs to compensate for the heavy burden of childcare. Forbes estimates the total FamTech market at $46B. Using our understanding of the market and a conservative estimate of LTV, we calculate a top down TAM of $19.8B and a bottom up TAM of $5.38B. Business Model Targeted Advertising and Brand Partnerships - we have an opportunity to provide users with targeted ads and product placements at the moment women are considering their pain points. Premium Subscriptions - Tend for couples provides an advanced technology solution to navigating shared caregiving.

Crcl,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/crcl,"Android, Apps, Communities, Education, iOS, Location Based Services","South Bend, Indiana, United States",Crcl is a community-based recommendation app that empowers you to do what you love. ,"811,698","Great Lakes, Midwestern US",Less than $1M,Active,2016-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,http://crclapp.com,"Crcl (pronounced “circle”) has been different from the start. Founder, Chas Pulido, formed the idea for Crcl following his senior year of high school, just over two years ago.  The journey began in March of 2015 when Chas discovered a lump in his upper arm that was later identified as a tumor. Chas experienced a mortality check at a young age, and suddenly was met with many uncertainties. Luckily, after months of monitoring, the tumor was ruled benign; the lessons he learned, however, are still with him. Following his experience, Chas gained a new understanding for the importance and value of time. He wanted to ensure that other people have positive experiences with the time they have, and not waste it. With that vision in mind, Chas began searching. Chas and a team conducted a company analysis of Yelp. He recognized several flaws in their platform: a lack of trust between users, no incentive to review following an experience, review biases, and the absence of a social community. Chas envisioned Crcl as a solution to these problems.  Crcl is a recommendation platform at heart, but it goes far beyond just providing reviews. Crcl aims to cater to your preferences through its unique crowdsourcing feature that centers around affinity groups. By offering dedicated forums for users to connect and post about the activities they love, Crcl helps provide reviews like never before. Crcl combines improved individual profiles and a proprietary rating system to create an engaging social community. Whether you want to go out to eat, see a movie, or go for a hike, Crcl helps you find the best option. It empowers people to go out into the world and experience the things they love. Our goal is to offer a platform that caters to individual interests, is user friendly, visually appealing, and quick to use. The mission of Crcl is to foster a community built around people, places, and knowledge. By creating a platform centered around the user, Crcl aspires to facilitate recommendations of the highest quality, connect users to positive experiences, and promote the growth of businesses.  At 18 years old, Chas stepped foot onto the University of Notre Dame’s campus determined to find a team to make his dream possible.  As the concept continued to develop, the Crcl team grew quickly. Chas recruited fellow Notre Dame students who share their passion and want to make a difference. Crcl is built around the tagline “Do What You Love”. According to founder Chas Pulido, “By each of us pursuing our passions, we empower our users to do the same. This passion drives us every day and is what brought us together. It is a special thing to be able to say you do what you love, with the people you love”. Today, Crcl Inc. is comprised of 10 members that make up its three teams: Growth Science, Marketing, and Product Development. We are proud to say now that after a couple years, our team of full-time college students has taken this project from ideation to launch. Over the past few months, our concept has been refined and validated through testing and focus groups. The team is finalizing development and looking forward to sharing Crcl with the world in February 2018. The Crcl team is currently in the fundraising process, seeking resources from both Venture Capitalists and Angels. More information can be found on our website, http://crclapp.com/.

The Herald strives to present objective news, entertaining sports and arts coverage and insightful editorial stances that reflect the interests and tastes of UW-Madison’s student community. In the process, we also hope to train the next generation of student journalists for success in any of life’s paths. We are a family, dedicated and enthusiastic. As we pursue our goals, we invite you to join us by writing a letter, purchasing an ad, applying for a job or just taking the time to read the paper, online and off.","Content and Publishing, Education, Media and Entertainment",,,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
