We selectively breed two to four litters annually and have successfully placed over 400 puppies in loving Florida homes. We are proud to report that we have never had a puppy or adult dog returned due to a health issue. Despite the high incidence of cancer in American Goldens, which is over 50%, we have had only one incidence of cancer in our lines. The overall rate of health issues for Paradise Golden Retrievers is less than 1%, and any issues have been correctable. We attribute this to our selective breeding practices and utilization of English Golden Retriever lines. Since 2005, we have been finding loving family homes for our ""Puppies from Paradise"" all over Florida. Our puppies and dogs have been placed in Tallahassee, Jacksonville, Orlando, the Florida Keys, Miami, Naples, Sarasota, and, of course, our local Tampa Bay area. Our location in Valrico, next to Brandon, is convenient for most families looking to add a Golden puppy to their lives. Recently, we have opened a second kennel on a restored, historic plantation outside of Raleigh, North Carolina, situated on 300 acres and just 30 minutes west of Greenville. Melissa Coleman, M.Ed., has been a special education teacher for 25 years before retiring and starting Paradise Golden Retrievers. She has been passionate about the breed for over 40 years, ever since hunting the fields of rural Pennsylvania with her father and experiencing the obedience and agility of a highly-skilled hunting Golden. She has been fortunate enough to witness a wide range of Golden Retriever activities, from their excellence in retrieving in the field and stream to being beloved family companions, as well as obedient and sensitive therapy and service dogs. Melissa comments, ""Goldens have such huge hearts; they are also very intuitive and have an enormous desire to please their owners."" Her goal is to share the joy that Goldens bring with others who also value and love the breed. For many people purchasing a puppy, they have previously owned a Golden and require little introduction to their unique qualities. To these people, we say, ""Welcome back to the wonderful world of Goldens!"" For those new to the breed, you are in for a treat with Golden Retrievers! They enrich lives in countless ways with their fun-loving, ball-retrieving, and water-loving personalities. Their constant Golden ""smile"" is a trademark!",,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
