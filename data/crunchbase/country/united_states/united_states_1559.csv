Our flagship product, the MIMIR Blockchain to Internet (B2i) Bridge, brings blockchain to the “off-chained” by allowing direct access to the Decentralized Application ecosystem from any web connected device without the need for third-party trust; with limited or, in some cases, no pre-installed software necessary. By leveraging existing nodes, the MIMIR Bridge can help B2B and B2C clients improve economics and smooth capacity issues. This innovative approach will also address current issues with blockchain (namely security, scalability, and accessibility). The MIMIR B2i Token, the value mechanism behind the MIMIR B2i Bridge solution, will go beyond the cloud and traditional Blockchain as a Service (Baas) offerings. Our token is truly the first of its kind. In exchange for cryptocurrency, users will be given a small amount of MIMIR B2i tokens that will act as its own piece of infrastructure. Thus our B2I tokens, which can be used to actively participate on the network, become a steady source of revenue for holders. 	 While there is potential for penetration of the business to consumer (B2C) market, MIMIR sees business to business (B2B) as a larger market for growth (Frost & Sullivan, estimates best B2B e-commerce is set to reach $6.7 trillion by 2020). MIMIR is actively pursuing case study partners with Dapp developers and web API’S. These markets are in need of infrastructure solutions to satisfy the demand for nodes, which presently out-paces supply by an internal estimates of 48,248%.  We believe our B2i technology can be seen in many areas of modern business, including but not limited to: Identity Protection  Car sharing  Augmented Reality  Business Preservation/Expansion Asset Tracking/Supply Chain (Natural Disaster Relief/Humanitarian Efforts) Secure Fund Transfer MIMIR will have a live alpha test beginning early January 2018. Our Token sale will launch in Q1 of 2018. It is our expectation to have multiple case study partners by mid-2018, and an active beta version of the MIMIR B2i product ready for commercialization in late 2018.","Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Information Technology, Other, Software",3,"Forrest Marshall, Hunter Prendergast, Nicolas Fierro",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
