The industry provides the ability to achieve very large profits with a quick turn to profitability. 2014 is projected to produce $8.8 billion in small business loans with an increase to $870 billion of funded loans by 2025 which equates to a stellar 258% year-over-year increased growth rate. Small Business loans are small short term loans with a 3 to 6 month duration to solve an immediate cash need for the business owners. Fees and loan rates can range from 3% to 5% per month with a 1% to 2.5% origination fee. Loan application is a simple 10 minute process. Target Business Capital(TBC) can connect small businesses with non traditional funding products in 24 hours or less. Loan are similar to prime credit and loan amounts will range from $5,000 to $100,000. Payments on the loan will be automatically debited directly from the customers bank account. Loans are generally collateralized by a personal guarantee or UCC filing. Currently 92% of all small businesses are unable to borrow money. Small businesses struggle with cash flow needs and lack the necessary cash to make investments to further grow their business. Seeking capital from a traditional bank is nearly nonexistent. TBC is not a newcomer to the online lending industry. The ownership and management team have 8 years of online lending experience. A huge differentiating factor for TBC is that it holds ownership to its own proprietary loan processing software and lead generation technology that is currently in operation. This alone lowers operational cost and adds in credible intrinsic value to TBC upon sale of the company.",Other,,,,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
