Parlaying early success at getting live images off yachts in the Sydney to Hobart race, the idea emerged to apply the technology to auto racing. The challenges were substantial, but the successes were compelling enough to catch the eye of a CBS executive who saw it as a perfect fit for the emerging NASCAR series. After a number of years of traveling back and forth between Australia and the US, this renegade group of entrepreneurs saw the market potential for these new systems in the US, picked up stakes and established Broadcast Sports Technologies (BST) in 1983. Over the course of the next 25 years, BST secured the reputation as the ""go-to"" provider of wireless point of view systems. This attention and the growing contracts surrounding our technologies allowed the development of small, rugged and more highly customized systems.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Information Technology, Media and Entertainment, Sports, Video",,,51-100,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Bern Mutia, with the help of Rama Bollu and Avery Keyes created the GreenFuelBooster, a Platinum-anode-based electrolysis device to generate hydrogen from water and improve fuel burn. As the project required engine data monitoring, a Java application was developed to monitor OBD2 parameters affecting fuel burn. Presently, this application has been developed to a full web-enabled platform to do predictive trend diagnostics in cars. It has opened the possibility of cars as social entities by allowing it to communicate back to their vehicle owners and their Trusted Mechanics. The car’s engine data is its digital signature. This vision has come true with the help of bluetooth-enabled OBD2 plugins and data loggers in smartphones. Cars can now be better understood which only a few years ago was only within the realm of auto mechanics. Their platform hopes to help the ordinary consumer to save money by prolonging the lifetime of cars and hopefully encourage them to be responsible stewards of the environment.
