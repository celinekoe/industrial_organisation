Its primary	product was the Collens Sphygmo-Oscillometer, a blood pressure measuring instrument, used to assist a physician in diagnosing peripheral vascular deficiencies. In the 1940's UMA, Inc. diversified its business by developing aircraft instruments for the war effort.  In 1974 the company was purchased by three engineers from Grumman Aircraft Company. By 1985 one principal owner, Mr. Awad Da'Mes, had purchased total interest in the company and still retains ownership today. During the 1970's and early 1980's, the company made instruments for the Aircraft manufactures of Piper, Cessna, and Beech with considerable success. In 1978 the company moved to Elkton, Virginia to take advantage of business incentives. Since then, due to new manufacturing space requirements, the company moved to its current location in Dayton, Virginia. The company now maintains 7,500 square feet manufacturing space which is large enough to accommodate 3 times current production. Through the years UMA's aircraft instrumentation sales have grown  to represent 75% of total sales. During the last decade, UMA's sales have shifted to the growing ""homebuilt"" segment of the market. The Company's products are sold and appreciated both domestically and internationally.  UMA has an excellent Research, Development, and Engineering staff which continually strives to not only meet the demands of advancing Aviation and Medical technologies, but also to custom develop products for customers.

The value of education has long been widely acknowledged, and perhaps never more so than in this age of information and global connectivity, where education, knowledge, and the intellectual fitness they bring, make life better. Throughout much of the world, the importance of physical fitness has become widely accepted as well. They know that they will live better if they exercise, eat right, sleep well, and make healthy choices in their everyday lives. They seek to add to the focus on a fit mind and body the additional definition of “inner fitness,” meaning the awareness of the self inside that mind and body, and “relational fitness,” representing the life skills to build trusted relationships with others in authentic and meaningful ways. They define inner fitness as being self aware and having the self knowledge to make sound and informed decisions that enable us to be the best people they can be. With that foundation, they add relational fitness – the social awareness and the authentic relationship skills to offer support and strength to others, to listen deeply, and to enter into dialogue that unlocks the potential within each of us as individuals and community members. This vision of inner and relational fitness defines the two wings of their purpose at 1440 – the belief that, with practice and support, they can build richer and more meaningful lives based on a commitment to fitness within, throughout, and across theirselves. They are excited by the further belief that this is not mystical or abstract, but achievable in very practical terms, teachable and realizable with support and practice. The importance of such whole person fitness is equal to the importance they ascribe to physical fitness today and, in their experience, it is easier to do!","Other, Social Impact",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

In the highly competitive institutional asset management business, investors have come to rely on Longbow Research for their  commitment to their success. First, they provide unique insights and primary data on specific companies, supply channels and industries. These unique insights are gathered in-house through more than 100 periodical market surveys, supply channel checks, retail polls and an extensive network of industry contacts. Thorough work at this level allows us to identify key trends as well as potential catalysts. Longbow Research was established in 2003 to provide the institutional equity research market with a high quality, independent product, free from the many conflicts of interest that plagued bulge-bracket research at that time. Initially, the firm consisted only of analysts producing in-depth research on a short list of companies. In 2004, Longbow Research hired its first salespeople and also established an agency-only trading desk to facilitate client payment for the research. While this marked the beginning of their sell-side business model, they have strived to maintain their buy-side stock-picking research culture. Today, Longbow Research has moved beyond the start-up phase and is growing rapidly. They have opened offices in New York City and San Francisco and have also established an international research survey offering to cover a number of important supply channels in Europe, Latin America and Asia. While they have grown from that small group of analysts, they remain committed to their research tools and to their  client's investment success. Second, from this foundational research come actionable ideas. Their  valuation work combined with their  sensitivity to catalysts allow their  industry analysts to develop and advance an investment thesis on each company they cover. They are looking for mis-priced securities and the catalysts that will trigger a correction to fair value.","Financial Services, Professional Services",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

FSMLabs first clock sync technology, released in 2008, provided a microsecond accurate ground up implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) for financial services. TimeKeeper was soon extended to support IEEE 1588 PTP and to offer the first usable protocol independent fault tolerance. Since then FSMLabs innovations have made TimeKeeper the industry standard in financial trading with features like a graphical user interface, easy configuration, analytical capabilities, monitoring, alerting, and most recently, an archiving database to assist in regulatory compliance. TimeKeeper Enterprise Appliance, released in 2011, remains the only hardware network clock that provides sub-microsecond accurate time over both PTP and NTP with native 10Gbps performance. 25Gbps and 100Gbps are also available as is support for GPS and Galileo.","Information Technology, Software",1,Victor Yodaiken,11-50,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

(then named the Rock Island Baking Company) in February 1987, he had no idea that his small company would become the country’s leading producer of Sugar Free and No Sugar Added products. Located in Rock Island, Illinois, The Rock Island Baking Company started out making all kinds of baked goods, but specialized in pies. Some of those pies used alternative sweeteners in their recipes, a very novel idea for the time. George took notice that the pies were taking off and soon the company was renamed Nancy’s Pies in honor of his wife, and also because he claimed “no one would buy George’s Pies!” IMG_7675At the time, Nancy’s Pies was clearly on to something, as few in-store bakeries had the time or the resources to specialize in making bakery-quality Sugar Free desserts for those looking to reduce refined sugar in their diet. Over the years, Nancy’s Pies grew their Sugar Free and No Sugar Added product line immensely, and in 2006 George and Nancy Coin sold the business, creating the Hill & Valley we have come to know. Today, Hill & Valley employs approximately 150 people and is the leading national manufacturer of Sugar Free and No Sugar Added branded items to the In Store Bakery. In 2011, Hill & Valley went through a Re-Launch of our branded Sugar Free and No Sugar Added products, including innovation in packaging and labeling. These innovations have carried over into our Private label business as well, allowing us to strengthen our foundation of excellence in Sugar Free desserts and maintain a leadership position in the industry. IMG_7711Over the past several years, with the hard work of our newly formed Executive Management team and talented Research and Development department, Hill & Valley has been able to create custom products for several major retailers across the nation. Our expansion into the Full Sugar arena has allowed us to become a major player in the Custom Bakery market. Our continued dedication to our GFSI certification and consumer safety has enabled us to create dramatic growth in building upon the previously established Sugar Free and No Sugar Added foundation, and our newfound role in the Custom Bakery market. Hill & Valley products are sold nationwide, primarily through supermarket in-store bakeries. The firm’s customer list includes a majority of the country’s major chains.
