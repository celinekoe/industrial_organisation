The technology allows for antigen-specific stimulation or suppression of a T-helper response to virtually any antigen of known pathogenic potential. Consequential, Antigen Express is building a deep pipeline of therapeutics aimed at a variety of major diseases, including cancer, infectious diseases and autoimmune-based syndromes. Antigen Express therapies are based on highly selective modulation of the immune response, in contrast to most current immunomodulation strategies that are in general non-specific. This lack of specificity is the prime source for unwanted side effects. The therapies developed at Antigen Express intervene at the critical stage of antigen presentation to modulate the immune response. This targeted approach results in a potent up or down regulation of critical members of the immune system. The technologies developed at Antigen Express are novel and highly complementary to existing approaches of immune modification. Therefore, the company is uniquely positioned to develop partnerships where Antigen Express technology enhances or augments the corporate partners’ technology or product portfolios.","Biotechnology, Science and Engineering",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

When an individual switches driver’s seat with another person, it is required that they adjust their mirrors according to the current driver’s road view.

The Solution:  Create a hassle free way to automatically adjust the rear view mirrors in any vehicle based on an individual driver’s posture. The Benefits:  This new technology significantly prevents blind spot related accidents, promoting a safer environment for the driver, passengers as well as anyone else on the road.

Please contact us anytime. We’re here for you! Why we’re here: We’re tired of seeing medical emergencies needlessly escalate from treatable to life-altering.  In a medical emergency, the difference between a good decision and a bad decision isn’t just about life or death. More often, it’s about the difference between a patient being able to get back to their life again or being in recovery for months, years, or even the rest of their lives. With better training, we are fixing this. Passionate, dedicated clinicians make bad decisions every day, unnecessarily harming patients. The third leading cause of death in the United States is preventable medical errors. As many as 440,000 people die each year from preventable medical mistakes. These mistakes deeply affect clinicians and first responders, as well, causing depression, PTSD, and a suicide rate 10 times higher than the general population. With better education, we are changing this. It’s time for a change.
