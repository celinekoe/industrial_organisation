Applications don’t exist in a vacuum – databases, web front ends, networks, external appliances, local support libraries, operating systems – all need to share configuration information and work as a unit for correct application deployment.  Systems that only deal with one component of this application ecosystem add just another disparate piece to an already complex puzzle.  VaraLogix offers a better approach.  We provide the only solution that has been purposely-built, from the ground up, to automate business critical application deployment and configuration management – in one solution – removing risk and uncertainty from the deployment process.  We do it differently.  At a high level, we do it by looking at application deployment from an IT Operations perspective.  This makes us uniquely positioned to bridge the Development / IT Operations gap for agile, secure, scalable operations from development to production. VaraLogix is led by the same experienced team who founded Build Forge, which was acquired by IBM in 2006. Our team has spent decades addressing deployment automation, configuration, and build and release management issues at Global 2000 companies such as Apple, State Farm, All State, Wells Fargo, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, Lockheed Martin and many others.   We have established partnerships with IBM, Microsoft, Redhat, Oracle, Electric Cloud and Software House International and have customers within the Financial Services, Retail, Telecommunications, Entertainment, Travel, Insurance, and Education industries who we are helping to: •	Increase mission critical application quality and uptime •	Accelerate deployment cycles  •	Deploy to any environment – physical, virtual, cloud •	Lower operational costs VaraLogix is privately-held and based in Austin, Texas.  www.varalogix.com","Hardware, Software",3,"Joe Senner, Robin Fuller, Timothy Wall",11-50,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

When they go to their dentist, they are being bombarded with new cavities, deep gum pockets, and other problems. Many have to pay constantly for treatments. Most of the time, patients are only informed that they have cavities and gum disease, rather than how those cavities and gum disease might have occurred.  Denti-Pal aims to solve this problem on how to prevent cavities, maintain healthy gums, and help people take control of their oral health. That way patients can save time, money and preserve their overall oral well being. After all, oral health is the gateway to general health. 1.2. Describe the solution, Denti-Pal:  With Denti-Pal, the focus is on preventing tooth decay and other gum issues through the use of powerful dental products. Denti-Pal takes into account the patient's health history and habits in order to provide them with a diagnosis on how high their cavity and periodontitis risk is. For example, 25% of people between ages 65-69 are taking 5 or more prescription medications. Many of these medications cause xerostomia as a side-effect, which combined with poor habits leads to an extreme risk for developing cavities; most patients do not know their risk is this high. Patients with diabetes are also at high risk for bone loss, which accelerates tooth loss due to gum issues. Denti-Pal is able to calculate the cavity risk level using CAMBRA (developed by UCSF and UOP dental schools) as well as bring gum disease risk awareness.  With this knowledge, patients can get a dental package tailored to their risk level needs. Patients with a higher risk level tend to get cavities due to factors they cannot control (such as genetics) or factors they are unaware of being correlated (such as dry mouth). Denti-Pal addresses these factors directly with the product kit to create an effective solution in preventing cavities, stopping gum disease, and improving oral health. 2. Herbal-Pal <https://www.Herbal-Pal.org> 2.1. What specific problems do Herbal-Pal solve?  2.1.1. Many US patients lack understanding and easy access to traditional medicine. Conventional Western Medicine has limitations in treating disorders requiring a top-down holistic system as well as novel diseases such as COVID-19. 2.1.2. Well trained herbal medicine practitioners, such as traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) doctors, are not allowed to “treat” COVID-19 patients in person by law in the US. Thus, US practitioners with experience healing COVID patients are concerned about legal troubles and do not want to publicize. However, they are willing to work with Herbal-Pal if we protect their licensure/business information, and take care of legal aspects while providing insurance.   2.1.3. Current healthcare system is costly and ineffective in prolonged war with COVID-19. While current mainstream allopathic medicine can solve some health issues, many conditions are still considered ""incurable"" or have “no special treatment”. Take COVID for example, mainstream media is anticipating vaccines to solve all problems, forgetting that vaccines are not for everyone. While early forms of vaccination were documented in 556 A.D., from TCM’s perspective, the immunization process only works for those who are healthy and strong. For those whose immune systems are not up to the extra burden, vaccines can shock the body by introducing “latent evils” and lead to unwanted consequences. 2.1.4. The one-size-fits-all mindset makes public health organizations reactive instead of proactive. They only take conservative, ineffective steps to avoid stepping on too many toes. For example, contrary to our early advocacy, the media and CDC have been changing faces about wearing masks.  2.2. Describe the solution, Herbal-Pal:  Herbal-Pal meets herbal medicine needs all in one spot. Patients are matched (based on specialties, availability, price range, and other nuances such as gender, languages spoken, former patient reviews) with curated traditional medicine doctors for remote consultations. Patients get personalized herbal prescription dispensed or patent formulae fulfilled and delivered anywhere. For those who have access to local herbal medicine doctors or herbs, they can choose to utilize part of Herbal-Pal service. Patients and providers will have a chance to leave multi-dimensional reviews for each other, and the feedback will become part of the underlying database.    The concept of Herbal-Pal is based on traditional medicine, with TCM being extensively used and well-documented among the world's medical traditions (e.g., Kampo in Japan, Ayurveda in India, complementary therapies in Switzerland, etc.). Most of the common health problems and many of the ""incurable"" issues can be treated with traditional medicine. Herbal-Pal currently offers a wide range of TCM doctors. We have seen some negative connotations coming from the media about TCM. In fact, just like how Arabic numbers do not have any political associations with Arabic countries, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is simply a name based on its location of origin. In fact, both traditional and modern medicines are pretty consistent although each has its advantages and limitations.    We believe far more US users can benefit from herbal medicine or the broader traditional medicine. The vision of Herbal-Pal is to become everyone’s personal traditional medicine consultant, like Upwork for herbal/ traditional/ integrative medicine.
