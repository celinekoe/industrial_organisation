Their products allow website publishers to maximize the value of their customer visits using real-time behavioral targeting techniques in order to increase conversion rates and generate greater amounts of revenue. EchoCurrent's first product was released on February 10, 2009 and is called the Affiliate Product Optimizer. By truly listening to website visitorsÃ¢â¬â¢ words and actions, publishers can increase their revenues by optimizing their advertising content in real-time.  The EchoCurrent Affiliate Product Optimizer (or APO) is a widget used by website publishers to display a list of individually relevant and targeted product offers to their visitors. Any commission generated by the products in the APO zone goes directly to the site publisher through their own affiliate network relationship.  EchoCurrent provides tools and reports to monitor the effectiveness of the product offers. To a visitor, an Affiliate Product Optimizer zone appears similar to a Google AdSense advertising box.  EchoCurrent supplies different sized zones as well as configurable styles to match our customersÃ¢â¬â¢ websites.  But unlike Google or Yahoo ads, the content is not based on the context of the page where it sits.  Rather, it is based on the current and recent activity of the visitorÃ¢â¬Â¦their Ã¢â¬ÅEchoÃ¢â¬Â.  Each web page will display product offers that are uniquely relevant to each individual visitor.  The Affiliate Product Optimizer runs on top of the EchoCurrent Customer Intent Engine platform and more products are expected to be released on this platform in the near future.
