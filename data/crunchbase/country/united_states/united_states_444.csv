During his quest to launch a unique business of his own, SmarterLeap Founder and CEO, Jeff Frutkin, found a surprising gap in the entrepreneurial community. While many websites claim to have new business ideas, these sites simply publish existing small businesses or report on ideas that were started by other entrepreneurs. Many of these ideas are recycled from site to site and offer limited revenue potential and competitive advantage, especially to an entrepreneur looking for a new business idea to call his own.  So Jeff did what any good entrepreneur would do. He founded SmarterLeap in 2009 to bridge the gap in the marketplace. The result? A platform specializing in new idea generation:  SmarterLeap's purpose is to provide:  -Breakthrough business ideas for individuals serious about starting a new business, from original web 2.0 sites and unique service businesses to new product innovations.  -Expert guidance to successfully bring a new SmarterLeap business idea to market.  SmarterLeap taps into a network of really smart and creative people (the site calls them Idea Architects) to generate ideas that have yet to be imagined in the world of business. Their proprietary process screens each idea for things like revenue potential, level of investment and uniqueness, among other criteria.  If you are serious about starting your own company and are looking for a compelling idea, SmarterLeap.com is a great resource for you.","Advertising, Commerce and Shopping, Community and Lifestyle, Design, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Other, Professional Services, Sales and Marketing",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
