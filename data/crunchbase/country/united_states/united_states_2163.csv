They simply need to pay attention to their current spending habits and understand the future dollar value of their purchases. Nuvestan is a financial visualization tool that helps you be aware of the actual value of your purchases within a given time. Often, we look at a $4 cup of coffee as a small purchase. However, if you buy a cup of coffee three days a week, those purchases add up not only because of the money you spent but the potential money you missed out on in the stock market. Many budgeting websites show you if you have blown through your budget. We take it a step further.

Even though the symptoms may vary, they are a sign of a serious problem which must be identified and dealt with quickly. Find out more about the main causes of foul smell coming from the air ducts and how to resolve them. Less often, the bad odor can come from gasses which have been released into the air ducts. If the heat exchanger of the HVAC system has a leakage, it will release combustion gasses such as carbon monoxide into the air ducts. These gasses can pose a serious health threat. Action for resolving the problem must be taken immediately. If the structural components and finishes of a building release chemicals in gas form, they can be carried by the HVAC system and their bad smell can come from the air vents. In this case, the dangerous materials must be removed and all surfaces including the walls of the air ducts must be properly cleaned.
