Brandon created the concept to attract new talent to the startup and tech scene in DC, Southern Maryland, and Northern Virginia (often abbreviated NOVA), hence the name DMV. From there, DMV Startup hosted several events related to entrepreneurship, including happy hours and ""Startup BBQ."" On November 25th, 2014, DMV Startup published ""Welcome to the M*****F******* DMV Startup Handbook,"" a Google Doc educating people in the DC Metro area about the local startup/technology landscape. What began as a small project to boost the DC Metro startup scene gained enough recognition to become a small organization. Currently, Brandon and his DMV startup team are curating a wiki website (which hopefully you've noticed...) to showcase local startups, organizations, meetups, influencers, government agencies, and any other relevant resources for the public.  In December of 2014, DMV Startup acquired the event branch of Startup Dynamo, a group that holds lean startup workshops, to further educate and rally the DC metro startup community under the DMV Startup moniker.","Community and Lifestyle, Other, Professional Services, Sales and Marketing",1,Brandon T.

Discreet Drop,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/discreet-drop,"E-Commerce, Shipping, Shopping","Buffalo, New York, United States","Guarantee discreet shipping on any package, from any seller.","2,269,668","Great Lakes, East Coast, Northeastern US",,Closed,2017-01-01,year,,,,none,For Profit,https://discreetdrop.com/,"Discreet Drop is a Buffalo-based startup founded in 2017 by Kevin Skompinski, serving to create a way to make sure that every item people order can arrive to them as discreet as possible. Privacy has become a pseudo-luxury in today's digital age, with any information being available just a simple search way. We've identified this gap in privacy protection with all the information and identifiable logos a shipped box provides to anyone who may see it. Logos, packing slips, and customs forms are obvious clues as to the contents of a package. Even merchants who advertise discreet shipping still have a return label on their packages which lists the seller's name and address; both of which can be quickly Googled to reveal what's in any package. We've realized that if you're not handling your package at all times, your privacy is vulnerable on any shipment. Only the recipient should know what's in their package. With this in mind, we've created Discreet Drop as a solution to cover up those privacy issues, literally. We serve as a shipment processor, where people can ship their packages to us via a unique address, from any online store. We then double-box the package to cover up any external logos, return labels, packing slips, and even holes; anything that can act as identifying information and can be used to signal what's in the box. Finally we ship the plain-box out to the customer so it will arrive completely discreet, and nobody but the customer would be able to figure out what's in the package. Easy. With Discreet Drop, packages will arrive with no logos or branding to attract attention from anyone, reveal the contents of the box, and won't have any identifying information that can be used to figure out is in a package. With Discreet Drop, only the customer will ever know what is in their packages. Discreet Drop is the only way to guarantee 100% discreet shipping on any package, from any seller.","Commerce and Shopping, Transportation",1,Kevin Skompinski,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
