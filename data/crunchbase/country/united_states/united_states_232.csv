Brownie points were an imaginary social currency earned through good deeds done to others. Over the years, a community and cryptocurrency has been established around this idea. Brownie coins were created as a reward system when someone does something deserving a reward. Initially, Brownie points were awarded as novelty points without any monetary value.  Post world war II, brownie stamps were given depending on the purchase of goods. These stamps could later be redeemed for select goods. Brownie stamps or brownie points, were a resemblance of a good deed performed in the society and rewards for purchases made. Brownie points have since carried on to represent a remittance system with a monetary value attached to each coin earned. Brownie coins have established themselves as part of the cryptocurrency and blockchain narrative that forms a significant part of today’s economy. Brownie coins are an opensource digital currency. Instead of awarding someone brownie points with no value, brownie coins now offer a monetary value.  About Armen Merikyan Armen Merikyan grew up in Los Angeles California, a software designer and a crypto currency early adopter. He is the founder of Brownie Coins which is a digital currency platform. He commenced his venture while working in one of the three biggest entertainment studios in LA, such as Walt Disney, Warner Brothers etc... His passion regarding attempting to actualize bitcoin reproduction was complex as he had no insight of the technical world of crypto currency and blockchain technology. He worked in Silicon Valley where he approached numerous individuals to create a model for a given timetable, price and a full operational help group around the product. He secured funding from his parents, family and friends. This seed money assisted him with creating brownie coins as fully developed digital currency.",,1,Armen Merikyan,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
