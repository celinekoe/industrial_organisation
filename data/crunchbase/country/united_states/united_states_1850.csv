The Company was incorporated in 2007 to link emerging technical opportunities in the basic neurosciences to the expanding medical needs of those with neuropsychiatric disease. Operations thus focus on selecting product candidates to license-in, adding value by advancing towards global registration, and licensing-out to commercial partners. There success reflects an exceptional ability to select promising drug candidates, intimate knowledge of the development process as well as our ability to devise the most efficient path to regulatory approval. Since inception, CPC has sought to develop novel compounds that could improve the treatment of AD and related neurodegenerative disorders. Alzheimer’s disease constitutes the largest unmet medical need in neuropsychiatry. No emerging therapies have clearly demonstrated the potential to fulfill this medical need. Symptoms include an increasing loss of memory and other cognitive functions later combined with a variety of neuropsychiatric and behavioral disturbances. Progression is relentless, typically leading to death within 10 to 15 years. AD is now recognized as the third leading killer in the U.S. It is estimated that the 37 million afflicted worldwide cost society over $600 billion annually. As the population ages, this burden will rapidly climb to unsustainable levels. Although US sales of Alzheimer’s disease medications last year topped $4.7 billion, none of the current treatments improve symptoms more than marginally. Moreover, tolerability is poor, dose titration prolonged, and dropout rates high.

This engine is the first of its kind, designed from scratch to achieve the best fuel economy the business has ever seen.  The Graflight V-8’s eight-cylinder, 4-stroke piston engine takes full advantage of the extensive research and development that has elevated automotive diesel engines to the highest standards, incorporating them into an engine designed specifically for general aviation.  It offers incredible advancements in reliability, safety and durability by taking a high-tech approach to the problems commonly found in competitors’ engines and eliminating them through a combination of extremely rugged yet lightweight materials and by employing the most advanced proven automotive techniques for monitoring and controlling engine performance. The Graflight V-8 is unlike anything that has ever been put inside a general aviation airplane and the results can be seen in virtually every aspect of its performance and design. Though it is of comparable weight and size, the Graflight V-8 has shown up to 40 percent fuel savings when matched against comparable turbine engines.  The engine increases range by up to 50 percent or payload by up to 40 percent compared to Avgas-powered aircraft. When compared with other aviation diesels, it is still 15 percent more fuel efficient because unlike those engines, it was built specifically to meet the requirements of flight.  It is also the cleanest and greenest engine ever manufactured for the GA market, cutting CO2 emissions by 30 percent over comparable Avgas engines and by 17 percent over competing diesel engines. In fact, if this engine could be installed in every car in America, it would cut fuel consumption across the board by 30 percent – just imagine!","Professional Services, Science and Engineering",2,"Michael Fuchs, Steven Weinzierl",11-50,10,,38179592,USD,38179592,40677092,USD,40677092,"NRV, Chippewa Valley Angel Investors Network",1,2,,Private,,,,,,
