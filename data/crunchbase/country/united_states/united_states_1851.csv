If eHarmony could tackle relationships (which are much more complicated) then surely it can be done for jobs too. CrestHire will function in the following way. A) There will be a marketplace that will allow agencies to post jobs. Applicants can apply for these jobs. Agencies can search for applicants and contact them immediately. B) Make the applicant fill an exhaustive questionnaire. The more complete the application is the better the prospects of landing a job. Revenue: It will be a subscription model.
