The Web is the most powerful tool for communication in the history of humanity, creating the potential for all people to participate in building a more peaceful and equitable world. However, only a small minority of people – mainly urban, male, and affluent – are part of the Web’s global conversation. Despite the recent surge in mobile internet access, nearly two-thirds of the world’s people (mostly in the developing world) are still not connected at all. And once connected, what people are able to do on and with the Web is increasingly threatened by government controls, as well as by certain commercial practices. We seek to establish the open Web as a global public good and a basic right, ensuring that everyone can access and use it freely. The foundation is unendowed and relies on charitable donations and partnerships to carry out its work.

In addition to the power line communications interferace to inverters, the GATEWAY also has a zWave (908 MHz) wireless interaface that enables power consumption monitoring via current clamps placed in any utility panel. When cloud communication is selected. it is performed through an Ethernet or integrated WiFi interface.  One GATEWAY can communicate with uo to 255 microinverters. For larger commercial installations, multiple GATEWAY devices are used in combination with Line Communications Filters (LCF) to separate networking domains across the site.
