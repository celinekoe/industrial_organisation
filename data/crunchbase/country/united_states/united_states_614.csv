He started his company, Freight Connection (and Freight Connection.com) in 1998.  Since then, he has booked more than 200,000 loads of freight and earned millions of dollars representing hundreds of industrial clients.    Their annual revenues have been consistently between $2M and $3M, and their profit margins are 17% - 20%.  They have been profitable in every year of their company's existence. About a year ago, he was hit by a """"triple-whammy:""""  a big client stuck him for $70,000 in unpaid invoices (lawsuit to recover is pending); the Feds raised my Motor Carrier Bond requirement from $10K to $75K and he had to write a check for the difference; and his biggest client went to a new logistics system, taking away nearly half his monthly business and cash flow.   These events caused his company's credit rating to plummet, causing further problems with factors who would not take his invoices based on their computerized review of their financial condition. Now, after a year of bootstrapping, they are ready to grow again: * Their new web site (FreightConnection.com) is in test mode and will roll out within 60 days. *They have replaced all of the business they lost, and are now in a position to grow 3X or more in the next year and as much as 10X within three years. *They require cash primarily to finance invoices, and for increased marketing: their truckers (for example) require payment upon delivery, while their shippers usually pay in 30-45 days.  The shortfall in cash flow is holding us back from growing to their full potential.  This isn't a startup, and it's not a """"sexy"""" business.  All they do is provide world-class,  full-service shipping and freight services to industrial clients, some of whom they have done business with for more than 15 years. Last year, when the DOT raised the bond for freight brokers, nearly 1/3 of the 16,000 estimated brokers nationwide went out of business.",Transportation,,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Since its inception, BlueRoads provided a closed-loop system with built-in methodology, which gives individual partner representatives the power to actively participate in the sales and marketing process. As a result, BLUEROADS has become the hub of collaboration between vendors and partners, achieving the mutually-beneficial goals of increasing opportunities, conversion rates, revenue and market share. Founding Philosophy BLUEROADS laid the foundation for successful channel management by pioneering the ""Active Participation Network"" model (APN). In managing multi-billion dollar channel operations for more than 20 years, BLUEROADS' founding team recognized that technology solutions which encouraged partners to participate within vendor processes were non-existent. The company quickly established itself as a solution designed to benefit both groups equally. Today, BLUEROADS is setting the standard in channel management with its Active Participation Network model, networking not just with the partner organizations, but all the way down to individual partner sales reps. Traditional Partner Relationship Management (PRM) systems are designed to simply capture data with the end goal of organizing and managing partners, and to automate partner management tasks. In some cases there were more lofty goals, but ultimately the benefit was one sided to the vendor and partner adoption was extremely low. BLUEROADS 6 is designed with unique partner and opportunity-focused methodologies. The processes are streamlined between vendor and partner, allowing both parties to collaborate while maintaining respective access and privacy. Data is captured automatically as partner sales reps work on opportunities, and that information is consolidated into real-time reports. This partner-centric design reduces the time and effort required for partners to actively participate, and increases adoption of vendor programs and processes.","Sales and Marketing, Software",2,"Axel Schultze, Marita Roebkes",51-100,4,M&A,21300000,USD,21300000,21300000,USD,21300000,"El Dorado Ventures, Cardinal Venture Capital, The Halo Fund, ZenShin Capital, ArrowPath Venture Partners",2,5,,Private,,,,,,
