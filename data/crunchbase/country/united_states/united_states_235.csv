With over 200 years of combined experience among its leaders, Lincoln Strategy Group is more than equipped to accommodate a variety of client needs and is always prepared to provide clients the skills necessary to accomplish their goals, no matter how big or small. Past projects undertaken by the team members of Lincoln Strategy Group include work with the Republican National Committee, campaigns in presidential, state, congressional, and local races, get-out-the-vote efforts, and successful government advocacy at all levels. Perhaps most impressive is the diverse and well-traveled team prepared to take on your campaign at Lincoln Strategy Group. In addition to cofounders Nathan Sproul and Meghan Cox, the team includes a former Congressional Chief of Staff, several legislative aids, and a number of seasoned campaign, public affairs, and public relations experts with both national and international experience. Lincoln Strategy Group has helped over 1000 clients develop their message, identify their audience, craft a strategy, and execute the tactics that help accomplish their goals in all 50 states. Recently, Lincoln Strategy Group has expanded internationally, opening an office in Barcelona, Spain. Lincoln has long worked with clients overseas, but the European expansion via the creation of Lincoln Global Public Affairs—headed by Executive Vice President Dan Centinello—seeks to put more feet to the ground, immersing employees in the culture and atmosphere of those whom they seek to help. Recogition for the hard work put into the campaigns has become second nature for Lincoln Strategy Group; some awards they’ve received in just the past few years include Stevie Awards, Pollie Awards, Reed Awards, MarCom Awards, Digital PR Newswire Awards, AVA Digital Awards, HSMAI Awards, Hermes Creative Awards, US EPA Awards, American Gaming Association Awards, and a Gaming Voice Award.","Government and Military, Other, Professional Services, Sales and Marketing, Social Impact",2,"Meghan Cox, Nathan Sproul",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
