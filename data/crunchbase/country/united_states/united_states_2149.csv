Their Founder, Scent Strategist and Perfume Mage, Christi Meshell, is “the Nose” behind some of the most compelling and award-winning fragrances now hitting the niche fragrance scene.  Her versatility as both Creative Director and Fragrance Composer allow her to single handedly develop a concept from initial inspiration, to rare ingredient gathering and onwards to final display. Meshell created House of Matriarch as a high perfumery rooted in the rich history of storytelling, magical and mystical ingredients and the transmutative character of alchemical principles — the rarest elements recombined to a new golden visage. Meshell herself speaks that language – a ancient tongue that is luxuriously mysterious, powerfully rendered and recalling the craft of the apothecary. While Meshell’s fragrance narrative tells stories of the misted past, her principles of action carry their community into the future, to the pinnacle of the highest art of perfume making and layered scent storytelling.  Hearkening back to the mysteries of thousands of years of discovery and experiment, craft and artful application, Christi has gathered that heritage to a renewed modernist appraisal of the futurist art of high perfumery.

Fluidinfo provides a no-questions-asked writable social object to represent each and every thing. Using a flexible underlying representation of information and a new model of control, it allows users and applications to work with information without constraint. That includes dynamically organizing, sharing, combining and augmenting information, and searching in ways that have previously not been possible. It also allows users to choose exactly which information to share with whom, with separate controls for reading and writing.  Fluidinfo makes it possible for data to be social. It allows almost unlimited information personalization by individual users and applications, and also between them. This makes it simple to build a wide variety of applications that benefit from cooperation, and which are open to unanticipated future enhancements. Even more importantly, Fluidinfo facilitates and encourages the growth of applications that leave users in control of their own data.","Apps, Commerce and Shopping, Information Technology, Internet Services, Mobile, Software",1,Terry Jones,11-50,3,,1668735,USD,1668735,1668735,USD,1668735,"Betaworks, Founder Collective, Lerer Hippeau, RRE Ventures, IA Ventures",1,13,,Private,,,,,,
