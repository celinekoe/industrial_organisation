Just as each individual molecule of a material affects how waves interact with it, it is possible to engineer small discrete shapes called unit cells into the material that have the effect of tailoring its properties to suit specific needs. So long as these unit cells are sufficiently small compared to the wavelength of the signal, they appear to the signal as a continuous surface. Before the advent of metamaterials, wave propagation through a medium was thought of as a static property of that substance, similar to hardness or color. The importance of metamaterials is that they allow engineers to manipulate wave propagation by arranging the unit cells in different ways, and by either mechanically or electrically tuning each unit cell on command. By changing the electrical or mechanical characteristics of each individual element, the properties of the material as a whole can be effectively controlled to a high degree of precision. To give an example, although gold is a good conductor and reflects yellow light, one could design a metamaterial out of gold that was an insulator and appears red in color.","Hardware, Information Technology, Other",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

It is very easy to use. You just need a twitter account. Why is twwit based on twitter? The answer is easy: 170,000,000 users.  Yes but... twitter has 3 weaknesses: - you can discuss in private with only one person at a time, - this person must follow you otherwise you can't send a private message (DM), - the tweets can't have more than 140 characters. If we want to exchange ideas with friends or family, to brainstorm with collegues or customers, we must use other tools. Frankly, they all have disadvantages.  The alternative, simple & easy: twwit.com That was our main point: twwit is easy to use. 1 click to create a discussion then, just enter the twitter usernames of the participants and that's it! Could it be more simple? Discussions are privates, i.e. you must be invited and identified with your twitter account.  To inform participants, you have 2 choices: 1) check the box ""Send a tweet to invite"", 2) or send by e-mail the short URL of the discussion It is the same for the updates.  Many people think 140 characters are not enough, we authorize more than 1,000 characters + asynchronous video chats. Maximum Security We use OAuth protocol to pair your twitter account with your twwit account, with no need to communicate your password. You can revoke the access anytime. Every page is encrypted with 128-bits SSL certificate + your conversations are encrypted before being saved in our database. Even our developers can't read your twwits.  Mobility | Multi platform We thought it was a good idea to developp twwit for web and for mobiles, using the brand new jQuery Mobile. So you can use twwit.com from your iPhone, Android phone, Blackberry, Windows Phone, etc.","Apps, Information Technology, Internet Services, Messaging and Telecommunications, Privacy and Security, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
