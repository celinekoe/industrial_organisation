So in short order a consumer driven, grassroots organization emerged, which over the last two decades has undertaken a number of projects designed to focus on unmet needs in their community. The staff at CAI is committed to the idea of systems change. Instead of the traditional fee-for-service model, they operate primarily from state and federal grant funding. This methodology has enabled us to design more cost-effective, person-friendly, programming strategies. Whether assisting a returning veteran with traumatic brain injury or post-traumatic stress disorder, training a special education teacher to become a vendor with the West Virginia Division of Rehabilitation Services and work with their own students as adults, or finding less costly and better community options to a nursing home placement, their programs are designed to look at alternatives to the bureaucratic ""business as usual"" model.w","Community and Lifestyle, Other, Professional Services, Social Impact",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
