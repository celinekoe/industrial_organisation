Using proprietary algorithms, sap flow and weather data are analyzed and processed to compute three parameters: reference evapotranspiration, plant transpiration, and vine stress. Users can connect, integrate, and overlay vineyard information using the web-based application. Sap Flow Sensors are installed in the vineyard to identify how the vineyard is transpiring and responding to the weather; a wireless network is added to sensors to allow automatic data retrieval, which is done every 15 minutes and transmitted in real time; and the weather and sap flow data are routed to a central server where the data is stored. The company’s process includes initial consultation: visits vineyards, gathers some history, and determines the best locations for the sensors; installation: installs, de-installs, and calibrates sensors according to plant architecture; analysis: analyzes the irrigation effect on vine via transpiration monitoring; and training: offers technical training sessions on how to install sensors and interpret vine transpiration profiles.

We do this through our unique patented approach called: On-Board Real-Time Multi-Sensor Diagnostics. This approach provides a connected, holistic first-person diagnostic view of the conveyor and its payload. Our systems provide a first-hand multi-sensor experience of the conveyor system route by either attaching to the tote/package or attaching to the moving parts of the conveyor itself, and use a unique set of cameras, sensors, thermography, and location synchronization to build a layered-holistic view of the health of the system.  Some of the largest companies in the world use our “Mobile” Multi-Sensor conveyor diagnostic systems – 100’s of distribution centers in 8 countries. These devices are used to identify and alert via threshold events, impending or existing failure states for conveyance. Our customers typically make it mandatory for reliability engineers at their distribution facilities to use these systems to validate the commissioning phase for conveyors at new centers, as well as for routine maintenance at new and legacy centers.  For the last 10 years, TinMan Systems has also been providing software and professional services for the development and deployment of real-time autonomous systems.
