The Tax Foundation's agenda has had a large impact on state and federal tax debates. At the federal level, they have built the tools and intellectual arguments for initiating a multi-year debate over fundamental tax reform and restoring America’s global tax competitiveness. At the state level, they advise policymakers how to make their tax systems more pro-growth and use their various state rankings to foster tax competition between the states. At the heart of the great depression, federal spending had climbed 170 percent; over the previous five years internal revenue collections had risen 198 percent. So concerned about the effect such expansion might have on private sector growth, a small group of business executives gathered in New York City to discuss how they could monitor fiscal activities at all levels of government and convey the information to the general public. They decided to launch an organization which, through research and analysis, could inform and educate Americans using objective, reliable data on government finance. In the subsequent seven decades, the Tax Foundation has been a leader in promoting a sense of tax consciousness in the public. Its distribution of information has helped provide policymakers and the public with the lay of the land in the ongoing debate over tax and budget policies and a greater understanding of the policies proposed. The Tax Foundation's agenda has had a large impact on state and federal tax debates.

At the state level, they advise policymakers how to make their tax systems more pro-growth and use their various state rankings to foster tax competition between the states. Tax Foundation research receives a record number of citations, ranging from newspaper and television journalists to governors and presidential candidates. In addition to traditional outreach and media cultivation, their videos have done much to advance public education on key tax issues, as has their blog and their social media presence on Facebook and Twitter.

By enabling Buyers (individual and small restaurant groups and other food service organizations, such as, hotels, schools, hospitals, country clubs, etc.) and Sellers (small and mid-sized distributors, specialty food manufacturers and local farms) to interact on an unprecedented scale and with exceptional ease and efficiency, Foodem.com provides previously unachievable benefits to both parties. For Buyers, Foodem greatly expands the number of distributors they can do business with. Membership is FREE and sign-up takes only about a minute. Using the Company’s proprietary search tools they can establish the price transparency they need to better manage and even reduce their food costs by comparative shopping simultaneously among multiple local suppliers; up to 50 different items into a single search. Available items from all Sellers serving the Buyer’s location are then reflected in the search results sorted according to the Buyer’s preference of price and distance from the Seller, and orders can be placed electronically with multiple Sellers in one transaction. Including specialty food manufacturers and local farms will enhance assortment and delivery options; automating order processing will reduce errors; real-time reporting will improve menu pricing decisions; and GIS web-based technology will allow them to know the origins of the products they buy. Sellers of ALL food categories from meats, seafood, produce, dry goods to paper and cleaning products - any and everything a wholesale establishment needs to run their business - are welcome. Sign-up is easy and it’s free. Because Sellers offerings will be captured in searches by all Buyers on the marketplace, Sellers now have the opportunity to sell to many more customers than they can reach with their limited direct sales force. And Foodem provides the tools, including real-time, customized product catalogs, a unique store-front (URL) that they can market to Buyers and targeted advertising and promotional opportunities, that will increase sales and return on their marketing investment. In addition, automated inventory and pricing updates and an interface with their ERP systems will lower processing costs and increase customer satisfaction; and an expedited payment option will accelerate cash flow and reduce risk of bad debt. Sellers pay Foodem a 2% commission on the orders they receive. As Groupon, Zynga, and Amazon have done, Foodem.com is building the best of breed product in its vertical market by using and enhancing proven open source technologies to offer an open, free trading platform. Several methodologies, algorithms, and unique applications of existing technology are the core of the Company’s intellectual property that will differentiate Foodem.com from competitors and make it difficult for others to duplicate. Search capability, user interface, and product catalog are key points of competition between online marketplaces. Foodem.com has decisive advantages in all three areas, and certain components of its proprietary technology are believed to be patentable, including a two-step process for Sellers to upload 40,000 inventory items in bulk in less than 15 minutes; a one-step process for Sellers to update pricing in bulk; a Localized Smart Decision Engine that enables Buyers to conduct simultaneous searches on up to 50 items among multiple Sellers and place multiple orders with multiple Sellers in a single transaction; and a Master Guide/Order List that shows details of all previously purchased items for quick re-ordering.  Foodem.com began closed Beta testing with select Buyers and Sellers in November 2010. Foodem 2.0 is scheduled to be operational in Q4 2012. All of the original participants have been active since the closed Beta began and, while the Company chose not to recruit other Buyers or Sellers during this time, 225 Buyers and 100 sellers from 32 states have signed-up on their own initiative. The Company’s website and blog receives about 2,000 unique hits/month, with the average visitor spending four minutes on the website, and a stream of offline inquiries has been received from parties searching for a better way of doing business. Simultaneously with the launch of Foodem 2.0 the Company plans to commence commercial operations in the D.C. Metro Area and subsequently expand into other major markets and eventually nationally. The Company will initially serve independent restaurants and small restaurant groups (about 760,000 nationally) on the Buyers’ side and 33,000 small and mid-sized distributors, 2,900 specialty food manufacturers and thousands of local farms. Later customized offerings will be developed for other Buyers, including hotels, country clubs, catering companies, day cares, schools, universities, and expansion into other metropolitan areas. In addition to commissions noted above, other revenues will be derived from developing personalized Seller web stores, advertising; and data analytics (BI) services.","Administrative Services, Commerce and Shopping, Food and Beverage, Travel and Tourism",1,Kash Rehman,1-10,3,Seed,800000,USD,800000,875000,USD,875000,"TEDCO, Dingman Center for Entrepreneurship, Kash Rehman",,3,,Private,,,,,,

Located in sunny Duarte, California, Value Windows and Doors spent years perfecting the design of its highly certified products. On the exterior, customers see a level of craftsmanship not often found in vinyl windows and doors. Unlike many companies, Value Windows and Doors custom manufactures [exterior doors and windows](http://valuewindowsdoors.com/index.php/product) instead of mass-producing them. Behind the products’ attractive exterior is what separates them from the pack: uncompromising energy efficient technology and construction that reduces sound and helps prevent break-ins. Installing exterior doors and windows is a serious investment, but consumers can feel confident knowing they are getting great looking products that improve the climate control and security of their home.  **Eco-Friendly Products** Behind the products’ stylish aesthetics is topnotch energy efficiency technology for exterior doors and windows, most notably: LoĒ³-366:registered: glass from Cardinal, which uses a triple silver layer to limit solar gain without decreasing clarity and duralite spacers to preserve insulating argon gas between layers of glass. DuraPane laminated glass is also available for sound reduction and security. According to a 2012 National Association of Homebuilders (NAHB) study, homebuyers are increasingly looking for energy efficient windows. Respondents identified Energy Star products, Low-E insulating glass, and triple pane insulating glass as the three top “essential/must have” types of vinyl windows. Value Windows and Doors’ windows have all three features. In uncertain economic times, homebuyers look for qualities in a home that signal low utility costs. If you are homeowner who is looking for an incentive to install energy saving windows besides the prospect of selling your home somewhere down the line, a federal tax credit act offers you savings when you install Energy Star certified windows any time through the end of 2013. **In-House Manufacturing** Vinyl windows and doors are a modern manufacturing marvel that can be produced in large numbers in a short period of time, but this isn’t how Value Windows and Doors operates. Instead of outsourcing manufacturing to a third party, the company runs its own factory, which helps control manufacturing costs and creates savings that are passed on to customers. When customers place an order, professional installers come to the residence to measure window and door spaces and examine the home’s climate control needs. After finalizing the order with the customer, the data is delivered to the factory, where custom products are manufactured. After passing a thorough inspection, the products are scheduled for delivery. With so few door and window companies offering products that have Value Windows and Doors’ combination of aesthetics, energy efficiency, and manufacturing quality, the company’s products are steadily increasing in popularity. Value Windows and Doors ships products to destinations throughout the U.S. [Visit the company’s website](http://valuewindowsdoors.com/index.php/) for more information.","Manufacturing, Real Estate",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Their interactive, real-time videoconferencing has effectively enabled healthcare professionals to deliver care to individuals when they need it, regardless of location. Additionally, CNOW's telehealth solutions help decrease the occurrence of common challenges such as lack of access, long wait times and gaps in extended care. Since 2002 they have been providing IT services to broad range of organizations -- clinics, hospitals, residential group homes, and many other small, medium and large service organizations; in addition to our interactive video products.  With the rapid digital transformation to cloud technologies, they recognize the power and opportunity this provides to organizations to simplify and secure their technology infrastructure.     CNOW has been a pioneer in developing and testing telehealth solutions. Their technology and delivery care models have been tested through State and Federal research awards. These studies have involved a multitude of health care professionals: primary care physicians, psychiatrists, nurses, speech therapists, behavior analysts, social workers and educational administrators. CNOW has spoken twice at U.S. Senate Hearings on Combating Autism. Over 8,000 telehealth sessions were completed in these research studies, with a success rate of over 90%. Click on the following links to learn more about the various clinical studies: Telehealth and Developmental Disabilities, Telehealth and Therapeutic Foster Care Services, Project 12 Ways, and Telehealth and Early Intervention for Autism.
