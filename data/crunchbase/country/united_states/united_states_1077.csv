We are honored to collaborate with some of the biggest innovators in the healthcare industry. What We Do: Four in ten adults in the U.S. have reported symptoms of anxiety or depressive disorder during the COVID pandemic. This is just one of many alarming statistics as we face a global and unavoidable mental health crisis. FireflyVR is determined to build new and novel ways to blend technology and therapies to ease this trend. Product: The Sanctuary is a Virtual Reality experience built to prepare a patient for a transformational ketamine treatment. It incorporates established techniques used by leading experts to provide a safe, engaging, and comfortable experience to prepare for meaningful therapy. The Sanctuary is a clinically designed solution that combines cognitive behavioral therapy to help reduce pre-procedure anxiety and develop positive intentions when the medicine is administered, ultimately improving outcomes. The Sanctuary is built with modularity in mind as other dissociative medicines become approved and understood beyond ketamine.  We’re working hard with our team of experts to build and scientifically validate The Sanctuary as ketamine treatment becomes readily available. The modular foundation of The Sanctuary allows us to quickly and effectively adapt the experience to target a vast range of indications and therapies. Our initial target to treat treatment resistant depression is only the beginning of a wide-ranging and impactful journey.","Hardware, Health Care, Software",,,11-50,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,Mystic Ventures,,1,,Private,,,,,,

All end-point communication is generally bi-directional, but also supports operation such as multicast enabling software upgrade over the air or other mass distribution messages to reduce the on air communication time. Communication between end-devices and gateways is spread out on different frequency channels and data rates. The selection of the data rate is a trade-off between communication range and message duration. Due to the spread spectrum technology, communications with different data rates do not interfere with each other and create a set of ""virtual"" channels increasing the capacity of the gateway. LoRaWAN data rates range from 0.3 kbps to 50 kbps. To maximize both battery life of the end-devices and overall network capacity, the LoRaWAN network server is managing the data rate and RF output for each end-device individually by means of an adaptive data rate (ADR) scheme. National wide networks targeting internet of things such as critical infrastructure, confidential personal data or critical functions for the society has a special need for secure communication.","Hardware, Internet Services, Other, Social Impact, Software",2,"Geoff Mulligan, Hardy Schmidbauer",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Temperatures below the surface can reach 4,200Â° C, decreasing to 650 - 1200Â° at depths of 80km-100km. Through the deep circulation of groundwater and the intrusion of molten magma into the earth's crust at depths of only 1km-5km, the heat is brought closer to the earth's surface. The molten rock then heats the surrounding groundwater, which is forced to the surface in certain areas in the form of steam or hot water (i.e. hot springs, geysers).
