(AFO). AFO is a privately-held company based in North Salt Lake, Utah under the shadows of the majestic Wasatch mountains. AFO was founded in 1993 with the intent of introducing high standards of aerospace fiber optic engineering practices to the US telecommunications industry. By 1995, AFO founders had successfully achieved their goal and were supporting fiber optic splicing and testing operations throughout the western United States. Those field service offerings continue today, and have expanded to include fiber characterization testing throughout the United States. As AFO began its field service operations, it became obvious to the founders that there had to be a better way to document fiber optic networks. At the conclusion of nearly every fiber optic project AFO would be asked to prepare binders full of paper records that would summarize the work that had been done so that it could be combined with other binders of records to serve as documentation for the project. The problem was, the outside plant data within those binders was not easy to get to, let alone analyze to help make insightful decisions. Thus, the birth of the idea of OSPINSIGHT. By 1996 OSPINSIGHT software products were being distributed to AFO customers to help them better understand and interact with their network documentation. The move towards paperless documentation was underway. Since that time, millions of strands of fibers have been documented in OSPINSIGHT products throughout the world. And, the passion to develop, distribute , and support software applications to more efficiently and effectively document fiber optic networks moves forward today.","Hardware, Information Technology, Science and Engineering, Software",,,11-50,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
