Families connect via a mobile app to search, discover, and create local experiences to share with their young children. The Adventure Clubs free mobile app offers an opportunity for families with young children to easily create beautiful childhood memories. Forget about those cumbersome lists of what to do with kids in a particular city. Just because something exists doesn’t mean there will be any other families there when you go. And we all know, everything is more fun in a group.  Our kids need education, socialization and stimulation, and so do we. That’s why Adventure Clubs exists. This is your opportunity to handcraft the life that your child dreams of… One that’s full of adventure, experienced with the person they love most–you! Adventures are exciting planned experiences, created by other parents just like you, and brought to you via the Adventure Clubs mobile app. Adventures are created and led by Adventure Leaders and may happen any day of the week. On any given adventure, there are usually 3 - 12 families including moms or dads, and their children (ages 6 months - 10 years). Imagine, every day opening up your Adventure Clubs app and being able to easily find what’s happening near you and then going on adventures alongside other families with kids!  It’s flexible too. You just adventure whenever it works for you–with no minimum, no maximum, no commitment at all. It’s easy and fun for parents, and incredible for kids!  With the Adventure Clubs app, you can: • Browse local adventures your family will enjoy • Choose and RSVP to adventures you like • Create your own adventures to experience with others • Invite your family and friends to adventure with you • Message co-adventurers before and after your adventure You can create or explore exciting local adventures in these twelve categories:  • Animals • Creative • Education • Environment • Food • Museums & Culture • Music & Dance • Parks & Playgrounds • Sports & Fitness • Transportation • Water Play • Other Through this app, we have loads of incredible, kid-friendly, local, family-oriented adventure options offered to us at our finger tips. Adventuring is experiential learning at it’s finest, and learning through experience is how kids learn best.  If you’d like to be an Adventure Leader, all you need is a great idea and you can create one on your Adventure Clubs app. You can set the adventure to “public” if you want to open it up to meet new friends or set it to “private” and invite only your current friends to join your adventure. There are two different kinds of adventures with Adventure Clubs:  • Everyday Adventures  • Premium Adventures An Everyday Adventure is something simple and easy to plan such as bike riding at a local park, hiking through the forest, getting hot chocolates and playing puzzles at a coffee shop, or making sandcastles on the beach. Forget about “play dates”-adventuring is way more fun!  A Premium Adventure is an extra special adventure that is set up by the Adventure Clubs team with a local Adventure Host, (a local business or non-profit organization). A Premium Adventure might be a special behind-the-scenes tour of a famous theater, or a baking class with a pastry chef, or a meet-n-greet with professional performers or athletes, a tour of a private jet. Adventure Clubs is always coming up with incredible ideas for Premium Adventures.  The price for each Premium Adventure is different and all of the information will be in the adventure description in the app and the amount for the Premium Adventure is to be paid directly to the Adventure Host (place of business or non-profit organization). Premium Adventures are led by our top leaders, who are hand-picked and trained by Adventure Clubs.  So what are you waiting for? Let’s go on an adventure!","Apps, Community and Lifestyle, Consumer Electronics, Education, Events, Hardware, Media and Entertainment, Mobile, Science and Engineering, Software",1,Janelle Schroy,11-50,2,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,Praxis,,1,,Private,,,,,,
