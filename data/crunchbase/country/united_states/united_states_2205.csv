The team thus works with its clients to find the right home at the right price for them, which include all the neighborhood amenities that matter.

WeSellLouisville.com takes care from everything that clients need from start to close.  Understanding that buyers often do not visualize living in a home the way that clients have been staying, the team can make homes attractive to an ideal audience, which is to help clients get top dollar. www.WeSellLouisville.com manages things such as staging the home, making repairs or minor improvements, or even simply painting the walls that can make the difference between a home that is resting on the market and the one that is sold fast. The Medley Sokoler team comprises of Bob and Norine Sokoler, Dedre Morse, Debbie Rood, Cathy Francow, Ellanie Onstott, and Stephanie Mason, who come from diverse backgrounds, yet share a common passion about real estate.

The Rand Group team has served clients throughout California and beyond for nearly 15 years. Rand herself is licensed to do business in California, Nevada, Colorado, Alabama, Idaho, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey, and Oklahoma; other Rand Group team members are licensed to do business in Florida and Pennsylvania.  In partnership with Merrill Lynch, The Rand Group delivers high-touch wealth management services for high net worth individuals and families at every stage of life. Rand and her team ensure that every client relationship is grounded in the belief that wealth is a means to an end — specifically, a means to turn clients’ long-term goals into reality. The Rand Group’s financial advisors and wealth management specialists design custom wealth management strategies from start to finish. Each relationship begins with a frank, thorough discussion of the client’s needs and objectives, with special attention paid to seven key priorities: Healthcare. The Rand Group empowers clients to plan for direct healthcare expenses, ongoing health and disability insurance needs, and long-term issues like long-term care insurance. Home. The Rand Group helps clients plan for inevitable changes on the home front: upsizing, downsizing, renovating, and purchasing vacation homes.   Family. The Rand Group provides clients with the tools they need to provide for those they love, including minor children and aging parents. Leisure. Daniella Rand and her team empower clients to get the most out of their hard-won leisure time. That means providing the tools, vision, and capacity they need to plan and save for international travel, take an existing hobby to the next level, or make a signature leisure purchase.  Philanthropy. The Rand Group is committed to doing right by the less fortunate. Rand and her team helps clients who choose to give back find ways to maximize their time, talents, and resources — whether that means mentoring young people, volunteering for local nonprofit organizations, or giving to charity. Work and Retirement. The Rand Group supports clients at all stages of their careers — and through retirement. Rand and her team assist with closely held business successions and sales, the pursuit of second and third careers, and managing cash flow in retirement.   Financial Planning. The Rand Group has the experience and expertise to help clients organize and systematize their present and future financial goals. With these priorities as its lodestar, The Rand Group team designs, implements, and monitors bespoke wealth management plans that leverage a range of wealth management products and services supported by the investment and banking resources of Merrill Lynch and Bank of America. These include general financial planning services, custom retirement planning services, 401(k) rollovers for new and existing clients, trusteed IRAs for new and existing clients, and loan services.  The Rand Group stands apart from independent wealth managers thanks to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch’s Relationship Pricing program. Relationship Pricing rewards loyal clients who entrust substantial assets to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, with benefits increasing at each successive account benchmark.","Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Professional Services",1,Daniella Rand,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
