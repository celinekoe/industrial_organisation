Pliant EFDs are ideal for a range of data I/O (input/output) intensive enterprise applications, such as trading floors, financial transactions, VOD, airline reservation systems, e-commerce, and Web 2.0 applications.   Pliantâ€™s EFD is a disruptive solution that offers breakthrough performance and reliability improvements over todayâ€™s highest performing hard drive and consumer solid state storage devices (SSD).  EFDs enable enterprise data centers to do â€œmuch more for lessâ€ â€“ achieve more performance and reliability with less cost, energy and space.  One EFD can replace many (100+) enterprise HDDs (10K/15K RPM) for performance, and by combining EFDs with high capacity HDDs, todayâ€™s storage racks can be reduced to storage shelves saving power (up to 80%), space and money.  Based on an advanced software architecture and proprietary ASIC design, Pliantâ€™s EFD changes the storage system paradigm while meeting growing â€œGreen ITâ€ energy efficiency.
