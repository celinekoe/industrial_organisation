The paper, originally known as Normal Outlook and then Cub Californian, has mostly published each school day of the year since the mid-1920s. The Bruin is now the only five-day paper serving a University of California campus. Countless alumni from The Bruin have gone on to work for top daily newspapers and news organizations around the world. Bruin alumni have gone on to receive three Pulitzer Prizes and a Nobel Peace Prize. In Kerckhoff 118, the Daily Bruinâs central-campus office, about 250 students work in 14 editorial sections to produce the paper each day. Students serve as the paperâs editors, reporters, photographers, videojournalists, designers and programmers. An editorial board composed of UCLA students serves as the newspaperâs official voice on matters concerning students. The Bruin also regularly performs strongly in college media competitions. In 2014, the paper received the ACP Pacemaker award, widely recognized as the most prestigious honor in college journalism, for the nationâs best daily college newspaper. In 2015, the paper received 30 California College Media Association awards, including the award for Best Daily Newspaper in the state for the second year in a row. Students on the paper have a unique opportunity to report abroad for free each year. The Bridget OâBrien Foundation, an organization dedicated to a former Bruin staffer, awards a scholarship to a team of Bruin reporters each summer, which allows the students to travel for free anywhere in the world and report on issues relevant to UCLA. The Bruin is one of the most applied-to organizations on campus, with about 560 students submitting applications each year. About 9,000 copies of the paper are distributed each day at dozens of locations across UCLA. The paper is also read each day by thousands of students using phones, laptops and tablets to browse the Daily Bruinâs online content. Because UCLA does not have a journalism major or school, the Daily Bruin serves as the universityâs primary training ground for young journalists. Daily Bruin alumni have worked at many top news organizations, including National Public Radio, BBC, the New York Times and the Washington Post. The Daily Bruin is a resource to the students, faculty, staff and community members of UCLA and Westwood. The paper offers local insight and coverage of events, trends and important topics on campus every day it prints.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment, Other",,,501-1000,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
