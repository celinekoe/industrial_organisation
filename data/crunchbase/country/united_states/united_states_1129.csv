We promote and develop projects that foster the growth of unique communities with great tourist potential, and we carry out experiences so that tourists can connect with the impact that these projects generate in tourist destinations. We were born in 2011 as an initiative of the Esteban Torbar Foundation (FET) to create a microfinance platform for tourism entrepreneurs at the base of the pyramid in potentially tourist communities. We submitted our project to the ""Geotourism Challenge: Destinations on the Edge"" contest, sponsored by National Geographic, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and Ashoka Changemakers and was one of the 7 winners and the only one from Venezuela. Although due to external factors we could not obtain the prize funds, we decided to develop the model on a smaller scale in 5 communities in Venezuela (Kamarata, Birongo, Pueblos del Sur, Mango de Ocoyta and Puerto Sur). Under this scheme we were able to finance and execute more than 40 projects in the aforementioned communities, through an online crowdfunding platform, developed and programmed in-house.   This model mutated as Venezuela changed, until in 2014 we decided to include experiential trips to connect tourists with the communities and instead of supporting entrepreneurial projects, we began to finance more ambitious community projects with a greater impact on the communities. After several years of learning and fine-tuning our project design and selection policy, in 2019 we finally managed to integrate experiential travel into our project execution strategy, which is now described as EXPERIENTIAL PROJECTS that transform lives through sustainable tourism. Our current projects are especially focused on the development of education in unique, remote communities with great tourism potential, and fall into the following categories: culture, sports, technology and environment.",,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Studies show that 4 out of 5 college students consume beer on a regular basis with the average student drinking 48.3 gallons annually. With over 21 million students currently enrolled in US colleges there is a huge opportunity to introduce homebrewing into an untapped college market.  In 2012, homebrewing generated over $1 billion in annual economic activity, growing at over 20 percent a year. Most of this new growth comes from young adults who are introduced to the DIY brewing craze, yet no one is targeting the enormous beer brazen college market. The perception is that homebrewing is a complicated and expensive hobby. Without any clear direction many would-be brewers are intimidated and give up before they even start. Many that do try homebrewing end up wasting hundreds of dollars on unnecessary equipment, ending up with bad beer. That's a problem…and an opportunity.   That's where College Brewer comes in.  We've simplified homebrewing. Everything has been broken down into the basics so that brewing your own beer is an easy-to-learn and fulfilling hobby. Between our online support, easy to follow instructions, and video database you'll never be stranded without an answer. And not only that, we've made everything affordable. College students are on a budget. Understandable considering they’re entering what is possibly the most debt ridden portion of their life. We’ve developed Brew Kits that allow brewers to make their own beer at college without breaking the bank.  To reach this goal College Brewer is seeking $50,000 in equity investment to fund the business start-up.","Commerce and Shopping, Food and Beverage",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Using the paper as a bully pulpit, Bradford was credited with getting the state to build a new bridge linking York and Lancaster counties on Doby’s Bridge Road. He crusaded against a poultry processing plant that was unpopular with residents. The plant closed and left town. In 1965, Bradford sold the paper to Tri­County Publishing of Lancaster, a subsidiary of Leroy Springs & Co., the textile firm that was the center of town for more than a century. Bradford remained editor under new publishers Julian Starr Jr. and Paul League.

Despite an ongoing information revolution, litigation has steadily increased.  Even sophisticated parties and experienced council have very limited access to hard data depicting decision risks and pendency costs. With JudicialStats, the hard data is finally here.
