Now Nanoramic is commercializing this technology to revolutionize growing industries like electric vehicle batteries and consumer and industrial electronics. Nanoramic’s predecessor, FastCAP Systems (now FastCap Ultracapacitors), was founded in 2009 by two PhDs from MIT.  The company received sizable government grants leading to the development of the only ultracapacitors capable of operating in temperatures up to 150°C and under conditions of high shock and vibration.  The FastCap Ultracapacitors family of products has since expanded to include wide temperature range lithium-ion capacitors, structural ultracapacitors, and the only reflowable, low ESR, slim profile ultracapacitor on the market. The hard work required to develop energy st orage for such extreme environments drove our engineers to develop Neocarbonix, an electrode platform for rechargeable Li-ion batteries, Li-ion capacitors, and supercapacitors that would outperform all competitors. In addition to Neocarbonix and FastCap Ultracapacitors, the Nanoramic product family includes Thermexit. Thermexit is a line of high-end thermal interface gap filler pads.

Real-time MRI-imaging clearly defines the targeted tumor from the surrounding soft tissue and other critical organs during radiation treatment allowing the system to deliver radiation to the tumor accurately while delivering less radiation to healthy tissue. MRIdian’s increased target accuracy combined with improved tumor visibility and accurate dose recording means clinicians can treat patients who would not previously have been considered radiation therapy candidates.

Our mission is to decentralize social media the same way Bitcoin and Ethereum are decentralizing the financial system. As a layer-1 blockchain, DeSo can be compared to other blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, etc... However, DeSo has several major advantages over these platforms, the largest being that it is designed to power storage-heavy applications (like social applications and marketplaces). To put it in perspective, storing just a 200-character ""Tweet"" on Ethereum costs ~$80, and costs ~$0.25-$1.00+ on Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, and virtually all other smart contract chains. In contrast, it costs 1/1,000th of a penny on DeSo, which is why breakthrough apps like Diamond, DAODAO, Pearl, OpenProsper, NFTz, and Entre, now possible exclusively on DeSo. Today, social media is even more centralized than the financial industry was prior to the creation of Bitcoin. A handful of private entities effectively control public discourse, and earn monopoly profits off of content that they don't even create.

We believe the same type of technology will cause this conclusion to ultimately play out in social. DeSo’s advantages make it capable of breaking this status quo for the first time, and bringing competition and innovation back to social in much the same way Bitcoin and Ethereum have done for our financial system.
