Sanitis is committed to educating the customer about their choices so a decision can be made with knowledge, not perception. they will only offer quality tested products. Their products don't rely on harsh chemicals to do their job. Instead they harness cutting edge technology to kill germs and odors and protect against re-contamination, safely and effectively. With new strains of bacteria and viruses appearing all the time, and with many of them becoming resistant to the chemicals they hope will kill them, new and better ways of protecting against them are needed.

Sanitis cares about your health, and they've made it their business to protect you against germs wherever you may be. Any environment in which people live, work, and play together can be a source of pathogens including cold and flu viruses, staph and strep infections, MRSA, Hepatitis, E.

It can be extremely difficult to keep these germs at bay with typical disinfectant products and procedures when surfaces are continuously being contaminated in homes, schools, offices, gyms, doctor's offices, restaurants, police and medical vehicles, dorms, and detention centers. Even a common handshake can lead to illness. Food borne, surface, and airborne pathogens cost the U.S. billions of dollars and many thousands of lives every year. Adults miss work, children miss school, and patients contract life-threatening illnesses in medical facilities while they are being treated for other conditions. They're out to change things with their unique line up of eco-friendly; non-toxic products and services that outperform the ones you're used to but worry about.
