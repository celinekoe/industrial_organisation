Manifest gives deskless workers instant virtual access to, and step-by-step guidance from, your most experienced technicians and trainers anywhere, anytime. Easily harness the knowledge of your experts. No development or special skills required. Manifest’s patented user-based authoring decreases the time to create content from weeks to hours.  Manifest was designed to work in the most secure, austere, and remote locations. The flexibility of the platform makes it easy to distribute the knowledge to empower your workforce wherever they may be. Manifest can be hosted in any cloud and can also be deployed on-premise on air-gapped servers without any connectivity. It’s device agnostic and will run on heads up displays, mobile phones, and tablets and can be used completely disconnected. Experts quickly document and record their specialized knowledge while operators and teams follow work instructions and complete complex and unfamiliar tasks efficiently. Technicians can work independently or collaborate and share procedures with teammates. Integrated communications capabilities allow workers to reach out to experts whenever they run into unforeseen problems. Audio, video, and text chats as well as video sharing allows experts to remotely obtain context and offer guidance. With the Manifest Open API, IIoT and SCADA data can be integrated to provide realtime sensor data, and warnings within the operators’ field of view so faster and better decisions can be made while performing procedures.  Management can track progress, training, business efficiencies, review evidence of completed tasks and evaluate performance, ultimately applying institutional expertise to help your workforce move faster, reduce human error, and increase quality while driving consistency across your organization.  Customers from a diverse set of industries are improving their operations and productivity with the Manifest platform. At PBC Linear, a US manufacturer of linear motion systems, Manifest speeds up technician training. They have decreased the time to get workers up to speed on complex procedures from three weeks to three days. The US Air Force was able to decrease error rates of first year propulsion mechanics from 92% to 0% when performing C-5 engine maintenance procedures. And technicians at PGT Industries, a window manufacturer, completed 2-hour machine maintenance procedures in 40 minutes using step-by-step, guided instructions created by their experts in Manifest.  The U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, Novartis, Jabil, Vodafone, SpaceX, Berkeley Labs and many other Manifest customers are also increasing efficiencies, safety, and quality while decreasing waste and scrap, time to resolution, time to value and generating workforce multiplication. Use cases are varied. Performing operational and maintenance procedures more accurately and faster with Manifest is common. Others use Manifest to improve their inspection, compliance, and audit procedures. Manifest’s fault reporting and resolution management, job history, and its ability to integrate into business systems provide tremendous value for these use cases. Manifest’s remote expert access and collaboration capabilities have driven many customers to adopt the platform and manufacturers of complex equipment and systems are planning to use this capability as a core component of their product support strategies.  And training continues to be an attractive use case to many Manifest Customers. On-the-job training, upskilling, learning new and complex procedures is just easier with Manifest.

The proliferation of connected devices promises to revolutionize consumer, commercial and industrial applications with greater convenience, lower operational costs and data-driven performance improvements. Already consumers have fallen in love with smart home conveniences, while many businesses have begun to reap the benefits of connected device driven efficiency gains such as electronic shelf labels and occupancy sensors. Giga scale applications for these technologies are around the corner: the potential exists for billions of wireless sensors to be installed during the coming decade, with nearly half located inside buildings. However, the challenge of reliably and affordably powering these devices has continued to limit IoT viability at scale. Connected electronics require continuous power, which until now has meant batteries that must be periodically replaced or recharged. Legacy photovoltaic technologies like amorphous silicon cells long used on solar calculators and childrens toys don’t yield sufficient power in the real-world, low light operational conditions for most IoT sensors. At the same time, the exorbitant price tag for high performance, low-light PV technologies like gallium arsenide cells has made them suitable only for space satellite and research applications, not mass-market electronics. Ambient has solved both the low power density and high cost problems of legacy low light PV technologies and created the world’s most powerful low light energy harvesting photovoltaic cells - making endless power for IoT electronics a reality for the first time.","Consumer Electronics, Energy, Hardware, Internet Services, Sustainability",2,"Bates Marshall, Kethinni Chittibabu",11-50,3,Early Stage Venture,61000000,USD,61000000,78500000,USD,78500000,"Trinity Capital, Silicon Valley Bank, I Squared Capital, Regeneration.VC, Climate Pledge Fund",3,11,,Private,,,,,,

One of our co-founders, Andrew Garcia, had a DJ business in college, and found that renting out equipment could be difficult and tedious. With his many years of experience as a Full Stack Developer, he knew he could change that. He partnered with Erik Dreyer, our other co-founder and UX extraordinaire, to build technology that made rentals easy. Their first rental marketplace was targeted at peer-to-peer rentals, but after receiving so much demand for event rentals, they transitioned to gear their rental solutions to the industry from which Andrew originally came: events. After interviewing a diverse array of event professionals, the pair realized they first must build a comprehensive software system in order to maximize the rental experience for both the vendors and the renters. They wanted to design a software program that not only did what event professionals needed it to do, but made it easy, fast and delightful along the way. With renewed focus, the duo hit the ground running. They hired our Executive Vice President, Karen Gordon, who had years of experience growing companies in both the events and technology sectors. The trio launched their SaaS platform, Goodshuffle Pro, in 2017 as a beta program and officially premiered the software at a trade show in January 2018. By 2019 the software was in 45 US states, Canada and Mexico. The company was crowned “Best Tech Startup in DC” and one of the “Coolest Places to Work” in 2020.

These compounds can be engineered and linked together to bind with many molecular targets that today’s drugs can’t bind with, Cohen said. The key insight, he said, is that the scientific founders have discovered a way to bind with select disease-causing proteins, and flag them as cellular trash, so that the ordinary proteasome garbage disposal system can get rid of them. Selecting the precise disease-related proteins to send to the trash is obviously critical, because any drug like this could cause serious side effects if it sent healthy proteins involved in normal cell processes to the trash. C4 Therapeutics is developing a new class of targeted protein degradation (TPD) therapeutics for the treatment of a broad range of diseases. Our Degronimid™ platform incorporates highly selective small molecule binders to target disease-causing proteins and facilitate their rapid destruction and clearance from the cell through the natural ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS). Because of this distinctive mechanism, Degronimids are capable of hitting many more targets, including those previously thought to be undruggable, while reducing the potential for drug resistance. The broad applicability of Degronimids, and our chemical biology platform designed for accelerated validation, have the potential to make an unprecedented impact across many diseases through multiple industry collaborations as well as proprietary programs.
