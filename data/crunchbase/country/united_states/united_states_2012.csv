Business owners still depend on others to get the latest reports and know about their finances. It is nearly impossible for them to work on their mobile and get real-time data. All of this leads to delayed decisions, loss of revenue, competitive edge, and lack of control of their own business. Keeping in mind these challenges, they built inCloudERP, an on-line, cloud-based App for business owners to use on their mobile, tablet, and PC.
