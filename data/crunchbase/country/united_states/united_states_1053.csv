Seizing the opportunity, he decided to create a premium candy line specifically for Florida tourists that focused on better tasting candy, higher quality ingredients, and more appealing packaging.   From his kitchen, he cooked up the first batch of Fudge-A-Gators™. Less than a year later, he perfected one of Florida’s staple candies and added the now-famous creamy Coconut Patties to his growing line of products. The confections were first sold through his tourist shop, but it wasn’t long before many other local shops and citrus stores picked them up as well.

Leslie Norins, MD, Phd, founded the Coding Institute in 1947 in Naples, Fla. Thousands of coders, physicians, and consultants have relied on the Coding Institute’s newsletters for practical coding information on 20 plus medical specialties. The beauty of SuperCoder.com is it offers medical code searching tied to more than 30 different medical coding tools and resources including articles from the Coding Institute’s Specialty Coding Alerts. Coders and researchers can find the information they need in one place making their workday more efficient. The tools reduce compliance risk and the trusted advice reviewed by top coding and clinical experts improves coding accuracy.  Many of the Coding Institute’s editors  have written Coding Alerts for almost a decade working with the same national consultants who serve on the CPT:registered: editorial board, ICD-9 advisory board, and specialty society boards. Direct knowledge of the rationales behind code changes and insurer policies allow the editors to explain medical coding, billing, and compliance from concepts to legal implication. Advice tells each subscriber how these rules affect the services and procedures a specialty provides. At SuperCoder.com, experts are behind every code change and tool. Jen Godreau, CPC, CPMA, CPEDC,  became director of the Website in Oct. 2011. She brings to SuperCoder.com 10 years of coding expertise including writing Coding Alerts, speaking nationally, and educating coders. She works directly with programmers to develop reliable, timesaving tools that serve subscribers’ needs. Under her directorship, the search has been made faster, tools easier to use, and facility coding tools added.
