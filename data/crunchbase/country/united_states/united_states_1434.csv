Moshe Schwartz didn't know that his little mattress workshop in Jaffa of 1948 would turn into the largest furniture group in Israel. When his son, Abraham, joined the business in 1956 he purchased new manufacturing machines, increased sales and distribution and coined the name AMINACH (My People Rest). In 1965, AMINACH moved into producing technologically advanced spring mattresses, beds and bedroom furniture and has since then been the largest manufacturer and distributor of furniture in Israel. Storage Beds chain caters the more demanding customers with the best of Aminach's products among which are brand names such as the Israeli made ""Optima"" and ""King Koil"" and the American ""Serta"" mattresses, the ""Swissflex"" adjustable bed, the ""Innovation"" beds and futons from Denmark, and of course, Aminach's bestselling ""Sapapa"" children and youth line of beds.  The Good Night chain target the mid level market segment and the bargain and ""Sales"" hunters.  The American Comfort chain specializes in imported recliners and living room sets.  Storage Beds retailers: several hundred retailers throughout Israel carry the Aminach products and are directly linked to our production and distribution center. These four chain stores along with the several hundred independent Aminach retailers make up the largest furniture sales and distribution force in Israel. Meticulously planning its growth for the new millennium, the Storage Beds purchased Cardo, the Hungarian furniture company, and transformed it into a leading manufacturer of sleep solutions in Hungary.

The company leverages the regulatory advantages of flight training with on demand flights to make private regional air travel convenient and affordable to a mass market. Learn to Fly Air uses an innovative experiential education approach designed to have broad consumer appeal. The problem is regional travel for distances between 100 and 500 miles is painfully inefficient and wasteful of time. Traditional airlines are inconvenient and all forms of private or semi-private air services are prohibitively expensive to most consumers. Learn to Fly Air solves this problem by offering custom air travel and flight instruction in fast, modern, 4 seat, piston powered aircraft. The service maximizes convenience and minimizes door-to-door travel times by utilizing a vast network of 5,000 mostly local airports. Combining custom air travel with flight instruction enables Learn to Fly Air to operate in a low burden and very flexible regulatory environment. Customers take a fun, low stress, and legitimate flight lesson on the way to their destination. Learn to Fly Air’s scalable platform matches customers with planes and instructors at specific locations and times of the customer's choosing.","Education, Transportation",2,"Elias MurrayMetzger, Jay Oshiro",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Our goal is to provide one place for content downloaders to find and purchase downloable content across a broad range of downloadable content categories. Our speciality is the ability to search for content across a wide range of content categories and find content among those categories that the searcher would not have found using other methods. We serve downloadable content only. If you need a UPS truck to get something, we can't help you. If you have credit and want immediate gratification and the content is legally downloable via the internet, we want to be your source. And, we want to do it right away, and easily for you. We believe we have the LOWEST price for eBooks on the internet. Since our website is totally automated and you download immediately once payment is approved, there is no shipping. If you find lower prices for eBooks on the internet, write us and we'll investigate. We want to be the Best Price. ContentRealtime offers several values to our users: 1. You can search and find downloadable content across multiple categories and suppliers in one easy to use website. (the ""Orbitz"" effect) Simply type a word or phrase into the SEARCH BOX on the home page and hit SEARCH button. We take major credit cards via secure PayPal. 2. You can refer friends and earn money for doing so. You do this by sending a friend an email invitation, either to a specific content item or a general ""please join"". When they register with ContentRealtime, we will log the fact that YOU referred them, and will track and you will earn a percentage of any amounts they spend through our website. The percentage is small, up to our discretion, and during beta is basically ""Monopoly money"" until we figure out the best way to incent you this way. This amount will be tallied and you can view it at any time under ""your account"". We reserve the right to forward this amount to you by check or cash, offset future purchases, or find other ways to give you the value you earned by referring friends. (the ""make money referring my friends to this site effect---aka Amway MLM effect). Simply INVITE a friend in the lower left portion of any webpage. Once they are invited and accept your invitation, we record that and track earnings for you, look on MY PROFILE on your account page to see this. 3. You can upload your own downloable content to our site, and offer it for sale. We split the proceeds of any sale with you 50/50. You MUST own the content you are uploading (either you created the content yourself, OR, you must have both the ""I own"" and the ""I can sell this downloadable content without any restraints or copyright issues or issues where someone else has an entitlement to either content or the value transaction you are creating by selling it via ContentRealtime"") (the ""eBay"" effect). Just UPLOAD any original content that you own and have the rights to sell and set a price for it. We track the sale, the fact that it is yours and send you 50 percent of the income once received from a fellow downloader. Hit the ""UPLOAD content"" box next to search or visit the YouContent category. 4. You can vote on content (use the star system) and you can comment and form communities here around the content you like. The FORUM link for community comments is on the lower right side of the main page. (the ""social"" effect). Go to the FORUM choice in the lower right of the screen, contribute to one of the already started FORUM topics or create your own. Also, you can VOTE on any content item when you are viewing the detail page about that content. Voting and buying content moves that content UP on the most popular and most recent tabs so others will benefit from your interests. FORUM topics can be a single content item (put the node link from that content item HINT: this means copy the browser address of the particular content item you are blogging about into your FORUM post and title the FORUM TOPIC so other users will find your comment and comment on your comment. We appreciate your interests. Thanks for your patronage and input to make this site more useful. We are focused on customer service and want you to have an enjoyable experience that allows you to consume content and become a better person and have fun!
