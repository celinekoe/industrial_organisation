Shall we use Marketo Segmentation or Workspaces / Partitions? •	Sometimes it takes much longer than expected for leads to sync with SFDC. What can we do about it? What are the fields we are syncing? No one seems t to know? •	We want to create business processes that integrate Marketo flows with our App or third party service. How shall we do it? SOAP API? Rest API? Munchkin API? Forms 2.0 API?

We have evolved from a small company into what we are today - the highest quality and most fun rafting company on the American River.  Our rafting and adventure trips reflect what we are passionate about. To date we have taken over 300,000 people down the American River and with 85% of our clients returning year after year, we must be doing something right! Many clients have expressed their amazement that a rafting trip entails so much more than just going down a river.  Rafting has long been plagued by the myth that it is dangerous, extreme and only for adrenaline junkies. Rafting is our profession, so we take it seriously. We are serious about safety, about good food, good times and very serious about fun! Our biggest safety feature are our world-class, certified, professional guides – you will appreciate the difference that they make especially with great attitudes and lots of character! We have an exceptional safety record on and off the river, and we like keeping it that way. We have three different rivers and three levels of adventure to choose from. We offer trips to suit all ages and abilities - it is not about fitness, it is about fun. Our youngest clients are the 6 year olds we take every day on the South Fork, and our most mature was a 76 year old on the North Fork!  This year American Whitewater Expeditions celebrates its 35th year as the premier whitewater rafting company in California on the American River. If you have been with us before, we look forward to seeing you again, if you have never been with us before, then come check out why were are the best. If you have never rafted before, we guarantee you will have a ton of fun and keep coming back for more!
