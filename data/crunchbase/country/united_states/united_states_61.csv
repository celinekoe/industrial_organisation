Below is a small brief of what we mean by fitting YOUR needs, No matter how specific your market place may be. The lack of computer knowledge to build their own website Lacking knowledge in web design, computer programming, marketing or all the above.  Many would find cheap solutions through different hosting companies and spend a great amount of money trying to bring the website online. This often resulted in the retailer giving up or just quitting altogether.  Some retailers would get lured into one of the many website schemes online, where the provider promised the retailer thousands of dollars in profits by going with their (provider's) solution. In conclusion the retailer would come to realize they have lost everything they spent on this solution and as you might expect, experienced a bad vibe of internet retailing.  A great majority of retailers signed up with variety of different Shopping Cart Providers which couldn't support the MimoUSA 100,000 parts data feed. These Shopping Carts not only lacked in technology to properly categorize all the products. But the automotive industry demands a completely different type of technology which would not only support options for products, but also makes, models and years. To get even more advanced wheel and tire sizes were not even considered.

For now, our primary focus is in designing applications for natural language immersion in virtual reality tailored to the the linguistic competence of each individual user. Our intent is to develop educational tools that specifically target vocabulary competence, the best indicator of overall academic achievement.  We are specifically interested in leveraging a variety of linguistic laws, like the Heap-Herdan law of vocabulary growth, to tailor and optimize the educational experience so that their vocabulary acquisition for each user is grown in solidarity. Hopefully this software can then be used to help correct the 70 point drop in verbal S.A.T. that occurred in the United States, in the years between 1957 - 1972 ,due to the national standardization of primary academic textbooks.

The company’s business is focused on the development of novel chemistry and genetic engineering methodologies for the modification of cyclic peptide-based compounds. Historically, structural modifications required to convert a native cyclic peptide into a functional drug often involved complicated and expensive synthetic chemistry approaches. This hampered the development of many promising drug candidates. It also prevented optimization (such as reduction of side effects) of many existing drugs. AureoGen is taking advantage of recent advances in medicinal chemistry to develop novel approaches that allow efficient, cost-effective modification, optimization, and production of cyclic peptide compounds. AureoGen’s chemistries allow many modifications (to cyclic peptides) to be introduced directly, without the need for the multiple synthesis steps, disassembly of the core ring structure, and re-synthesis of large portions of the molecule, that characterized older approaches. Similarly, advances in biology and genetics have produced tools and knowledge that allow efficient structural modification of cyclic peptides by (genetic) engineering of the non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) complexes responsible for their synthesis in the producer organisms. Thus, using state-of-the-art chemical and genetic engineering methodologies, AureoGen is producing novel cyclic peptide-based drug candidates that are new chemical entities (NCEs) and that have the pharmacological properties required for development into useful therapeutics. AureoGen’s methodologies allow for the efficient and cost-effective in-depth exploration of the pharmacological properties (structure activity relationships, SAR) of virtually any cyclic peptide, as well as simple and economical generation of entirely novel cyclic peptides.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
