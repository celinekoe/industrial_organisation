Their responses automatically generate different age ratings from each participating territory along with a generic rating for the rest of the world. IARC rating assignments also include content descriptors and interactive elements identifying apps that collect and share location or personal information, enable user interaction or share user-generated content, and/or offer in-app digital purchases.

Founded in 1993 as a consulting firm, Summitsoft worked with U.S. publisher's looking to expand into international markets and brought foreign developers into North American retail. By late 2001, it seemed a natural step to expand into publishing. With Summitsoft's extensive background and experience, the company achieved sensational growth, capturing an unshakable Top 10 position in business software sales for both the PC and Macintosh platforms. Fueled by successful partnerships with leading retailers, Summitsoft supports its strong distribution with products that show high sell-thru at retail, leading most NPD TechworldÂ® categories in rate-of-sale per outlet. Further heightening our success was the launch of Macware, Inc. in 2003, a Summitsoft company devoted to the interests of Macintosh users, which instantly attracted a wide audience in the Mac community. Macware is only eclipsed by three other giant publishers in the productivity category, and consistently holds Top positions in Mac business software. The company's headquarters and primary distribution center are both centrally located in Omaha, Nebraska. Summitsoft products are available through major retailers in North America, as well as Australia, Japan, Europe and the United Kingdom.

We transform leaders into business owners by focusing on leadership development, management training, and communications coaching.  We partner with highly respected companies nationwide by offering them professionally trained sales teams to represent their brand, improve name recognition, and expand market reach.  But why wouldn't these firms just do their own sales? By outsourcing to Opportunity Management Group, they save time, money, and increase their profit margins.  Instead of focusing on recruiting, interviewing, hiring, etc their own sales team, Opportunity Management Group hires our own team. That alone saves our clients hours of work where they can reinvest that in creating a better product for us to market. This also saves our clients money they would have put into hiring and training new teams and allows them to spend that elsewhere or lower the cost of their product, also making it easier for us to sell (win win situation again). Lastly, our clients do not pay us unless we produce results. Working with Opportunity Management Group becomes a clear no brainer for our clients. Now how do we make working with our team a no brainer? We promise only internal advancement opportunities that will be given based on merit and by hitting clear targets. Our clients have been pushing us to expand since late 2016, and while this is quite exciting, it is our job to ensure our team is ready to move into leadership and management roles where they will be solely responsible for one of our franchised branches.  Pushing our team to think bigger in their career is exciting. It is one of our greatest joys to see our team expand their comfort zones and try new things. Our firm is all about friendly competition and building each other up to new heights once not even imaginable.
