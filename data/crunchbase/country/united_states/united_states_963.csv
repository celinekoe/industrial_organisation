Our solution authenticates identity and applies a security policy - at the earliest possible time - before a network session is established to: •	Isolate, protect and segment resources from unidentified and unauthorized users, •	Stop cyber-attacks by blocking scanning and reconnaissance, and •	Protect against insider and 3rd party threats and provide attribution Designed to stop the kill chain, reduce risk, simplify compliance and increase operational efficiency by blocking or redirecting anonymous and unauthorized traffic at the earliest possible time.. The problem we address is that the TCP protocol leaks information, even behind firewalls, and IP addresses cannot be relied upon for identity.  Every network-connected application or device must establish a TCP connection before performing any client authentication.  This property of Internet transport protocols enables vulnerability scanning tools to identify which applications are present, develop signatures of the connected device, including the OS, release and patch levels, application vendors and version and patch levels. This information is then used to develop strategies to attack a user or system or to further penetrate an enterprise.  BlackRidge authenticates identity and applies security policy before session establishment, denying attackers and even insiders the information required to exploit vulnerabilities, and laterally spread in your network or cloud systems.","Information Technology, Privacy and Security, Software",2,"Bob Graham, John Hayes",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

That was the methodology CNA analysts first applied in the 1940s when they pioneered the field of operations research by helping the Navy address the German U-boat threat. Not content to study the problem from afar, this small group of MIT scientists insisted on deploying with Navy forces in order to observe operations and collect the data needed for meaningful analyses. Their groundbreaking work, and the anti-submarine warfare equations it produced, set a standard for operations research methods that CNA has maintained for 75 years. Today, with more than 500 professionals at their  headquarters and 50 researchers in the field, CNA still takes a multi-disciplinary, real-world approach to their work. On-site analysts carefully observe all aspects of a process—people, decisions, actions, consequences—and then collaborate with a headquarters-based research team to assess data and arrive at findings. CNA's objective, empirical research and analysis helps decision makers develop sound policies, make better-informed decisions, and manage programs more effectively. Their work, which in its early decades focused solely on defense-related matters, has grown to include investigation and analysis of a broad range of national security, defense, and public interest issues including education, homeland security and air traffic management.

To this end, representatives for the company are highly trained with respect to relevant legal and business considerations as well as proper consumer relations. This focus on training not only helps to achieve successful results, but also to maintain relationships that clients have built with their customers. To facilitate the company’s commitment to quality, its guiding principles have been condensed into a code of ethics known as its statement of core values. These values help to direct all actions taken by the company, allowing it to keep policies consistent with the philosophies built into its foundation. The core values focus on the five areas of people, integrity, performance, pride, and innovation. In a constant effort to encourage the following of ethical practices throughout the company, quarterly awards are given out to employees who best typify the core values in the workplace. In addition to the above areas of focus, the company also places particular emphasis on compliance and security. With a recognition that sensitive data must be safeguarded at every point possible, the company often opts for data compliance checks that exceed those used by competitors in the industry. These checks are audited by third-party specialist FRSecure and are performed by a team of qualified assessors who have a particular focus on the accounts receivable industry. One example of this commitment to additional security compliance is the company’s decision to conduct the PCI DSS 3.2 Report on Compliance rather than the more common, and less stringent, Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard self-assessment.","Administrative Services, Financial Services",1,John Erickson Jr.,501-1000,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Supply webs must be our next level of analytics for understanding and doing purposeful business within complex systems. Far greater efficiencies than any isolated chain can achieve could be the result, instead of supply chain failures occurring as the result of unknown bottlenecks in energy and resource flows.

The latter allows us to perform supply web optimization at low cost today until true quantum computers are ready tomorrow.

The driving ideas for this software came earlier, from the realization that the jewelry manufacturing industry really lacks a software system that can drive the processing of an order from beginning to the end. There were software packages out there that aimed to do this, but all of them were (and still are) either way to complex and expensive for the average manufacturing shop, or hard to use, requiring many clicks, data entry, search and reporting just to complete a simple order, thus wasting valuable production time.  Observing the manufacturing processes employed in jewelry manufacturing, we came to the realization that there must be a simpler way to do this - and surely, after doing our research on the existing systems and talking to industry representatives, we found the holy trinity of functions that would be condensed into our software: visual presentation, ease of use, and flexibility. With these three concepts as pillars we started working on this application and we called it PIRO (which is the acronym for Production and Inventory Routing Organizer - which is exactly what our system does). As a result of our innovative and forehanded thinking in 2016 we launched PIRO Fusion, the cloud version of PIRO.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Information Technology, Manufacturing, Software",1,Istvan Kozma,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Marathon focuses on the creation of small-volume, hard-to-manufacture medications that are often overlooked by larger pharmaceutical companies – in addition to its offices, Marathon recently announced the opening of the Marathon Bioscience Center in Chicago, which focuses on the development of treatments for cancer, central nervous system diseases, movement disorders, gastrointestinal diseases, and endocrine deficiencies. Marathon’s goal is to get therapies into the hands of patients who need them the most, all while ensuring the quality of their products. The staff at the bioscience center is composed of clinical, research, and regulatory staff who work in tandem to produce next-generation treatments for rare diseases. Outside of prescription medications, Marathon is also constructing a pipeline of treatments for rare cancers and neurological conditions. High-need, hard-to-manufacture medications do not reach the patient market overnight – Marathon’s team realizes this, and works with players from across the healthcare spectrum to deliver the best care possible. Two medications developed by Marathon in the barbiturate derivative class of treatments, Amytal Sodium and Seconal Sodium, assist patients in the short-term treatment of insomnia – these medications are nonselective central nervous system depressants and work by depressing the central nervous system. Aside from treatments for insomnia, Marathon also developed Opium Tincture and Pepcid, two medications that assist patients with gastrointestinal disorders. Pepcid is a histamine H2-receptor antagonist that reduces the amount of acid in patients’ stomachs, and Opium Tincture treats diarrhea.  The most widely covered treatment produced by Marathon, perhaps, is ZiNGO. This single-use, easy-to-administer powdered lidocaine device is used in pediatric patients before venous access (such as the insertion of an IV before surgical procedures.) This revolutionary device reduces the time needed to administer local anesthesia, so the device can be used during procedures. Marathon’s treatments have been used by thousands of patients nationwide, and will continue to assist those in need for years to come.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Manufacturing, Science and Engineering",1,Robert Altman,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
