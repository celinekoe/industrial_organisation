Currently, 65.4 million Americans suffer from one of these disorders, yet only 22 million receive the SLP treatment that they so desperately need, costing the healthcare industry nearly $20 billion in 2016 alone.  With the geriatric population expected to increase 50% (from 50 to 75 million) by 2030, the American healthcare industry will become increasingly overwhelmed due to a lack in human capital output (despite SLP job growth projected at nearly 20%).  Furthermore, a significant gap in therapy is created whenever a patient is discharged from their SLP, as they no longer have access to their activity regimen.  This absence of therapy regularly leads to cognitive and functional decline, resulting in one of five patients readmitting back to the hospital within the first thirty days of discharge.  Cortex solves this problem by providing dynamic and highly personalized therapy activities right on your mobile device.  By increasing therapy frequency and quality, Cortex may significantly increase the patient's progress (during therapy), therapy maintenance (after discharge), and the overall quality of life for everyone involved -- all the while driving down healthcare costs due to needless re-hospitilizations.",Health Care,1,Sky McClure,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
