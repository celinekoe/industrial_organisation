The Goodwill Ambassadors of Chocolate and Cacao are the Indigenous Peoples of colonial times, some of whom remain today! In 2019, Globcal International began to assert a disputatious legal claim stating that no company or person has more rights in the area of Theobroma cacao or Chocolate than the Indigenous Peoples that have been growing and harvesting cocoa beans since prior to the arrival of European influence in the South American region, in 2022 the research provided factual evidence for the claim to move forward. Their continuous use of Theobroma since prior to Columbus makes particular South American Tribes the global cacao and chocolate authority in law, sadly to say that all African Cocoa organizations are unlawful based on the Indigenous Origin and all European Chocolate makers are also operating unregulated by law. Our agenda asserts that all products that are not Indigenous Chocolate do not necessarily have the right to call themselves chocolate or cacao without making a tribute for the use of the genome from its origin, and that all Biocolonial Cocoa should be registered with them. They were growing Theobroma cacao and making chocolate snuff, beverages and flour when the Spanish arrived on the Upper Orinoco in 1533, by 1690 the Spanish had built missions and were exploiting the Indigenous Piaroa, Yekuana and Yanomami along with other Pre-Columbian tribes for the cacao that grew naturally in the Orinoco Valley, the missionaries did not have to establish encomiendas in this region, the tribes brought them the cacao from their forests to the river, it has always been this way.
