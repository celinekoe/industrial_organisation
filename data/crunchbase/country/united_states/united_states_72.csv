Tenvera,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tenvera,"Consumer Electronics, Manufacturing, VoIP","Franklin, Tennessee, United States",Brent Ware and Tim Akers see the rise of bandwidth-eating technology as the basis of a company they believe can hit $1 billion in sales,"2,146,693",Southern US,,Active,,,,,,,For Profit,http://www.tenvera.com/,"Brent Ware and Tim Akers see the rise of bandwidth-eating technology as the basis of a company they believe can hit $1 billion in sales within five years. The pair are set later this month to roll out Tenvera's System 5 Technology, which they describe as the first fiber optics system for inside the home. The first prototype house will be operational at the beginning of September in Tollgate Village in Franklin. Tenvera provides a home or office with fiber throughout, filling the gap left vacant by carriers and other firms. Those companies lay fiber down city streets and up to homes and offices, but not throughout the structure. Inside the home, and occasionally outside, is copper that can't handle high-bandwidth applications. ""Intuitively, that doesn't make sense,"" CEO Ware says. Earlier this year, Tenvera lined up $4 million in funding from Clayton Associates, a Franklin-based venture capital firm that has backed companies such as Ardent Health Services, Censis Technologies and HCCA International. With the financial infusion, Ware and Akers are laying the groundwork for a manufacturing firm that can put its products into the thousands of upscale homes built each year. Manufacturing of the system components is taking place locally, in Kentucky, Nevada and in China with its main test bed and laboratory in Franklin. While fiber optics inside the home wasn't a necessity in the past, Tenvera officials believe new technology products and consumer preferences require greater bandwidth that can't be serviced by copper wires and coaxial cables that became standard in most homes. Ware says that only a handful of channels can be played in high definition to televisions in a single home without using compression technology that impairs the quality. Meanwhile video servers are now playing movies and programs to high definition television sets that require fiber-quality bandwidth, creating bottlenecks. ""Every time we increase the bandwidth to the users, applications are developed to take up that,"" says David Wise, general manager at ISDN-Net, a Nashville-based company providing Voice over Internet Protocol and connectivity to businesses. ""We've seen it with dial up and broadband and T1 and fiber is going to be the same."" Ware and Akers hope to get the product into homes by aligning with home builders who are constructing homes with a value of at least $400,000. In those homes, fiber will be run during construction and set up for end users to easily attach their appliances for running. ""It is infinitely cheaper to do it when the walls are open than it come in three years alter and retrofit,"" Chief Operating Officer Akers says Read more: Tenvera bets on bandwidth hunger | Nashville Business Journal","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Information Technology, Internet Services, Manufacturing, Messaging and Telecommunications",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

While it can’t discuss specifics, the company says it’s in talks with a well-known streaming video brand. And it’s currently reaching out to others in the same market. To give you an idea of the clients RedHawk has in mind, streaming video services like Netflix, Hulu, or Boxee are the types of targets the company is interested in talking with. RedHawk would provide a way for these service to display links to restaurants via the screen that loads before you start the movie. For example, under the movie’s description, would be a simple option that read something like “Order Food.” Clicking the link would take you to a list of participating restaurants with online ordering systems. The way this interface would look and operate is up to the streaming video provider, as this would be a white label product only. However, RedHawk’s goal is not to function as an ad platform. That means local restaurants are not buying the links, or paying for a higher position. Instead RedHawk pulls from menu providers’ lists, and filters those by zip code in order to suggest the available restaurants to end users, along with delivery times and delivery areas. The customer would then be walked through a simplified online ordering system. RedHawk isn’t the final product name for the service, which has been in development since April.",Commerce and Shopping,1,Sean Davis,1-10,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,Gazelle Lab,,1,,Private,,,,,,
