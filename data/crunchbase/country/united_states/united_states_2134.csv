He has started a number of companies to commercialize various industrial applications of these materials. The fields of use include nuclear reactors, structural composite materials, machine tools, automotive components and others. In the late 1980’s he developed and patented a silicon carbide fiber that had an exceptional property of rapidly converting microwave energy to thermal energy. “Rapidly” means heating to over 1,000oC in 9 seconds in a common kitchen microwave oven. A potential application evolved with the US Clean Air Act requirement to install particulate filters on diesel engine exhaust by 2007. These filters required in-situ, high temperature cleaning on the diesel vehicle. Therefore, materials of composition must be ceramic or special metals. Industrial Ceramic Solutions, LLC (ICS) was founded in 1997 for the purpose of developing and commercializing a microwave regenerated diesel particulate filter (DPF), using the special silicon carbide fibers. Several million dollars in funding was invested by the US Department of Energy and several diesel engine manufacturers. As 2007 moved closer, ICS had developed an excellent ceramic fiber diesel particulate filter cartridge. However, the use of microwave energy proved to be unworkable. Significant worldwide interest in the ICS DPF cartridge and its ability to be regenerated by other acceptable heat sources caught the interest of several international Tier I automotive suppliers. In 2007, a Fortune 100 company signed an exclusive worldwide license to manufacture and sell the ICS DPF. This license agreement came to an end in 2008 with the depression of the diesel engine market through 2011.","Energy, Manufacturing, Sustainability",1,Richard Nixdorf,1-10,1,Seed,1100000,USD,1100000,1100000,USD,1100000,"Mountain Group Capital, XMi High Growth Development Fund",,2,,Private,,,,,,

CFA trains people to become licensed pilots. CFA has $8M a year in sales, 4 locations, a 30% profit, and several government requests to open additional flight training academies. With capital, or access to financing, we can tweak the business model and take profits from $2M/year now to $26M+/year in 24 months and to $50M/year by 36 months.  There is a demographically-driven global pilot shortage the will persist for the next 15 years, The industry is short 40,000 pilots today, and the industry only trains 13,000 pilots per year. 100% of CFA trainees who seek employment have job offers of $100-140k/year to start. Training takes about 12 months and does not require a degree. Interested students are everywhere. The problem is very simple: there is almost no student financing available for pilot training. CFA is seeking funding to change its business model to a CFA-financed, just-sign-here-and we will train you business model. We can instantly raise prices, double enrollments, place the students for a fee, and create an interest revenue stream multiplying profits the first year by 600%. During the same time we can expand our facilities and fleet allowing us to double/triple enrollment in years two/three for a total increase of profits of 2500%+ to $50M+/year in profits using very conservative assumptions. CFA has a mature management team in place, deep industry connections with dozens of airlines who have already agreed to participate in this new training/hiring model, an experienced sales team, an industry-recognized top notch pilot training program, and is currently a very healthy business.  With expanded capital or financing to offer student financing, we can multiply profits. This business is only missing the capital required to expand. Everything else is ready to go right now.","Financial Services, Transportation",,,1-10,1,,,,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
