Fashion Fund has built a database of 1000+ accredited investors who have expressed interest in its curated portfolio, which also exceeds 200 brands at launch. We plan to do 4-7 deals a month in our first year, 2018.  Asymmetry between consumer demand and the lack of fresh faces in the fashion and lifestyle business. Lack of capital, decline of department stores and rise of fast fashion is often attributed to why startup brands struggle. Fashion Fund solves for this by injecting metered growth capital into promising, content marketed brands that challenge traditional (safe) choices. Fashion is very influence and market driven. The wisdom and wallet of the crowds matter. We turn fans and customers into investors- a critical modality of funding for leading brands, especially those that are digitally native. Fashion Fund has a quant platform that matches startups with investor demand, based on scoring both to meet each other's unique requirements. Investment opportunities are scored on an 87-point dynamic checklist that tests their product-market fit, market readiness and business sophistication while the investor questionnaire qualifies their propensity and niche interests, thereby making better matches. Fashion Fund takes advantage of a SEC no-action letter that allows it to build an investor network without being a brokerage firm.

The cost per participant in a clinical trial can amount to tens of thousands of dollars and estimates indicate more than 8 million people participated in over 20,000 clinical drug trials in 2009. Clinical trials are the fundamental evaluation of safety and efficacy for a new drug. However, no one knows how many participants in clinical trials took their medications as prescribed. eTect has a solution: the ID-Cap. The ID-Cap includes a capsule with an embedded, ingestible wireless sensor and a wrist watch style reader. Each dose of medication is placed into an ID-Cap capsule, which emits a low power digital wireless message to the wrist watch after ingestion. The digital wireless message is then forwarded through the mobile web to the patient’s personal adherence record.
