It is increasingly easy to modify an existing pathogen to make it more lethal or transmissible, or design new viruses. We are not prepared for surviving a viral pandemic, major electromagnetic pulse (EMP) strike, or other disasters.  Many “survival community” businesses are growing in the United States, offering underground shelter and stockpiled food and emergency supplies to survive societal collapse.  Disaster Preparedness LLC (DP LLC), doing business as “Fortitude Ranch” , offers survival facilities in a different manner than competitors.  Our shelter communities are useful now as hunting, vacation, bed and breakfast, and resort sites:  “Fortitude Ranch: Prepare for the worst, enjoy the present.” This offers far more value to customers and more sales and profit for the business.  We have one location in West Virginia and a small recreation only site in Colorado that will be replaced by a full size Fortitude Ranch (FR) location.  With this small capital raise we will open up FR locations in CO and WI, purchase land for additional locations in NV and TX, and identify land and contractors for a total of 12 FR locations.  We will operate a few locations while waiting for the “Event”—a major media episode or disaster that spurs a jump in awareness of collapse threats and need for survival community protection. When this occurs we will immediately allow only higher margin long term memberships and quickly sell out the 12 FR locations and reap a huge return on investment.  We are an “Antifragile” investment since this capital raise goes primarily to land purchase and low cost buildings, which will likely appreciate in value.  If there never is any “event” that leads to huge sales and profit, our downside is return of capital by selling off our land and multi-purpose buildings.","Community and Lifestyle, Real Estate",1,Drew Miller,1-10,1,,710000,USD,710000,710000,USD,710000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Then, beginning in 2005, management focused on RCNâ€:tm:s strategic Northeast Corridor and Chicago markets, selling non-core assets including its 49% stake in Megacable, the largest cable company in Mexico, as well as its West Coast assets. With close to a decade of experience providing cable TV, Internet and phone service using fiber optics already under its belt, RCN again grew significantly in 2006. First, the company acquired Con Edison Communications (CEC), a subsidiary of Consolidated Edison, Inc., with its own fiber-optic network in New York City. The combination of CEC with RCNâ€:tm:s existing business services capability created the subsidiary RCN Business Solutions. Second, RCN completed a substantial network upgrade, including conversion to a 100% digital network. In 2007, RCN Business Solutions acquired NEON Communications gaining an advanced fiber-optic network stretching across twelve northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states. NEON was a wholesale service provider of high-bandwidth transport services to service providers and Fortune 100 companies. With this acquisition, RCN Business Solutions became RCN Metro Optical Networks, a leading facilities-based provider to medium and large carriers and enterprises in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and Chicago metro area.  RCN entered a new phase in 2008. Now equipped with two business units, Residential and Small Business and RCN Metro Optical Networks, serving three customer segments, the company continues to win customers in its markets. RCN is accelerating its movement to an all-digital video platform, enabling an increase in high-definition availability and improving picture quality to cable TV customers, and is continuing to offer the fastest high-speed Internet available with cable modem speeds that challenge industry standards. RCNâ€:tm:s past success stems from its foresight in acquiring, maintaining and growing its expansive fiber-optic network to serve multiple customer segments with an unwavering commitment to offering premium services with the very best in value.
