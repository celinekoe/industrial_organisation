But many people opt for cash back or gift cards instead because frequent flyer programs are too complex to sort though. People often don’t know which program to use or what airline to fly on to make the best use of their miles and points. There are a lot of rules that confuse people and discourage them from booking award tickets. And many are shocked when they see the taxes and surcharges levied on some of those tickets. That’s where we come in. We set out to make these programs simple enough for anyone to use. We have automated the research process and put all of the options in one place.To get started all you have to do is pick a destination and we will develop a strategy to get you there for the least amount of miles. Then we guide you through the process from registering for a frequent flyer program to booking the ticket. And we’ll help you track your miles and boost your balance so you can achieve your dream faster. We want to open up access to the best rewards to everyone.
