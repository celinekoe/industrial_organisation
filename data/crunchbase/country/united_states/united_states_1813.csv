PeeqMe fills a gap on profiling and collecting 360-feedback on ""how"" people work, not just what they did/accomplished. PeeqMe creates user profiles from their unique types, based on the most popular personality, behavior, and talent assessments. By focusing on what's special inside, the innate, natural strengths and styles of our users, peeqMe elevates engagement levels. Furthermore, peeqMe allows organizational values and behaviors/competencies to be added to profiles to catch members demonstrating how they work. By relating to their organization's intent, our members get caught demonstrating performance consistent with their affiliated organizations on a continuous cycle by customers, colleagues, management or partners (whether business, service, community, or faith-based). By creating circles of boosters, mentors and coaches, their fresh, frequent, focused feedback empowers our members. Furthermore, in a diverse and dispersed workplace, insights derived from rich but simple profiles reduces team conflicts from misuse and misunderstanding, and drives team performance to higher levels of productivity and innovation.

Morton’s neuroma occurs in a nerve in the foot, often between the third and fourth toes, and involves a thickening of the tissue around one of the nerves leading to the toes. Kesler Podiatry is prepared to offer the best treatment for foot neuroma and Morton’s neuroma for patients in Hawthorne. Morton’s neuroma causes a sharp, burning pain in the ball of the foot. Toes also may sting, burn or feel numb. When walking, it might feel as though there is a pebble in your shoe. People with certain foot deformities such as bunions, hammer toes, flat feet, or more flexible feet are at higher risk for developing a neuroma. Other potential causes are activities that involve repetitive irritation to the ball of the foot, such as running or court sports. An injury or other type of trauma to the area may also lead to a neuroma. Diabetic footwear, sometimes known as “depth shoes,” and custom molded shoe inserts can prevent many foot injuries caused by diabetes. The Medicare Therapeutic Shoe Bill allows qualified persons to receive protective footwear and inserts. This bill was instituted by the federal government to reduce complications associated with diabetes. The staff at our Hawthorne, NJ office is certified and trained to properly fit diabetic patients, mold the inserts, and dispense them to the patient. Properly fitted custom molded inserts and diabetic shoes can assure long-term comfort and decreased risk of complication to your feet from diabetes.
