VISION STATEMENT Our vision is to be a data-driven action oriented 501c3 non-profit that swiftly intervenes by creating a massive community response to protect and stabilize elderly and disabled victims living in communities impacted by natural disaster. MISSION STATEMENT Ground Force Disaster Response trains professional citizens with vital skills to protect and stabilize elderly and disabled citizens living in natural disaster impact zones by embedding into impacted communities for extended periods of time. A trained core team manages large numbers of professional volunteers with existing vital skills to provide a full range of physical and emotional care. From the ground, we use a data driven approach to establish a safe location, called SAFE Camp, in order to provide fast supply distribution and serve as a base of community care operations. We assess needs, then we quickly scale our efforts by utilizing social technologies to connect with and train professional citizens with untapped potential to join us in long-term sustainable rotating shifts to creatively assist the most vulnerable populations. Our teams consist of citizens with vital skills and untapped potential who have backgrounds in media and journalism, disaster management, social media influence, technology and systems, home repair, tree and debris removal, medical and mental health, incident command, first responders, nonprofit partners and FEMA training. We work with local community partners to build a coordinated program for full lifecycle case management for vulnerable populations beginning on day one in order to protect and stabilize vulnerable populations. Our core staff persistently seeks to deliver a quality experience for volunteers and to increase service capacity for our five core programs. - SAFE Camp (Swift Action Force Emergency Camp) - Community Caretaking - Data-Driven Remote Team - Visual Storytelling - Swift Intervention Training These programs' scale as volunteer numbers expand and they contract when it’s time to pull back as resources or needs dwindle. The programs work in unison to hasten recovery by utilizing storytelling to place vulnerable survivor's mental and physical needs at the center of focus for our large network of caring volunteers beginning as soon as an evacuation order is issued. With visual storytelling and social media, we make every viewer the neighbor of every survivor, and who wouldn't want to help their neighbor? Year round we seek corporate sponsors, foundation grants and citizen donations to fund our efforts.","Health Care, Information Technology, Media and Entertainment, Other, Professional Services, Sales and Marketing, Social Impact, Software",1,Rob Gaudet,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
