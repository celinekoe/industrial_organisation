Both iComment.com, Inc. and Skylam.com are subsidiaries of Quality Programming Corporation (QPros.com - established 1999). Mission iComment turns the entire Internet into a huge bulletin board forum. Their mission is to become the World's first social network based on web content, similarities in user's interests, and user's insights. Each day huge numbers of people use the iComment button to read and post their opinions, viewpoints, ideas, thoughts, advice and experiences to individual web pages and their content. iComment is based on a central database that ties together user's posts no matter what web page they post it to. The database is extremely relevant because our patent pending technologies enable iComment users to bind their posts to specific keywords or pictures on the web pages of their choice. iComment is based on a single button that appears on the Internet Explorer or Firefox toolbar and enables users to *read and write* comments about web pages as they surf the web from page to page.  Comments  can be made public or only visible to selected people chosen from your buddy list. Users can also access the Global Comment Database by visiting iComment.com and utilizing the iComment search engine. There users can read comments by entering any search term and starting a query. The search results can lead to valuable web pages and to valuable people that have similar interests. Examples of uses-  If you are planning to buy a product or service, use iComment to find out if the product is good. Is it available at a lower cost on another website? Does the seller honor their warranties? Do they ship on time? Is their service good? What was that ""secret bonus"" they sent you when you ordered? On a dating website use icomment to find out if the photo of that dater you are interested in is really her. How old is she really? Or, does HE really have a job? On an auction website comments may include what other bidders are thinking. Perhaps they will share how much they are going to bid? Or, if the seller is legitimate. On a news website use icomment to express your opinions about articles. Is it true? Is it gossip? Maybe you just want to gossip. That's okay too. On a support website use icomment to solve your technical problems. Read how others solved it. Add your own solutions to problems you solve to help others.","Commerce and Shopping, Information Technology, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Messaging and Telecommunications, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Our S-Corporation was formed by 8 small investors to fill a niche needed in the youth summer camp market.  Camps typically lose money for 3-5 years until they are established and have a track record with satisfied parents. Our numbers during the first two summers were low, but we are convinced the future will be bright and the camp will become profitable.  Our market is the teen looking for a specialty camp to meet his or her specialized  interest.  This year we are offering three such specialty camps…one in rock climbing, one in photography/video and a third in water sports.  Please see our website at www.ColumbiaGorgeTeenCamps.com.    We are looking for a partner or partners who can provide us with a bit of working capital and maybe some marketing know how.  This person should be someone who believes in the summer camp experience and is not just looking for a way to make a quick buck.   We see our venture  developing into a teen friendship center, where teens throughout the world gather to share an experience in one of the most beautiful outdoor settings anywhere.  There is a rapidly growing market of families in other countries that are looking for an experience which will help their son or daughter improve their English language skills in a 24 hour a day living situation.  Camp is ideal for that.  We are located 90 minutes from the Portland International Airport for easy access from anywhere on Earth.    Future plans call for expanding the number of specialty camps offered each summer and acquiring our own permanent camp site in this wonderful Columbia Gorge area.  If you are interested, please call our director, Jan Mayer at (801)  679-9099 to find out more about what we have planned.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment, Sports, Video",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
