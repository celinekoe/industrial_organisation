But for many, that is too difficult to attain.  One essential factor which greatly affects how fast our health declines is our lifestyle. The health choices and the activities we practice at sixty will have a great impact on our eighty’s.  So once we reach the age of sixty, we have to make sure that we know how to discipline ourselves and choose every healthy practice which each Non-Medical Home Care in Pennsylvania would recommend:   Eat Whole Grains. Whole grains would provide our bodies with carbohydrates just enough to give us hype throughout the day. The carbohydrates that this type of food brings to our body have a mild impact on our blood sugar- so you get the energy you need but you won’t harm your blood sugar levels at the same time. If you are a fan of bread and pastries, instead of eating those made of white and enriched wheat flours, shift to those made of whole grains.   Keep your Brain Working. Our mind is connected to our body. If our brain does not function properly, our body won’t. This is mainly the reason why we have to keep our mind alert to energize our body. We should not stop learning and stimulate our minds even after retirement. Through this, our body would mirror how our brain feels and become energized.   Stop the Vices. Bad habits die hard, they say. But if we want to keep our bodies at the great shape, we have to quit all our unhealthy habits like smoking and excessive drinking of liquor. Smoking does not only destroy our lungs; when one smokes a lot, our brains are slowly damaged too. Meanwhile, alcohol impairs the brain’s functioning and results in poor energy levels. We should end the notion of senior citizens being least energetic. We should make our choice- choose the healthy path and make every day of our senior years, a day full of life and vitality.
