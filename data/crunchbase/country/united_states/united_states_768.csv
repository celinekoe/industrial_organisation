In 1998, Joseph Pandolfino founded 22nd Century Limited, LLC (22nd Century) to provide funding to North Carolina State University (NCSU) for research and development collaboration on nicotine biosynthesis in the tobacco plant. Mr. Pandolfino questioned, coffee without caffeine and beer without alcohol is commercially available so why aren’t tobacco cigarettes without nicotine a choice for consumers? Further, he hypothesized: If it were possible to produce tobacco cigarettes without nicotine, smokers could use these extraordinary cigarettes to successfully quit smoking. A paradox to be sure. Nonetheless, Mr. Pandolfino’s hypothesis stemmed from his careful observation of real smokers. As an importer of tobacco-free herbal cigarettes, Mr. Pandolfino had come to realize that some consumers were using nicotine-free herbal cigarettes to successfully quit smoking. Anecdotal evidence suggested that this approach was actually effective. The biggest problem with the novel “therapy” was the fact that herbal cigarettes have distinct taste and aroma characteristics which greatly limit their consumer appeal and acceptance. Indeed, although various processes were developed to improve these nicotine-free herbal cigarettes, it became clear that their peculiar taste and aroma characteristics would never appeal to mainstream smokers. If, on the other hand, a tobacco cigarette without nicotine could be developed, Mr. Pandolfino believed a new cigarette category could prove an attractive product choice to all smokers. With this in mind, Mr. Pandolfino set out to investigate the feasibility of efficiently producing tobacco cigarettes without nicotine.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",1,Joseph Pandolfino,51-100,11,IPO,150781500,USD,150781500,170937750,USD,170937750,"Crede CapitalGroup, Crede CG III LTD",,2,1,Public,2011-02-04,,,XXII,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/22nd-century-group-ipo--ba599ee0,NYSEAMERICAN - NYSE American

Evocalize has built the first Collaborative Marketing Platform to enable partners to execute complex marketing programs together that can be run independently.  Evocalize is partnered deeply with Facebook and Google. ---------- Digital marketing continues to grow increasingly complex, which has paid large dividends in increased performance for large direct to consumer businesses. And, with digital advertising’s emerging privacy-first and cookie-less future taking center stage, the complexity of digital marketing will only increase.  Today, successful digital marketing programs are built upon three pillars: expertise, data, and technology. Large direct to consumer businesses often have all three key pillars, and reap the rewards. However, if a business is missing one or more of these pillars, they must enable collaborative marketing partnerships within, or outside of, their network to succeed.  Furthermore, if an organization has at least two of these pillars, typically data and expertise, they are well-positioned to create new revenue opportunities by enabling businesses in need with simple tools that grant access to performance marketing success in line with the largest direct to consumer (DTC) businesses. Collaborative marketing is an effective marketing strategy between a sponsoring partner (for example, a national marketing team, CRM providers, or marketplace) and a participating partner (for example, a local office, CRM user, non-DTC brand, or marketplace seller) that allows the execution of digital advertising programs using shared audience data, creative assets, messaging, and co-op budgets to achieve shared marketing goals. Collaborative marketing completes the three digital marketing success pillars - expertise, data and technology - for all partners involved.

Booker processes over one million appointments each month across 70 countries. Headquartered in New York City, Booker’s customers include Fortune 500 companies as well as thousands of local service businesses. HISTORY We started as a division of SpaFinder (located in Gramercy, NYC) in 2007 with a SaaS product called SpaBooker. Our focus was to deliver one platform for spas to manage their business, and SpaBooker was an instant success. We quickly expanded the team, feature set, and customer base. Building on our success, we decided to spin out SpaBooker to bring even more focus on growing the business by entering new verticals, and helping publishers add booking to their online user experience.  We realized this vision stretched beyond the name SpaBooker, leading us to spin out as GramercyOne, with SpaBooker as its product. Shortly thereafter, we brought on new investors in our Series A financing of $14.5M, enabling us to build out our executive team, enter several new verticals, and sign new partnerships with major publishers. Over the following year, as we continued our breakout growth, we recognized that our name was creating an unneeded divide between our company and our products.

Likarda's foundational technology is based on cell encapsulation and delivery in hydrogels using our patented Core-Shell Spherification® (CSS™) platform, an entirely new modality for the delivery of cell therapies.  There are no one-size-fits-all solutions because every cell therapy is unique.  Unlike technologies that utilize alginate or modify alginate, Likarda utilizes readily available and biocompatible hydrogel materials such Hyaluronic Acid, PEG, PVA, and a number of other chemistries to create microcapsules that can easily house cell-based therapies. Likarda’s large library of formulations enable matching the precise hydrogel to the cell therapy specifications. This can produce superior biocompatible cell-based treatments for either: (1) injectable cell therapies in a slow-release, degradable formulation enabling localization and increased efficacy, or (2) coating the cells in an immunoprotective barrier for injection/transplant for long-term treatments. CSS is versatile, enabling both durable and degradable versions, and can be applied to a variety of cell therapies.  Likarda is developing treatments for diabetes, osteoarthritis, and joint pain.  Our long-term platform is being utilized to deliver and protect islet-like cells for the treatment of diabetes.  This has shown success in small and large animal models and we’re continuing to conduct pre-clinical testing in spontaneously diabetic dogs.  Our short-term platform is being developed for osteoarthritis whereby encapsulated stem cells are injected into the knee and then slowly released over a 6-8 week period, bringing successful treatment of joint pain and reversal of the OA joint degradation. Along its many awards, Likarda was chosen as “One of the 50 Most Promising Start-Ups in the World” during Global Entrepreneurship Week.

The ultra-low-profile SX-One MicroKnife with Meerkat Technology is an innovative surgical device that enables physicians to perform Micro-invasive Carpal Tunnel Release surgery through a single micro-incision under ultrasound guidance, or with a traditional mini-open incision without ultrasound guidance.  The SX-One MicroKnife utilizes a micro-incision that’s up to five times smaller than the incision made during traditional CTR surgery—an incision so small, it can be closed with a small adhesive bandage or strip instead of sutures or stitches.
