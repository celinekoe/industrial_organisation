Customers can search for a translator(s) with the right background using the built-in search engine. With the translator selected, customers then make a payment upfront, which will be held in escrow, until the work is complete. The platform also displays customer-reviews and anonymous peer-reviews of each translator to provide customers with more information and to motivate translators do excellent work. This process cuts out translation agencies, saving considerably for customers while granting translators more income. It also creates more transparency and greater control over the customer’s choice of translator. For translators, the platform keeps them safe from fraud, ensuring that what’s due is paid. In short, translators that make more and are reviewed by customers and other translators have more incentive to provide the customer with top-notch service. It’s only getting easier to do business internationally. Your marketing and business communications need the subtle, cultural nuances to make your product stand out in the global space. Our team, which has all lived and worked in the US and China, knows first hand the problems and requirements for proper translation.
