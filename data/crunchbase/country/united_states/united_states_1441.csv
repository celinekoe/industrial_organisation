They place a biometric device (typically a fingerprint scanner) in a physician’s office to replace a conventional sign in sheet. BioClaim™ can also be used in conjunction with a smart card. When a patient enters the office, they will sign in using the biometric device by simply placing their finger on the scanner. They convert the biometric to a computer template. They never store the print so they are compliant with patient privacy. Also acquired during the visit is a patient identifier which is stored with the biometric id in their database. A registration code in the biometric device tells us which provider has which scanner. In every transaction they collect a patient identifier, a biometric print as well as a provider identifier (NPI or taxpayer ID), the date, time and location of the service. BioClaim™ has been under development since 2003. Development of BioClaim™ has always followed industry standards, giving users a choice of operating systems and hardware platforms. The market has since validated that foresight. Today, they still maintain hardware independence allowing their clients a wider choice of computer and operating system options including: all versions of Windows 32 bit operating systems and web browsers. They also allow a choice of networks that best meets your needs. BioClaim™ can be installed in a client-server network, a thin-client environment or be accessed via a web browser.","Health Care, Software",,,1-10,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,StartUp Health,,1,,Private,,,,,,
