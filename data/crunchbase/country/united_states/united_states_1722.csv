Hydro Pro Tubs,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/hydro-pro-tubs,"Construction, Home Improvement, Home Renovation","Overland Park, Kansas, United States","Hydro Pro Tubs, headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri, is a bathroom remodeling company who offers custom acrylic & fiberglass bathtubs.","1,849,471",Midwestern US,Less than $1M,Active,2003-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,http://hydroprotubs.com/,"Hydro Pro Tubs is a worldwide leader in state-of-the-art bath solutions. Primarily a manufacturer and distributor of high end bathtubs and spas, Hydro Pro also deals these products out of its own facilities located in Kansas City, Missouri. The company was founded in 2003.   Hydro Pro’s main product line consists of acrylic and fiberglass bathtubs and spas, each designed for high performance and rugged reliability. Built from the finest quality materials and manufactured according to the most stringent global standards, the company’s bathtubs and spas boast of the latest and most advanced technological features. They are ideally suited to the demands of modern homeowners, and offer outstanding performance and reliability.   Just recently, Hydro Pro announced the addition of a new feature that is aimed at enhancing the performance of its products, giving them added versatility and functionality. The new feature is a heated seat option called Hydro Heat. Providing a unique and totally relaxing bathing experience, the new feature gives users all the benefits of a fully-equipped, world-class spa right in the comfort of their own bathroom. This is a revolutionary feature that is normally available only in the highest priced units on the market, and the fact that Hydro Pro has made it available at such an affordable price makes it an even more attractive option.   Hydro Heat essentially heats the backrest, armrests, seat, and floors of the acrylic and fiberglass bathtubs and showers offered by Hydro Professional, making for pleasant overall experience. Flexible and extremely durable, Hydro Heat is also one of the safest options of its kind on the market today.   Yet another reason why this is such a valuable add-on is the fact that Hydro Heat uses up much less energy than similar features offer by other bath solution manufacturers. In fact, Hydro Heat uses up even less energy than the typical light bulbs used in homes. With its hermetically sealed, reflective foil/foam insulation, and state-of-the-art heating elements, Hydro Heat reinvents the already innovative products of Hydro Pro.   Merging high-end technological features, modern conveniences, and affordability has always been part of the Hydro Professional business model. The company was established with the goal of providing the consumer market with high-end products brimming with cutting-edge features that are normally available only in units costing many times as much. This is par for the course for the Kansas-based firm, which has always striven to provide exceptional value to its valued customers.   Ever since the company was founded, it has always worked in the principle of superior value at low cost. Many of its products in fact feature innovations that go well beyond the standards established for consumer-level products. With the level of technology and innovation found in Hydro Pro’s bathtubs and spas, even the most discriminating residential users will have no need for any other product, even as their needs grow.   Such a string of accomplishments hasn’t gone unnoticed in the industry. Despite its relatively short history, the company has garnered widespread acclaim among its peers and even its competitors. In fact, Hydro Pro has become an industry leader in its own right, setting the pace for others in the industry to follow.   Of course, raising the bar with pioneering products and services serves to benefit the consumer the most. Over the years, the company’s customer base has grown by leaps and bounds, necessitating an expansion in the firm’s facilities. For this reason, the Hydro Pro management recently made the decision to move the company’s center of operations to new facilities in the South Kansas area. The new facilities cover an impressive 5,000 square feet of space, which is a clear sign of its huge growth and expansion.   This new location now houses the offices of Hydro Pro’s staff and administration, and a fully equipped call center department. One of the most significant additions to the company’s operations, the call center was established in order to address the growing global demand for the company’s products and services. With the addition of the call center, Hydro Pro is now able to address international customer concerns and handle foreign orders with the same professionalism and attention to detail with which it is able to deal with local customers.   The call center is just one aspect of the company’s focus on addressing increased market demand for Hydro Pro’s products and services. Also part of the new facilities is a small but fully-equipped distribution warehouse that was set up in order to ensure a ready stock of quality items in its inventory. With this new distribution warehouse, Hydro Pro is already more than able to handle current demand.   Never a company to rest on its laurels, Hydro Pro and its management already has its sights set on the future. Company executives anticipate even more growth for the company in the coming years, and as such, have already set about developing means to address future needs. In the same premises where the company’s headquarters are located, an even larger distribution plant will be built.   The rationale behind the planned distribution center is explained by the company president. “The market for our products is growing all the time,” he said. With the new distribution center, the company ensures its continued ability to handle the needs of an even larger global market. Construction of the new distribution center is set for completion later in 2016.   Addressing customer demand is only part of the reason for the ongoing expansion. In recent years, the company has expanded its personnel base considerably, with more and more floor space required to accommodate the new employees joining the Hydro Pro workforce all the time. The company has in fact become one of the largest employers in the Midwest, with its hiring rate increasing exponentially over time. With the larger facilities, Hydro Pro is not only able to provide adequate space for its employees, but ensure more consistent and better quality services as well. As the president of the company said, “We are proud to be able to provide jobs for many people across the nation, as well as locally.”",Real Estate,1,Chris Dhooghe,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
