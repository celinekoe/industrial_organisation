What began as a homemade remedy quickly became a standard hospital supply, and finally, a growing business. Together with her brother, Roy Nichols, Wendy founded Soothing Scents: a small but big- hearted establishment that produces essential oil inhalers designed with the safety and science that healthcare environments demand. Today, our flagship blend QueaseEASE is used in over 1,000 hospitals and thousands of homes across America, by expectant mothers, boaters, nervous air travelers, road trip enthusiasts, deep sea divers, frequent flyers, chemotherapy patients, and those looking for a natural way to achieve mental focus and a better way to relax.",Health Care,,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
