We specialize in the production of the HiLumz® Diamonz® Retrofit Kit. The kits provide commercial and industrial customers with an LED solution for their existing Metal Halide, High Pressure Sodium or High Intensity Discharge (HID) fixtures.  Market: Designed to retrofit commercial and industrial 100 Watt to 1,000 Watt light fixtures, HiLumz customers keep their existing fixtures and simply replace the bulb and ballast with an LED solution. Primary applications for the 40 Watt to 360 Watt LED retrofit kits include lighting of parking lots, street lights, warehouse high bay fixtures, wall packs, garage and gas station canopy lights and commercial flood lights. Virtually 95% of the high intensity light fixtures in use today are candidates for the Diamonz LED retrofit. The LED lighting industry is experiencing staggering growth. An article on Forbes.com, states ‘…Currently, LED lights occupy 18% of the $66 billion global lighting market. According to industry data cited by GE, this share of LEDs is expected to rise to 70% by 2020, when the global lighting market is forecast to reach about $100 billion…’. (http://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2013/06/11/ge-lighting-sees-brighter-future-with-led-growth/) Positioning:  As a manufacturer of LED products and not simply an importer/reseller, HiLumz is well positioned to exploit the industry growth. Most other LED lighting manufacturers, including those with a global presence, offer only complete fixtures. While HiLumz does offer complete fixtures, our primary product offering of retrofit kits allows fixture owners to keep their existing fixtures, convert to LED for lower costs than buying a complete fixture, avoid permit and architectural approvals and standardize on a single product for a variety of fixture types.",Manufacturing,,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
