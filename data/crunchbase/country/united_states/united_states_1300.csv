Things like, training location, team flight, a welcome video, photos, and more! They can also see some really useful coach information like coach gender, coach license type, and a series of tags that highlight the areas the coach specializes in.  Sports Bridge helps coaches have a much better online presence. Currently, individual teams are hidden or buried deep in the club’s online directory and coaches rarely have customizable assets for these directories, with Sports Bridge individual coaches can really put their best foot forward with their team profiles and show off what makes them great. With Sports Bridge coaches can create their teams in minutes, post a recruitment listing and sit back and watch their requests come in. Once those requests start coming in, coaches can manage them in the dedicated requests tab in their dashboard. They can add notes, change tags, and see all the parent information, no more scanning through messages trying to remember who’s interested in a tryout or not.  Parents with the help of useful filters have the ease to simply search for what they are looking for, not what Google thinks they might be interested in, or what the Facebook algorithm deems useful for them. With Sports Bridge, parents can truly do their due diligence on teams they are interested in before enquiring about a tryout. They can open a side-by-side comparison view of up to three teams for at-a-glance viewing, save their favorites and easily send a tryout request all at no cost to the parents.  Never before have we seen coach information for a youth sports team. A coach can make or break a youth sports team and there’s so little information about individual teams’ coaches and what little information you can find is either outdated or not relevant. Sports Bridge is changing that and improving the youth sports industry for the better.","Software, Sports",2,"Ben Knights, Britt Hildebrand",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
