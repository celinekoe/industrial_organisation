The method, known as Oxidative Hydrothermal Dissolution (OHD) is simple, using only hot (subcritical) liquid water and oxygen to break down these macromolecular organic materials into their constituent aromatic and aliphatic compounds. The OHD process can also be used for environmental remediation of organic-containing sites, such as oil sands tailings and coal waste ponds. This modular, environmentally–friendly process produces very little CO2, giving the technology a low carbon footprint. OHD requires no pre-treatment of the feed, or additional catalysts, enzymes or solvents (other than water). The OHD bioliquor can be used as a fulvate-type biostimulant and soil enhancer, and high-value, platform biochemicals can also be recovered as saleable products through an add-on option to the main conversion process. The product suite depends on the choice of feedstock and the process conditions. Thermaquatica’s goal is to use OHD technology to produce chemicals similar or identical to petroleum-derived products, using low-cost alternative raw materials such as waste biomass or coal. The resulting products can be sold as fine chemicals, used in manufacturing of biodegradable plastics and polymers, and/or converted to liquid fuels. The OHD technology is described in more detail on the Technology tab from the menu above, and the process is also described in a short video clip in the Media section.","Agriculture and Farming, Biotechnology, Natural Resources, Real Estate, Science and Engineering",1,Ken Anderson,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Hughes Plastic Surgery,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/hughes-plastic-surgery,"Education, Health Care","Los Angeles, California, United States","Dr. Kenneth Hughes (Dr. Kenneth Benjamin Hughes) is a Harvard-educated, Harvard-trained, board-certified plastic surgeon in Los Angeles","1,867,790","Greater Los Angeles Area, West Coast, Western US",,Active,2012-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,https://www.hughesplasticsurgery.com,"Dr. Kenneth Hughes is a Harvard-educated, board-certified plastic surgeon in Los Angeles. Dr. Kenneth Hughes achieved the highest level of education and elite training prior to practicing in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills. Dr. Kenneth Hughes received his honors degree from Harvard University in 1999. He graduated from medical school in the top 5% of his class and scored in the top 1% nationally on his licensing boards. He was awarded entrance into one of the very selective integrated plastic surgery programs, in which he received extensive training for six years in the vast array of general and plastic surgery procedures. From residency, Dr. Kenneth Hughes was selected as only the second plastic surgeon to pursue a year long aesthetic and cosmetic surgery fellowship at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Hughes has authored numerous papers and textbook chapters on cosmetic surgery topics including face and neck lifts, rhinoplasty and nose surgery, breast augmentation, fat grafting, fillers, scars and scar revision, the preoperative workup for plastic surgery, and photography in plastic surgery. Dr. Kenneth Hughes specializes in performing virtually scarless or minimal scar surgery for the face, nose, and breast. Some of these techniques include short scar face lift, facial fat grafting (facelift technique without visible scars), closed rhinoplasty (no visible external scars), chin implants with no external scar, short scar tummy tuck, and TUBA (breast augmentation without scars on your breasts). In addition, Dr. Kenneth Hughes performs the entire array of plastic and cosmetic surgery procedures. He performs breast augmentation through any incision possible, breast lift, breast reduction, brow lift, upper and lower eyelid surgery, liposuction, liposuction revision, tummy tuck, Brazilian buttlift or BBL, butt implant, silicone and hydrogel removal, removal of fat necrosis (fat death or dead fat), mommy makeover, body lift, arm lift, thigh lift, labiaplasty, and vaginoplasty.  Dr. Kenneth Hughes has a great deal of experience in performing multiple procedure cases (tummy tuck, breast augmentation) or (facelift, upper and lower eyelids) or (breast augmentation, liposculpture).  If you want to have multiple procedures performed, Dr. Kenneth Benjamin Hughes, MD is the plastic surgeon for you.  Dr. Kenneth Benjamin Hughes performs multiple procedure surgeries every day, sometimes several times a day.  How does this benefit YOU, the patient? This means Dr. Kenneth Benjamin Hughes can perform multiple procedures efficiently, effectively, and safely. While some plastic surgeons may take 5 or 6 hours to perform a tummy tuck and breast augmentation, Dr. Kenneth Benjamin Hughes routinely performs these surgeries in under 2 hours. This means that Dr. Kenneth Hughes saves you 3 hours of general anesthesia. The risks of prolonged general anesthesia are manifold. The extra time can put you at increased risk of blood clots, which can travel to the lungs and cause respiratory compromise and even death. The risk of infection and hypothermia as well coagulopathy (bleeding) increases. The list goes on and on. In addition, Dr. Kenneth Hughesis a consultant and lecturer for the Institute for Safety in Office-Based Surgery (ISOBS), a nonprofit patient safety advocacy organization started by Harvard professors. Don’t forget that in addition to preserving your health, Dr. Hughes’s faster operating times translate into saving you money on anesthesia and operating room costs. However, Dr. Kenneth Benjamin Hughes never compromises on quality and the result of your plastic surgery as evidenced by his Before and After Photo Galleries. Dr. Kenneth Benjamin Hughes specializes in performing virtually scarless or minimal scar surgery for the face, nose, and breast, and he offers the most advanced technologies available including fat grafting with stem cell rejuvenation.  Some of these techniques include short scar face lift, facial fat grafting (facelift technique without visible scars), closed rhinoplasty (no visible external scars), chin implants with no external scar, short scar tummy tuck, and TUBA (breast augmentation without scars on your breasts). In addition, Dr. Kenneth Benjamin Hughes performs the entire array of plastic and cosmetic surgery procedures.  He performs breast augmentations through any incision possible, breast lifts, breast reductions, rhinoplasties, facial fat grafting, brow lifts, face lifts, upper and lower eyelid surgeries, chin implants, liposuction/liposculpture, tummy tucks, butt lifts and butt augmentations, mommy makeovers, arm lifts, thigh lifts, labial rejuvenation, and so much more.","Education, Health Care",1,Dr. Kenneth Hughes,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
