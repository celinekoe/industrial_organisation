The DecentraX (DCX) blockchain is being built from the ground up by designing the proprietary hardware that runs the network around blockchain needs. To-date blockchains are built on top of existing hardware that was not necessarily designed to effectively operate for this industry. Minmaster Chips are designed from the ground up around processing hashing algorithms, to effectively allow for increased Transactions Per Second (TPS). The goal for the DCX team will be to meet and exceed 1,000,000 TPS on the DCX Network. The blockchain will grow out with each new project that is adopted into the DCX Network, starting with a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) that will aim to resolve ease-of-use and liquidity problems seen with the options currently available to the market. DCX will act as the gas of the exchange, as every swap that occurs will be paid for in DCX. The DecentraX team believes that DEX trading is the future and will free projects and investors from the chains seen with centralized exchanges.","Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Hardware, Other",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

When he saw a need in Southwest Florida for charitable outreach, he reflected on the many blessings in his life and decided it was time to act.  Khleif and his brother, Ed Jacobs, organized the Tiny Hands Foundation in November 2001. Khleif serves as the foundation’s president. For more than 12 years, Khleif and the Tiny Hands Foundation, a 501-C3 charity, have focused on serving families in need all throughout the Sarasota, FL area.  After delivering huge holiday meals in gift baskets to five different underprivileged families, Rod Khleif knew that he had hit on a worthy endeavor. Seeing the smiles that his charity brought to children in need, and the tears of gratitude in their mothers’ eyes, Khleif awakened his passion for humanitarianism. Over the past, years, the Foundation continues to sign up new clients. Through its annual Basket Brigade, the foundation seeks to help impoverished children and their families by delivering full holiday meals every Thanksgiving. More than 20,000 holiday meals have been delivered, with the assistance of a dedicated cadre of volunteers. Each of the gift baskets is delivered with both a complete holiday meal and a note reading simply, “This is from someone that loves you.” With these small gestures, Rod Khleif has been improving lives throughout his community for over a decade. The Tiny Hands Foundation goes beyond distributing food baskets at Thanksgiving.  Khleif said that although it is gratifying to see a smile on the face of a child as a result of a holiday food basket, there is a bigger picture to helping the needy. The foundation’s larger focus is on fostering awareness on core values such as emotional mastery and personal development to break the cycle of poverty.   This year’s Annual Basket Brigade on December 21, 2013 marked the 12th Annual Basket Brigade since the founding of the organization. Khleif and his colleagues have high hopes for the event this year, with their goal being to feed 1,500 impoverished children and their families throughout the Sarasota, FL area.","Community and Lifestyle, Other, Social Impact",1,Rod Khleif,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
