The last thing you want to do is rummage through your closet, turning your bedroom upside down in an attempt to find the perfect outfit.   Before founding Style Baby OMG Boutique, Jazmine Rodriguez was a busy, on-the-go woman who loved fashion but never had time to create truly exceptional outfits. She recognized the need for fuss-free clothing that consumers could trust.   In the pursuit of her dreams, she launched an online fashion store with only $500, but what she lacked for in finances, she made up for in passion. Eventually, she graduated from her bedroom and acquired an office, granting her the physical and mental space to take Style Baby OMG Boutique to the next level. Today, her top priority is taking your style to new heights, as well.  Our collection of trendy, high-quality pieces are designed with you in mind. Here, you’ll find an outfit for any occasion, whether you’re going on a night out or out to brunch with your girlfriends, allowing you to finally say goodbye to the frustrating “I have nothing to wear” days.  Outstanding customer service remains a cornerstone of Style Baby OMG Boutique. We are proud to create a community that not only wants you to look your best but feel your best every single day.

Reviresco Corporation,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/reviresco-corporation,"Energy, Fuel, Renewable Energy","Duluth, Georgia, United States",Reviresco Corporation sees a substantial opportunity to divert MSW from landfill disposal utilizing the Company’s industry-disrupting.,"2,231,238","Greater Atlanta Area, East Coast, Southern US",Less than $1M,Active,2011-10-31,day,,,,,For Profit,http://www.revirescocorp.com/,"Reviresco Corporation sees a substantial opportunity to divert MSW from landfill disposal utilizing the Company’s industry-disrupting process to convert the energy-rich fraction of MSW into valuable biomass fuel and deploying the resulting fuel in a highly synergistic gasification and electricity generating plant. The term “reviresco” is a Latin word meaning “to grow green again, to be renewed”, a particularly appropriate representation of their core business.     MSW disposal in the United States is an $8.3 billion industry. Most waste goes to landfill (53%), for which waste generators, mainly municipalities, pay tipping fees, which now average almost $50/ton across the nation and have been rising at rates of nearly 3.5% annually for the last 12 years. More than 30 states are experiencing rates higher than $50/ton including ten states that contain 40% of the US population now have tipping fees at or exceeding $75/ton. Six states have fees in excess of $100/ton. Reviresco will earn tipping fees for waste disposal in lieu of landfill operators.    Reviresco emerged from more than 5 years of research into waste disposal alternatives and more than $5 million in R&D investment, which together led to the construction of a pilot (proof of concept) plant in the United Kingdom that established a cost-effective and energy-positive system for separating and converting the organic component of municipal and other wastes into usable products.     A single Reviresco system can of process 30,000 - 50,000 tons of unsorted, unprocessed municipal waste (from households and some institutional and commercial operations) annually, diverting more than 85% of the waste from landfill disposal.     Reviresco presents an efficient, unique and cost-effective solution to the complex and growing problems of waste disposal for cities, towns and counties in North America and worldwide.    Each Reviresco plant will earn investment-grade returns with guaranteed revenues from governments and major utilities.","Energy, Sustainability",,,1-10,1,,,,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
