Cuff owed the 5 separate companies over 1.2 million dollars (in addition to some others who did not join the suit). According to our lawyers that was the only way to force Cuff Inc. to open their books to the court so we can investigate though a 3rd part court appointed lawyer  if the company misappropriated funs or had any wrong doings. Cuff Inc.  and thier investors were hoping to just claim insolvency which would have allowed them to skulk away quietly. By forcing them into bankruptcy the hope is that they will be forced to let the court and eventually our lawyers see where all the money went and if the way the company was handled at the end followed the law.  Also I am correcting the below misinformation about my company- My company Volume & Tone LLC  (parent Company) and my consulting group LANE TABB ACCESSORIES GROUP  did all the  design development, sourcing, and Manufacturing for  ALL of the actual Jewelry and leather pieces, We  spent a year getting her ideas to be working jewelry and fashion leather pieces, manufactured them with our partner factories, shipped every piece that was on pre- order and ordered for target and Amazon and extra stock to Cuff's warehouses so that they could ship. And then they disappeared, After we had paid  for the last shipment to our factories with our own money.  The damages to our business currently totaling more than you can imagine which we may file a Civil case this Fall. There is a lot more to this story, and I have been quiet for the past few months as we have been collecting information both for lawyers and myself- But I am currently in the process of  an article about our experience with the Cuff  Product Launch, Working with a Tech startup gone wrong,  as well as  interesting information about the main investment firm who may or may not have caused the demise intentionally, and a cautionary tale for both Investors and small businesses.  The following message appears at Cuff.io,""Unfortunately Cuff is no longer in business and therefore will not be able to fulfill any outstanding orders or process any refunds. If you are currently a Cuff customer your product should continue to function, however there will no longer be any customer or technical support."". The announcement was unexpected, as the first generation & second generation devices can still be found for sale through online retailers like kohls.com target.com & was previously featured on Groupon.  A former vendor charged with designing and hand crafting some of the letter pieces the Cuff module fits into, Elena Tabb of Volume & Tone based in NYC, says her and another vendor have filed a suit against Ms Sood & Cuff for $1.2 Million USD, as these vendors allege they were not paid for their work or materials.  As this case makes it way through the court system, many customers,fans, & backers are left with more questions than answers.  Please Note:POST-CLOSURE DEVICES ARE NOT RECCOMENDED FOR PURCHASE AS APP FUNCTIONALITY, DEVICE SUPPORT, CONNECTIVITY, ETC ARE NO LONGER SERVICIBLE.  The purpose of this device was arguably one that needed to be designated as medical and regulated by the FDA-as such, without FDA approval, and since the company no longer offers assistance in anyway, please do not rely solely on these Cuff modules for health and safety reasons.  One user who purchased from a 3rd party site reported an inability to create an account or setup her device after downloading the app on compatible devices with Android and iOS respectively.  Elena suggests that core Cuff personnel aren't remorseful and one in particular was said to have been given a VP of Finance position elsewhere despite allegedly ""mispending $7.5 million in 8 months."" Less than 1 year prior to closure, Cuff was announced as having inked a deal with XFINITY HOME, Comcast's connected home solution also featuring Skybell, Rachio, Whistle, Automatic, & August.   [Depreciated]Cuff is a new line of jewelry wearables that serves as an alert system for family and friends. The collection consists of bracelets, necklaces and key chains. The line is meant to be unisex, and offers options for both men and women. Each piece is anchored by a small rectangular component called the “CuffLinc.” This acts as an alert system of sorts for family and friends. CuffLincs can be removed and tucked into any of the pieces in the Cuff collection. Using bluetooth technology, the CuffLinc will connect to your phone via Cuff’s app. If A wearer squeezes the Cuff, an alert will go to the designated people in the wearer’s network. If anyone in the network is wearing a Cuff, their Cuff will vibrate. If they don’t have a Cuff, they will receive a push notification to their phone with the alert with the location of the sender. You can set up which of your contacts will get an alert via the startup’s app, which also holds personal and medical information like blood type, health issues and more. Users can also program their Cuffs with different alerts for people (i.e. three taps to alert my babysitter, one tap for my husband).","Clothing and Apparel, Consumer Electronics, Consumer Goods, Design, Hardware",1,Deepa Sood,1-10,2,Early Stage Venture,5000000,USD,5000000,5000000,USD,5000000,"New Enterprise Associates, Tandem Capital, Tugboat Ventures",1,3,,Private,,,,,,

The History Behind LocationSmart  Originally, LocationSmart was founded under the name of TechnoCom Corporation in 1995. Its initial goal was to help wireless carriers with their mobile location requirements. Because of its innovative products and services, Deloitte chose TechnoCom as one of the top 50 fastest growing tech companies in Los Angeles for four years in a row.  In October 2010, LocationSmart was developed as a division of TechnoCom Corporation. Since it was initially founded, LocationSmart has worked to help people and businesses around the world with location-based services. This company currently has the largest American footprint of any business for location-based services. To make user adoption even easier, the company has pioneered innovative methods for gaining privacy consent.

LocationSmart's location-as-a-service platform also helps companies improve their customer engagement and security.

Because of this, the device profile can help companies validate their returning customers and halt cybercriminals. This technique uses real-time risk scoring and behavior analytics to determine which devices may pose a risk for a company's security. With the geofencing and privacy features, businesses can ensure their clients' privacy and create geo-relevant campaigns. Geofencing helps companies create a radius for providing ads and other services. With LocationSmart's privacy features, businesses can include consent controls and reminders for their users.

Development efforts are currently underway with the time to first release estimated to be 18 to 24 months. TempoQuest’s suite of software solutions are being designed to run on graphic processor unit accelerators (GPUs) instead of CPUs, dramatically increasing the speed and accuracy of analysis.  Though GPU accelerators are currently in use for other ‘big data’ applications, the technology has not yet been applied to comprehensive weather data analysis. As currently practiced, satellite sensors, drones, radar, etc., will continue to collect global weather data. TempoQuest will then process this data and provide it to today’s major specialist weather companies, such as The Weather Company, AccuWeather, and others. For several of their high-value end users, like commodity traders, insurance firms, power utilities, major agricultural companies, etc., speed and accuracy are critical to the success of their businesses and an extremely valuable asset.  The expenses for this business are relatively modest as the main cost is continued development and maintenance of the software. Sales channels are current commercial providers of weather forecasts.

Though Ursuline’s admissions don’t discriminate on the basis of religion, the school’s Catholic heritage is a fundamental part of student life. Spiritual growth is one of Ursuline College’s goals for its students, and to help meet this goal, the campus ministry holds a weekly mass and provides opportunities for community service. Ursuline’s academics break down into three divisions: the School of Arts and Sciences, the Breen School of Nursing, and the School of Graduate and Professional Studies. The college is liberal arts based, but it does offer two BFA/BA programs in Art Studio and Art Visual Communication Design. As of 2010, Ursuline began its first doctoral program in Nursing Practice. The Ursuline College Accelerated Program (UCAP) is designed for working adults. Students in UCAP can earn up to 27 credits per year, taking classes in the morning, afternoon, or evening.
