There’s nothing worse than not being able to get the rest you need. While regular sleep masks can block out light, they don’t have the ability to help you get to sleep. Nothing replaces the comfort of your very own pillow and pillowcase. That’s why the nodpod was designed: to take your relaxation to the next level, not to take away from the coziness already offered by your bed. Order a nodpod sleep mask and experience deeper, more restful sleep today. Whether you have trouble dozing off at night, are awoken by sunlight in the morning, or are in need of a really good nap, the nodpod sleep mask can help you get the rest you need. Our elongated sleep mask easily attaches to your pillowcase, allowing you to enjoy the soft and reassuring comfort of your very own pillow. It’s always by your side, making it easy to locate when you need a little help getting to sleep. It doesn’t matter if you prefer to sleep in the same position every night or enjoy switching it up ─ the nodpod is long enough to comfortably reach any sleeping position. Not to mention, it’s gentle weight helps keep it in place. All you have to do is put the mask on and close your eyes. Research has shown that gently weighted products release natural levels of melatonin-serotonin, which work to promote a peaceful and calming sleep. Each pod is separated by a stitching line to disperse the beads and keep the sleeping mask evenly weighted, giving you the sensation of having heavy, tired eyes. The beads flex and mold to match the contour of any face, guaranteeing your unique and personal comfort. Additionally, the beads are BPA free and machine washable ─ making the nodpod both safe and easy to clean. Each pod of the eye cover is partially and equally weighted to provide gentle weight known as “pressure touch”. Pressure touch has been well documented and proven to be an essential element in providing immediate relaxation and better sleep. Each pod is filled with medical grade polypropylene beads. These beads are BPA free, non-toxic and can be machine-washed and dried.",Health Care,1,Melissa Bamberg,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

For 13 consecutive years, they have earned an A.M. Best rating of A+ (Superior). They currently market insurance products in 45 states and the District of Columbia. The mission of Companion Life Insurance Company is to be a well-managed, customer-focused organization acting in the best interests of its policyholders and marketing partners, operating on a financially sound, growing and diversified basis. Market demand was and continues to be the driving force behind Companion Life's success. From the beginning, they have focused on being responsive to their customers and agents. It is a legacy that began in 1971 and will continue into the future. Companion Life sells True Group (10+ Employees), Trust Group (2 to 9 Employees) and Voluntary products through a network of independent agents and brokers, general agents and managing general underwriters. The products they sell include life, dental, vision, disability and accidental death and dismemberment programs. (Not all products are available in all states.) At Companion Life, they don’t just hear what their customers say — they listen, and they respond. Their dedication to insureds, beneficiaries, employees, business partners and producers is driven by the desire to make a difference.  They know it takes knowledge and skill to use what they gain by listening and turn it into solutions.  And for us it’s more than policy — it’s simply how they do business. Care and compassion underline every customer service phone call, every handshake between agents, every business decision they make and every product they offer. They successfully serve groups as small as two — to groups with hundreds or thousands of employees. The products they offer are “companions” to medical coverage. And because every customer is unique, all their products are available on a stand-alone or voluntary basis. They carry a strong product line because they encourage their customers to tell us about their needs. Because of their strong customer relationships, they know that when a family has quality dental, hearing, vision, disability and/or life coverage, they’re protecting their health, security and future. Preparing for unforeseen illnesses or events with Companion Life coverage can make all the difference in protecting the stability of families and the lives of their members.

Many patients’ lives depend upon complex, expensive medications. Frequently they are forced to receive their medications through mail order and deal with call center waiting queues when they have questions about how to take medications, including self-injections, or possible side effects.  This distance between patients, their medications and their healthcare providers creates an experience that is often confusing and frustrating, which can lead to people missing medications, refills or abandoning treatment regimens altogether.   For the first time, KloudScript’s digital health software platform and industry leading support services enables patients to receive face-to-face specialty care from someone they trust: their community pharmacist. Instead of using up to three pharmacies for care – a local retailer for acute needs like antibiotics, a mail order pharmacy for chronic, non-specialty medications and yet another mail order pharmacy for specialty care – patients can receive care from one pharmacy home. KloudScript has filled a major void in the specialty pharmacy healthcare space. Our network has expanded to nearly every state, and the number of KloudScript pharmacy partners has increased by more than 10 times in the past two years.",Health Care,1,Rinku Patel,51-100,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The first fall was from over 1500′ over McCook Field in Ohio, USA. He used a 28′ Flat Circular canopy in a 4Pin Container.That single ambitious jump brought orders for more chutes, giving his aviation manufacturing company, Irvin Air Chute Company, its beginning. The Irvin parachute gained rapid acceptance, and by the early 1930’s was in service with some 40 air forces around the world. In 1922 Irvin started a club called the “Caterpillar Club”. To become a member, your life must have been saved by a parachute (not a club many try to get into). He selected the name Caterpillar Club in homage to the silk threads that made the original parachutes and the fact that the caterpillar lets itself down to earth by a silken thread. “Life depends on a silken thread,” is the club’s motto.","Manufacturing, Transportation",1,Leslie Leroy Irvin,501-1000,1,M&A,,USD,,,USD,,Cyprium Investment Partners,,1,1,Private,,,,,,

Just months out of college, Bill’s appreciation of good beer and access to his father’s home brewing equipment inspired him to explore the hobby. That same year (1985), Bill gave Ron a home brewing kit as a Christmas gift. With that, both Bill and Ron developed their love of the craft, and a friendly rivalry grew between the two. The good-natured competition pushed Bill and Ron to become accomplished home brewers, and as they both grew disillusioned with their jobs in the corporate world they realized their combined skill and love of brewing could pave the path to successful careers as brewers.",Food and Beverage,2,"Ron Barchet Jr., William J.
