In every commercial construction project, subcontractors submit invoices to the General Contractor (GC). The GC creates their AIA G702 and G703 forms to be signed by an office of the company, the architect on the project, and a notary public. The GC submits this package of potentially hundreds of invoices to the developer in what's known as the ""Application for Payment"", or pay app. The developer adds in their soft costs (marketing, design, architecture, etc.), and submits that package to the lender, or in many cases, a loan service provider. From GC to developer to servicer to lender, every invoice is manually entered every month for every project.  There is no electronic sharing of data up this chain, so the financial analysis of the monthly progress of the project is done manually, which means manual data entry. cd8a removes the time - 2 to 10 hours per draw per month - associated with that manual data entry by applying crowdsourcing to complete the data entry in minutes, as opposed to hours or days it takes an analyst or accountant.  cd8a also securely stores all data electronically, making it a simple task to review past invoices or do discovery in the event of litigation.","Financial Services, Other, Real Estate",1,Kevin Sandlin,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Wide Limited Release Film Distribution Fund,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wide-limited-release-film-distribution-fund,"News, Photography, Video","Salt Lake City, Utah, United States",The Wide Limited Release Film Distribution Fund is seeking capital to scale-up regionally profitable films.,"3,209,615",Western US,,Active,2014-01-14,day,,,,,For Profit,,"The Wide Limited Release Film Distribution Fund is seeking capital to scale-up regionally profitable films to reach a national audience, thus increasing their ROI exponentially. This is not a movie production company (but that is the closest category available among the industry choices Equity Net provides).  This is a fund to leverage the marketing of proven independent films and incorporates deals with the distributors.   Wide Limited Release will choose from  the best films that have already proven their dollar-in/dollar-out investment/profit function regionally and test them for national acceptance.  Those that test well will receive proper and appropriate capital to go national, increasing current profits from hundreds of thousands of dollars to tens of millions of dollars.  We have a slate of successful, profitable films that have only had limited release but shown exceptional ROI in those targeted areas.  The only thing holding them back from wide release and even bigger returns is capital. Wide Limited is looking for accredited investors who share its vision and is capable of providing seed money of $5,000,000.  However, Wide Limited will risk only $300,000  for initial tests before proceeding to the next level.   The funds will be used for advertising buys and earned media exposure to take proven profitable regional film distribution models, test them in other regions of the US, and then scale up to the national market for significant returns if tests prove successful.   Films are released either in a limited release (to a small targeted market) or a wide release (to the nation or world).   Appropriately capitalized, Wide Limited Release  will recoup every marketing dollar spent within six months and earn its profits from the DVD exploitation of such films in the next 18 months after theatrical release.  By duplicating this model repeatedly, it plans to provide its investors a minimum of 30% annual return on their money and a potential of 400%.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment, Video",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

GreenSpace is a hardware/software suite aimed at enterprise organizations looking to gain more insight into their facility utilization.  For example, Company A has facilities around the globe.  They currently send a person with a clipboard up to each floor 3 times a day to try to gauge how often rooms and desks are used, how many people are using the rooms and try to derive utilization rates from that information.  Obviously, this leaves much to be desired.  What about if someone just left the room?  Or, what if they just entered the room after the clipboard carrier just walked past?  How do we know if they used the projector or flat panel display?  They gain no insight into that information.  GreenSpace will allow them to see which rooms are used, when they are used, how many people are in the meeting (in the event 2 people are consistently holding down a 20 person conference room, etc.), and will allow them to shut down a projector or flat panel remotely in the event no one is in the room thereby saving energy and projector lamps.  The big seller is the ability to use the metrics on the back end.  Facility managers now have complete visibility as to how, when and where their space is used.  They can even see if the projectors and flat panels are being used.  There will be no more guessing as to how many meeting rooms are needed and what size they will need to be.  There will also be little debate as to whether or not they need more displays.  Once they have the utilization rates of all of that in front of them they’ll be able to make informed decisions.",Professional Services,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
