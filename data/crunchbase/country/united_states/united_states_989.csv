The Smart Card was successfully funded raising more than $60,000 and is now a part of Indiegogo’s Forever Funding program and still available for contributions.

Denver Energy Exploration,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/denver-energy-exploration,Oil and Gas,"New Braunfels, Texas, United States",An Independent Oil & Gas Operator,"2,154,593",Southern US,,Active,2001-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,,"Traditionally the oil and gas industry marketplace has been dominated by large, international corporations. However, the privately owned Denver Energy Exploration LLC is adding a new type of business to this market. This independent oil and gas operator, with a license from the Railroad Commission of Texas, is founded on the principles of working together with the community and owners of small businesses, with particular focus on reaping profit from the Brookshire Salt Dome oil field. A brief look at the oil and gas industry in general will help provide some background to the activities and goals of Denver Energy Exploration. Oil and gas are responsible for providing 60% of the daily energy needs of the world population of almost 7 billion people. The remaining 40% is provided by coal, hydroelectric and nuclear power, renewable energy and biomass products, e.g. firewood. This is a rough indication of the significance of this market. The world demand for crude oil increased by an average 1.76% per annum between the years 1994 to 2006, and is expected to increase a further 37% by 2030, according to the US Energy Information Administration, to reach a peak of 118 million barrels of oil per day. On the other hand, recent years have seen a slowdown in oil supply growth, creating a situation of record high prices today, with earnings in the industry reaching new heights, more parties becoming involved in the marketplace and activity increasing exponentially. Denver Energy Exploration was founded in 2001 by Michael Christopher, who continues to manage the company today. He is ably assisted by a carefully selected team of professionals and experts in their fields, who complement his own acquired experience and knowledge in the field of oil and gas. The management team includes geologists, engineers and finance professionals. These key people ensure the sustainability and growth of the company in this fiercely competitive market. The company was established with the aim of sharing in the profits and opportunities of the Brookshire Salt Dome project, and this remains its main project. This oil field, covering some 8000 acres, has supplied approximately 10 million barrels of oil to date. Based on production of other salt domes in the area, it is estimated that the potential of the Brookshire Salt Dome is in excess of 100 million barrels, indicating that there is still a lot of oil out there. Denver Energy Exploration LLC deploys the latest and best technologies to develop its leases including Neozoic geophysical and 3D seismic surveys and additional geological data. The company has a number of leases in the Brookshire project in various areas of the site, including the apex area and the north-eastern, southern and eastern flanks. To its credit, Denver Energy Exploration has the highest rating from the Better Business Bureau (BBB) – an A+. Factors contributing to this excellent rating include the company’s length of time of operation, its sterling customer service and solid business ethics. Much of this success can be accredited to manager, Michael Christopher, and under his continuing leadership, the future seems promising for the company.","Energy, Natural Resources",1,Michael Christopher,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Lastly, the technology also enables the most cost effective global (branded) value chains for fresh and fresh cooked, preservative-free entrees and white-table-cloth convenience foods by enabling food-safe, freshest, lowest cost production, transport and merchandising of these high value convenience foods.
