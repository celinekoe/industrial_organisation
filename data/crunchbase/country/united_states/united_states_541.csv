CloudFunded launched its funding platform in response to the following questions: Shouldn't it be easier to invest close to home? What if you could raise capital from your friends and community? What if you could put our money to work, invested in businesses you know and trust? What would it be like if as one of these businesses having your communities and customers invest in your success? At CloudFunded, we believe that the platforms that take shape in response to the new Crowdfunding Act are going to determine the nature of this emerging market, how well it is received, how well it grows, the beneficial impact it has, and the new opportunities it creates. The JOBS Act of 2012, which includes the Crowdfunding Act, allows the general public in the US to openly invest in private equity and securities for the first time in over 80 years. It is about to create a vast new market of investing opportunity, so there are naturally players entering the field who are simply motivated by the business opportunity. This is all well and good, but we must have at least one serious player in the emerging crowdfinancing space that is wholly motivated by the original purpose of the law change – to democratize access to capital, to allow people to put their money to work in main street businesses, in places where they can see the impact of their money at work. We are making good on the promise of the Crowdfunding Act to allow entrepreneurs to fund new businesses with broad public support and give a real financial return to the bold folks who step forward to support them.  CloudFunded lets you connect with and support projects that are making the world a better place. You can find and fund projects in a local area, browse the site, or get alerts from your friends and networks of trust. Projects offer great rewards to their funders. And when the Crowdfunding Act goes into effect, you will be able to fund projects that may even give you your money back and more!",Financial Services,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
