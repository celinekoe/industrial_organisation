Company has developed new paradigms & cutting edge timing signoff methodologies, which have allowed creating new statistical tools that are superior to commercially available STA/SSTA tools. The tools prevent timing violations in critical paths that lead to silicon failure & remove timing pessimism in the rest of paths. Abelite’s unique & truly statistical tools offer:  	- Modeling all conceivable global/local, random/correlated sources of variations including EDA tools/flow/libraries inaccuracies/errors, PVT & geometry variations in cells, wires/vias, Double Patterning Technology (DPT), Aging Degradation (AD), Layout Dependent Effects (LDE) & FinFET  	- Estimating timing yield & power consumption 	- Achieving timing signoff with needed confidence & with taking into account the number of timing critical paths, and  	- Performing optional signoff at all needed PVT/RC/Via/AD/DPT corners Abelite methodology prevents silicon failure while improving design performance, power & area, obtaining best QoR & reduces TAT, Costs & TTM. Methodology & tools were verified on multiple test-cases & designs for several technology nodes.  Business Value: All current designs are at risk of silicon failure due to drawbacks in conventional EDA tools & methodologies that may overlook violations in few paths with “untypical” structures & properties. At the same time, most companies use too many PVT/RC/Via corners & these corners (libraries) are pessimistically characterized for most logical & clock stages. On top, unjustified & often conservative timing derates are used along with OCV/AOCV/POCV/LOCV/SOCV timing derating methods in STA tools, which are not accurate & have multiple drawbacks. It results in risk of silicon failure in few paths & overdesigning & over-margining the majority of paths.  Abelite provides new advanced tools, which are complimentary to current commercial STA/SSTA tools. Abelite will provide best-in-industry consulting in all areas of timing signoff, work with customers to specify their needs, limitations & goals. Customers decide what additional characterization of technology, designs & EDA tools they will do, what data they will share & what services they require. Abelite will provide answers to all customers’ requests including support on conventional timing derating like AOCV/POCV/LOCV. Customers are not required to change their EDA tools (it may be PrimeTime or Encounter Timing Analyzer/Tempus) & design flows. All Abelite tools & methodologies are unique & not available from other EDA vendors. There are no other such services & tools available today.","Design, Hardware, Professional Services, Science and Engineering",1,Alexander Tetelbaum,1-10,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Analysis and Procedures Saluti Cahn uses detailed procedural-level workflows as analysis tools. After an operational procedure has been dissected and analyzed, industry-standard â€œBest Practicesâ€ content, efficiencies, and controls are implemented.  Then, Saluti Cahn can produce hyperlinked Word document procedures as an end product.  These updated, documented procedures are then used for staff re-training and reference.  Advantages of Using Saluti Cahn Saluti Cahn strategically limits the number of projects accepted, enabling the principals, Dr. Dean Saluti and Marjorie Cahn, to be at the Client sites working with their staff at all times.  Dr. Saluti personally conducts procedural-level workflow analysis.  Marjorie Cahn personally reviews, tests, and edits completed Word document procedures.  This ensures superior-quality output.  Also, FTE cost savings realized from Saluti Cahn efficiencies provides immediate ROI.  Saluti Cahnâ€™s reasonable billing for an entire project is, in most cases, completely paid from ROI realized within the first month of project assignment.
