In this way, â€œnormalâ€ people (IE, folks like you and me who might like and even love photography but who are not really professional photographers) are given the possibility to generate a true income.  Taking all of the above into account, it could be said that the site democratizes the way in which art is approached and consumed. The site certainly levels the playing field and lets those who might have a fine eye for photography but who lack the contacts to start making a name for themselves compete with those who are connected.

When people choose John Prior and The Prior Law Firm, it is due to several very important reasons. Experience and Background. The Prior Law Firm, P.C. has been helping people in and around Bloomington to fight for their rights since 2004. Over the lifetime of the firm, Mr. Prior has successfully defended countless people charged throughout Illinois. However, his experience in criminal law started long before 2004. For years, he worked as an Appellate Prosecutor, Assistant State’s Attorney, and even served as the elected State’s Attorney for Henderson County. In other words, his job was to build cases against alleged offenders and try to secure convictions. Why should this matter to you? Because it means that he understands how the minds of prosecutors work. He now uses the countless hours he spent crafting legal strategies to put people behind bars to more easily anticipate and poke holes in those strategies when defending his clients. Recognition and Results. Over his years of defending people just like you, Mr. Prior has been recognized in a number of ways, including being named a Top 100 Trial Lawyer by The National Trial Lawyers and listed as one of the 10 Best in client satisfaction from the American Institute of Criminal Law Attorneys two years in a row. Dedication and Respect. When you find yourself facing criminal charges, it can negatively impact the rest of your life. Because of this, fighting those charges should be your number one priority. John Prior has a clear understanding of the stakes involved and will use every legal avenue available to him to make sure your rights are respected as he works to get your charges reduced, dropped, or dismissed. Moreover, he knows how confusing and depersonalizing the criminal legal process can be for defendants, so he strives to help his clients understand their situation and keep them informed about what to expect every step of the way.",Professional Services,1,John Prior,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Rheti Inc,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rheti-inc,"Android, Apps, DIY, Mobile, Software","Durham, North Carolina, United States",Rheti is Wordpress meets IFTTT meets App Inventor,"1,983,767","Research Triangle, East Coast, Southern US",,Active,2012-03-09,day,,,,,For Profit,http://www.rheti.com,"Rheti believes that anyone can build a great mobile application. We make this possible by transforming today’s complex app development processes into an enjoyable, simple to use, and highly customizable experience. If you’re the kind of person who has ever had an app idea (for your life or job), or wished a particular app worked differently, then Rheti’s platform enables you to build that app, using just your smart phone. Our revolutionary technology requires no programming experience, creates 100% native Android apps, allows for customization in both behavior and look-and-feel, leverages a growing marketplace of Android and third party features (Google, Facebook, WeMo, etc), easily connects with data feeds, and is free to use. Think of Rheti as Wordpress meets IFTTT meets App Inventor.  Customer Problem: There is an incredible disconnect between an app idea (or need) and the ability for anyone to execute on that idea. This problem has different implications in the corporate and consumer worlds. In the enterprise world, management has to navigate through an IT backlog in order to build an app that could drastically increase their efficiency and bottom lines. This process can cost companies upwards of hundreds of thousands of dollars in time and money (sometimes more than $2MM), in addition to foregone revenue or productivity from the customized app. In the consumer world, the disconnect between the app creator and the end user could result in subpar apps, privacy concerns, and lack of creativity in the entire ecosystem. A developer will likely sacrifice an app’s functionality unless it addresses a greater market, even though that unique functionality could be extremely creative and useful to a small group of users. Consequently, apps will never be able to be individually tailored to a person’s unique needs. This is affecting app creativity with the end result being an ecosystem full of app iterations rather than app innovations. A developer might also have to sell a user’s private information with other companies in order to generate revenue. This creates mistrust between consumer and developer and further widens the gap between both groups.  Solution: Remove all barriers in mobile application building and enable anyone to build great applications. In doing so, we can spark a more efficient and creative mobile ecosystem for enterprises, developers, and non-developers. Rheti is an Android application that allows users to build apps on their devices using touch commands. Rheti requires no programming experience, creates 100% native Android apps, allows for customization in both behavior and look-and-feel, leverages a growing marketplace of Android and third party features (Google, Facebook, WeMo, etc), easily connects with data feeds, and is free to use. All parties benefit: 1) Enterprise management, sales, and marketing teams are capable of building beautiful internal or consumer facing apps (with the power to tie into middleware systems) without going through the IT backlog. This ability can lead to increases in productivity, efficiency, and even greater sales. 2) Developers can focus on creating and selling innovative features in the Rheti marketplace. The platform also shortens their own app development time, as there is no need for API integration, time-consuming front-end work, or even debugging of Rheti marketplace features. 3) Non-developers are able to make apps with a degree of customization and functionality much greater than previously available.","Apps, Consumer Goods, Mobile, Platforms, Software",2,"Juan Porras, Ralph Tavarez",1-10,3,Seed,154000,USD,154000,154000,USD,154000,Family and Friends Investment,,1,,Private,,,,,,
