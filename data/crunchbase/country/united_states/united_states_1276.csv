In addition, the CreateDebate platform includes a host of social networking features that allow students to build their own profile and make connections with their classmates. Teachers love CreateDebate in the Classroom because it's simple to configure and administer. It typically takes about 15 minutes to create and personalize a new debate community. The admin panel guides the teacher through set up and offers access to a wide array of features that make teaching easier. Teachers can make announcements, see who is online, track and evaluate participation, give private feedback, filter inappropriate content and more!
