Using natural fabrics, like lamb, leather and python, EN NOIR’s line of outwear, tops, T-shirts and sweatpants turn practical, and season-less clothing into high-end street wear.  Founder and Head Designer of EN NOIR, Robert Garcia, has been in the fashion industry since 2008. He cut his teeth at the West Coast street wear label Black Scale, was schooled in the legendary Parsons The New School of Design (Tim Gunn of Project Runway) and Otis Parsons. He launched EN NOIR (the French word for “in black”) in 2012.  From its headquarters in Los Angeles, CA, EN NOIR clearly has defined a market for the latest range in exotic natural materials, like bamboo, lamb skin leather and python, to turn the ordinary street wear into the extraordinary.  EN NOIR has established strong following with key celebrities such as Kanye West (who has his own men’s and women’s clothing line), Beyonce (who co-owns the women’s line Dereon), and Kim Kardashian, which have put EN NOIR in the spotlight. Rapper CurT@!n$ emerged as a trendsetter as soon as Kanye West called him a """"fashion genius"""" in Complex's 2007 April/May issue. EN NOIR has a co-signed piece by CurT@!n$.  This number of athletes, singers, rappers and personalities wearing EN NOIR or have expressed an interest in the apparel line, include A-listers and fashion icons Rihanna and Jay-Z (who also owns his own fashion line Rocawear). It is not uncommon for celebrities to wear each other’s fashion. The buzz and the ability to stand out in the crowd is what makes fashion successful among pop star, urban artists and those who wish to emulate them – the fans.  The Company is in a number of retail stores including Barney’s of New York, who has agreed to roll-out the EN NOIR merchandise to all its stores globally.","Clothing and Apparel, Commerce and Shopping, Design",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

We can close quickly, and you can have the peace of mind that your house is sold, and you don’t even have to be out of the house as soon as we close. We usually pay all of the closing costs, which are several thousand dollars in New York State, so you wouldn’t have to come to closing with a nickel. We often are able to pay full price for your home, and we close everything with an attorney when your ready. We will take your house as-is which means no home inspector is going to come pick your house apart, which can be costly. Most importantly, you’ll find when you sell to us – you’ll net more money than any other way you can sell, because there is no commission and we usually pay all of the closing costs.
