It is during this pivotal point that children transition from learning how to read, into readers who learn from what they have read. Children who are not reading at grade level in the third grade are at risk of falling behind in their school work, which puts them at risk of not graduating from high school. In fact, it is such an indicator of a child’s future success that some states base their prison capacity off of third-grade reading scores. United Way is partnering with schools to help at-risk readers meet this important benchmark. They have convened a coalition to identify gaps in services that are preventing children’s success with reading. Together, the coalition is finding ways to bridge those gaps and keep our community’s children on target for success in school and life.","Health Care, Other, Social Impact",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
