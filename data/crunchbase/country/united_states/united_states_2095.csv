This should be a time every teenager looks forward to without any worry of violence or crime because they are being attentively protected for the case of extreme danger. Right now, that isn’t entirely true.” - Sean Levinson, Elite Daily, April 11, 2013 Never-Before-Offered, In-The-Moment, Mobile Conflict Resolution & Mediation Caroami is an online conflict resolution and mediation platform operated through a messaging interface. It uses Crowdsourcing, AI, and Machine Learning to resolve conflicts in-the-moment, before they escalate, such as roommate disputes, dating issues, ghosted friendships, unfriended pals, gender politics, and sexual harassment. The millennial market looks for an instant, mobile, and electronic solution to conflict.  $2.9B Market Opportunity Higher education institutions are in turmoil, and Caroami is ready to step in to help at this pivotal time with our unique offering. The college experience has always been demanding, and students face a range of interpersonal problems that determine their success or failure. Add to that the effect mobile and social technology has had on the social skills of students entering college in recent years leaving them without adequate negotiating or communication skills to resolve disputes. Even though 98% of the 83.1M Millenials in the US use a smartphone, there is no digital tool on the market that provides an instant, mobile, or confidential way to help them resolve interpersonal conflict. Traditional, off-line mediation solutions are time-intensive, cumbersome, and extremely costly. In addition to higher education, Caroami is poised to serve corporate users, HOAs, courts, government, and the military with a market potential of $2.9B and growing. The future of conflict resolution is digital, instantaneous, and mobile, and is currently not being adequately served. Workplace discrimination against employees based on race, gender, or sexual orientation costs businesses an estimated $64 billion annually, not including the cost to their reputation or workplace morale. When companies buy harassment insurance, they are not protecting the victims. Caroami protects both the end user and the organization. Value Proposition From frazzled to happy, students can now use Caroami to resolve their roommate disputes, gender politics, sexual harassment, and other issues at the moment with our messaging interface-based mobile which replaces the slow, inadequate, and rather public Facebook and Twitter apps they are currently using for this purpose. Colleges, universities, and other organizations can avoid costly settlements, expensive lawyers, and hits to their reputations with the help of our app that affordably uses Crowdsourcing, AI, and ML to guide students to de-escalate potential violence and restore relationships that have gone awry. It also has applications in cases of gender, religion, and identity politics that pose legal, PR nightmares, and attrition, all while keeping problems internal to the organization.  Happy students turn into happy alumni and future donors. Paying clients will receive data/analytics to better plan next academic year. Employers can identify and prevent problems way before they escalate. Students will learn to resolve conflicts over time, promote wellness, and preserve friendships.
