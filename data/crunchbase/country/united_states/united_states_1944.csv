AchieveIt is the solution organizations use to get their biggest, most important initiatives out of the boardroom and into reality.  We look at ideas and say – Let’s actually do this.™  It all started in 2010, when we were doing strategy consulting for hospitals. Back then we were primarily consultants, with a limited leave-behind software to help track and monitor the plan we had built together.  But over and over, we noticed our clients’ strategic plans were being supported by a bunch of different kinds of plans, with each individual team using their own methods to track and report. What our clients really needed was a way to manage across these integrated plans at the same time, and to be able to see all supporting goals and activities from all their plans, in one view.  So, we supercharged our software and services to help them get everything in view, get everyone engaged, and get every possible advantage. What resulted was an entirely new approach to organizational execution: Integrated Plan Management.  Today, all kinds of organizations turn to AchieveIt for Integrated Plan Management – everyone from utility companies working on new forms of energy, to government agencies looking to reduce taxpayer expenses, to Fortune 500s trying to launch new growth initiatives.  With the growth they’ve accomplished with the help of AchieveIt’s platform and services, these organizations are able to spend 90% of their time actually getting things done – instead of 90% of their time reporting.","Administrative Services, Data and Analytics, Other, Software",1,Scott Regan,11-50,7,Early Stage Venture,12500000,USD,12500000,12500000,USD,12500000,"Tech Square Ventures, BIP Capital",1,2,,Private,,,,,,

Curb connects you to safe, reliable rides from the professional taxi and for-hire drivers nationwide. By bringing technology to the taxi and sedan experience, Curb is offering riders choice, reliability, and convenience whenever they ride.  Curb’s story is told in three parts. Curb began in 2007 as RideCharge, an online service for business travelers to manage the booking and expensing of taxi rides and other local ground transportation. It soon developed a broader consumer focus, hastened by the adoption of smartphone technology. In our second iteration, Curb was Taxi Magic, the first mobile app for ordering a ride, on-demand. After Apple introduced the App Store as a distribution platform for consumer apps, we built Taxi Magic upon our existing technology and released it in January 2009. Over the next five years, we built a nationwide network of riders, drivers, and taxi companies. In that time, our technology-powered millions of rides and highlighted the challenges facing everyday travelers. In August 2014, Taxi Magic became a Curb to deliver an improved ride experience and consumer choice to ground travelers everywhere. All rides begin and end at the curb, and our technology improves the entire experience from curb to curb by eradicating underlying pain points and making ground travel seamless and hassle-free.  Now, Curb is consistently ranked in the Top 50 for “Travel & Tourism” in the App Store and the Android Marketplace. In addition, we have built the Curb Passenger Information Monitor (PIM) that supports credit card payment and entertaining video content. The Curb Network consists of 35,000 taxis with 90 fleets in 60 US cities. By aligning riders, drivers, and fleets, Curb offers a better overall ride experience.
