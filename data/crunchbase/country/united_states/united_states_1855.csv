OBC has developed a minimally sized commercial scale facility which would still have economic viability by selecting a 10 MMGPY capacity facility that would require only 3.2% of the theoretical maximum feedstock available.  Feedstock requirements combined with feedstock flexibility inherent in the technology provides OBC with a considerable reduction in feedstock acquisition risk. OBC’s economic modeling is done on an open market price basis and has been done at both current and five year low market prices.    OBC is profitable at 5 year low market prices with a projected Net Income of $29 million and a Gross Margin of $67 million.
