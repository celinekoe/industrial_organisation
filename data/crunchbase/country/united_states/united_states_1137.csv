It can happen in a matter of seconds and can cost thousands of dollars to repair. Dallas, TX is no stranger to water damage, with its weather patterns and infrastructure making it particularly susceptible to a variety of water-related issues. For starters, many of the pipelines in Dallas aren’t well suited for freezing cold weather, which seems to happen more often in recent winters. This has led to numerous cases of busted pipes and severe water damage as a result. Homeowners are often caught off guard by this, as they may not have experienced such extreme weather patterns in the past. When it’s not freezing, it’s raining. Dallas is a particularly wet city, with frequent rain showers that can cause water damage in a variety of ways. The air tends to hold onto moisture, causing the ground to become saturated and shifting in the process. This shifting can damage many pipes and sewer lines, which tend to happen under homes, resulting in very severe water damage if not detected on time (and they usually aren’t). Heavy rainfall doesn’t only contribute to busted pipes – it can also directly cause a flash flood or a sewage backup. When there’s tons of excess water, river creeks can easily get overloaded and rise, causing devastating floods usually without any warning. Flash floods are one of the most destructive antagonists in Dallas, often causing extensive damage to homes and property. If you’ve experienced any type of water damage, you’re not alone. Big D Water Damage Restoration is here to help. We understand that life in Dallas can be tough at times, and water damage is no exception. That’s why we offer professional restoration services to help you get back on your feet as quickly as possible. Our team of highly trained restoration technicians are equipped with the latest tools and technology to help identify and mitigate any water damage that may have occurred. We offer a comprehensive range of services, including water extraction, drying and dehumidification, mold remediation, and reconstruction.

It is a “Jigsaw-like” business model data/sales intelligence platform to be launched by SalesQuest LLC. Content to the platform will ultimately be provided by an “army” of sales people who will give up their “account knowledge”(sales LEADS) in exchange for “account knowledge”(sales LEADS) they need for FREE (i.e. “points”). These opportunities (called BattleCards™) can be traded or purchased by individuals or companies. Marketing and Sales organizations will subscribe to this platform for marketing, sales and CRM purposes. This concept capitalizes on the 10B+ market for sales intelligence. Company Background and Game Plan:  The founders of CRUSH army currently have a successful sales intelligence company, Seligence LLC dba SalesQuest. This product launch will be a natural next company growth opportunity to use their current CRUSH data to quickly get the CRUSH army going.  This current content, which is now a $2M business with customers like EMC, Accenture, CA and Dell, grew out of the need for better/more sales intelligence. Based on an extremely strong demand from this current customer base for this increased intelligence, they have started to develop/seed the CRUSH army platform using technology they developed to provide sales reps with “free” contacts.  Four weeks into the launch, they have 1000+ users of the CRUSH army platform (V1.0).  They are currently developing the “BattleCards™”(V2.0) that will be traded for points or purchased. BattleCards™ include details of a “lead” including the company, opportunity description, timeframe, dollar value and decision-makers. Management:   Mimi Evans, Co-Founder and CEO is currently Co-Founder and CEO of Salesquest.com has successfully grown the company over 25 – 35% per year for the past 8 years providing high tech companies like EMC, CA and Cognizant with CRUSH Reports and CRUSH Alerts data for sales, marketing and sales operations. She has previously been a leader at IBM, Netscape, Lotus and start-up organizations throughout her career. Ryan Murray, Co-Founder and CSO runs the sales, marketing and technology organization that has made SalesQuest so successful since its inception in 2003.  SalesQuest has grown organically, is extremely profitable, currently has no debt and has a 100% receivables record.
