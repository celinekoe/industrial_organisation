I attended my very first World Tea Expo in 2002, and I still go each year to satisfy tea growers from all over the world, take classes in blending, keep up-to-date on tea's health benefits, and --- primarily-- taste numerous teas. In 2006, when one door closed (alas, Kindred Spirit could withstand no more typhoons), another door opened and I found myself transferring to Santa Fe, New Mexico. Prior to I was even settled, I got requests from former clients who wanted to purchase the tea they 'd grown to enjoy at Kindred Spirit, so I launched ArtfulTea in 2007 as an online business. Since then, ArtfulTea has grown to include a retail store situated simply 2 blocks from the Historic Santa Fe Plaza. If you're ever in ""the City Different"" please come see us at 117 Galisteo Street. And make certain to introduce yourself when you visit!
