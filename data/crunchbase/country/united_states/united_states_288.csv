Six months later, it became one of the original 13 states that founded the United States of America, and in June 1788 it was the 9th state to ratify the United States Constitution, bringing that document into effect. Concord is the state capital, while Manchester is the largest city in the state. It has no general sales tax, nor is personal income other than interest and dividends taxed at either the state or local level. It is known for the New Hampshire primary, the first primary in the U.S. presidential election cycle. With some of the largest ski mountains on the East Coast, New Hampshire’s major recreational attractions include skiing, snowmobiling, and other winter sports; hiking and mountaineering; observing the fall foliage; summer cottages along many lakes and the seacoast; motorsports at the New Hampshire Motor Speedway; and Motorcycle Week, a popular motorcycle rally held in Weirs Beach near Laconia in June.","Government and Military, Other, Professional Services",2,"John Mason, John Wheelwright",10001+,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
