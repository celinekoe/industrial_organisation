She could find little to wear that expressed her creativity – clothes that said “I am me!”, that she felt comfortable in, that were fun, wearable, & easy to care for. Her parents’ washing machine was taken over for Jennifer’s dyeing whims, and her garage at home  became a maze of drying t-shirts on clotheslines in every color of the rainbow. From the very start, the word ‘blue’ and the icon of a fish paired themselves together in a playful, natural way to create something that meant more than a color name. The word ‘blue’ was not always printed in its obvious color selection, and as time passed, Jennifer no longer saw it as a color word but simply as a word free of boundaries… topsy turvy and free to be anything she wanted it to be. The marriage of unusual shapes and colors began, and Blue Fish became a lasting icon for clothing without rules.     COMPLETELY DARE TO BE BEAUTIFUL. EVERYWHERE, WONDER. Her outside the box thinking with colors and patterns became the defining aspect of Jennifer’s clothing, almost from the start. With dreamlike prints and limitless color, there was nothing else like Blue Fish to be found in the world. Visiting craft fairs and music festivals on the east coast, the colorful, creative clothing quickly became regionally known. But it wasn’t until friends encouraged Jennifer to attempt the famed New York Pret in 1986, a major trade show, that Blue Fish exploded onto the scene. Jennifer received ten times the amount of orders she expected from the show – Blue Fish was the talk of the event, and by far the most popular booth. A heartfelt connection of souls united over clothing they had longed for – a way to be bold and be different.   IMAGINATIVE POWER, MAGICAL MINDS, INFINITE PATIENCE Thrown into the world of production, Jennifer quickly wrangled textile suppliers, sewers, printers and artisans alike to help her pull together the overwhelming order and began to create the Blue Fish family. Friends helped friends, and the candle was burned at both ends as Jennifer and her small team slept on the floor of their newly-purchased Frenchtown, NJ location in an effort to meet their deadline. The work was always about fun, and the heart of Blue Fish was coaxed to life by many caring hands. After the success of the New York show, Blue Fish grew by unimaginable leaps and bounds. The heart and soul of Blue Fish’s free thinking appealed to more and more women like you, as they learned about the clothing.   BLUE FISH NOW... All of the heart that built the Blue Fish history is still true today, and Jennifer has helped keep the ideals and beliefs true after so many years. Fairfield, Iowa artisans hand-print each piece of clothing on location, weaving their personal touches in the paint and stamp-carving to create a completely one-of-a-kind item for each collection. Since each piece of clothing is completely unique, just like our customers, Blue Fish lovers are always encouraged to come and play dress up in our stores. United by the spirit of individuality, Blue Fish lovers meet to trade their Blue Fish items among one another, fostering the collectible and uniquely community-based feeling of the clothing and making our family grow in ever-widening circles. While Blue Fish has come a long way from Jennifer’s dorm room, it will always hold the values of the beginning true: the importance of creativity, the closeness of family and friends, and the brilliance of wearing your heart – and your art – on your sleeve. Let our clothes be the reflection of your spirit every day!","Clothing and Apparel, Commerce and Shopping, Community and Lifestyle, Design",1,Jennifer Barclay,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

However, web3 is quickly gaining popularity and has the potential to revolutionize how we eat out. In the current landscape, restaurant owners create and market their NFT using **Opensea**, and then users have to find their NFT and create a wallet to collect these NFTs, which have no direct benefits. This is a problem, as we are currently seeing users lose interest in NFTs because they do not understand their value or how to use them effectively. [According to Square](https://squareup.com/us/en/townsquare/restaurant-trends#:~:text=%236.-,Restaurants%20are%20rethinking%20experiences%20to%20build%20deep%20customer%20loyalty,-Restaurants%20are%20coming), **Restaurants are rethinking experiences to build deep customer loyalty and drive sales. This is especially important for restaurants trying to create a differentiated experience in their category, which is the majority of restaurants today. The goal is to create an experience that makes customers feel like they are part of something special and exclusive.  NFTs can provide this experience by giving customers access to experiences they can’t get anywhere else.** [**Starbucks recently announced that they are adopting web3 as a reward system**](https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/starbucks-is-about-to-make-a-controversial-change-to-its-rewards-program-some-customers-are-going-to-love-it.html). This means that many non-crypto natives will be able to experiment with crypto assets without missing out on the most critical aspect of blockchain; decentralization and trustless systems. In addition, by providing users with the ability to use their NFTs as utilities, Starbucks would be able to generate more customer loyalty and engagement. This integration will also allow Starbucks to expand its reach into different markets where it previously had no presence. This will be the beginning of insight and metadata that NFTs will offer as a social currency to businesses. We believe that whoever aggregates and provides a seamless user experience will move the space forward like it needs.","Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Internet Services, Sales and Marketing, Software",2,"Valentine Osakwe, Zerryn Gines",1-10,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,"Techstars, Zecca Lehn",1,2,,Private,,,,,,
