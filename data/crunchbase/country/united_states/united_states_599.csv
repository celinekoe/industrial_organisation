They use a straightforward approach based on the well-known principle of vaccination – vaccinate with what you want to develop protection against. The significant possibilities of such vaccines have been described, but none have yet passed the clinical trial stage. Antigenic essence technology is the revitalization of cellular vaccination, as antigenic essence exhibits all the identifying properties of cancer cells while also allowing for control of composition, purification from ballast substances (cellular 'noise'), and evasion of MHC restrictions. Therefore, antigenic essence technology allows upgrading of already discovered cellular compositions, as well as creation new ones. Our antigenic essence technology platform is behind the development of the potential candidates for cancer vaccine, under the brand name SANTAVAC, that can be tuned against virtually any solid cancer.
