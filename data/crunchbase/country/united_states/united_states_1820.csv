It didn't start out as Laxco, but rather a venture between two unlikely partners. Back in the early 90's two gentlemen by the names of Eric Chen and Steve Lytle formed a partnership that changed the face of 2 completely different industries. As young entrepreneurs, Steve and Eric saw a need for higher quality of imported Chinese manufactured products. The idea was simple, Steve would form a company in the US and handle setting up the distribution channels, while Eric would set up a factory in China and handle the supply chain.  Their focus was on quality, and all products shipped to the US would go through a quality control inspection, labeling, and packaging, prior to shipping out to customers or to distributors. This insured that product with the Westover Scientific label, meant that it meet higher quality standards than products simply shipped into the US and put directly onto shelf's for customers to purchase. As the companies grew, so did their ambition, and quickly they realized that ""why simply just import, why not develop our own products"", and so began a legacy that has lead to two successful startups in the Telecommunication and Life Science industries.     Westover Scientific was the first venture in which they started out developing and imported refractometers, microscopes, and fiber optic light sources. However in the late 90's an opportunity presented it self and first handheld fiber microscope was born. It was a simple design, that fit into the palm of your hand and allowed the technician to visually inspect the end of fiber optic cables prior to mating them. This ensured the end face of the fiber was free of dust, scratches or any other imperfections that might inhibit the laser from passing between connectors. Their concept and design quickly took off, and development of video based microscopes was soon introduced. By early 2000 Westover had grown to become a market leader in microscopes for the telecommunication industry and was soon purchased by a large Telecom giant.

Originally inspired by [Friendster](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/friendster), MySpace quickly grew to become the world's largest social network, before being overtaken by [Facebook](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/facebook). User pages are highly customizable and support integration with widgets such as [Slide](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/slide) or [YouTube](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/youtube). MySpace provides users with a way to connect around content and culture.  MySpace was started as a side project of the internet marketing company eUniverse (now called [Intermix Media](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/intermixmedia)) in August 2003. [Brad Greenspan](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/brad-greenspan), then founder and CEO of eUniverse oversaw the project, which was also led by [Chris DeWolfe](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/chris-dewolfe) (later CEO), [Josh Berman](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/josh-berman), and [Tom Anderson](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/tom-anderson) (soon to be President). It officially launched in January 2004. By February 2004, MySpace reached 1 million registered users. By November 2004, that number had reached 5 million. In July, 2005 [News Corporation](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/newscorporation) bought eUniverse (renaming it [Intermix Media](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/intermixmedia)) for $580 M, of which approximately $327 M was the valuation of MySpace. At this time, the site had 20 million registered users. In mid 2007, [News Corporation](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/newscorporation) contemplated selling 25% of MySpace stock to [Yahoo!](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/yahoo) in a deal that would have valued the site at $12 B, though this never went through.  After being acquired, MySpace's revenues grew rapidly, as [News Corporation](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/newscorporation) pursued lucrative advertising deals. In August 2006, [Google](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/google) made a $900 M agreement to provide search and advertising directly on the MySpace site, which is set to expire in June 2010. In mid 2008, MySpace participated in a major site redesign. Throughout its history, critics have often cited the chaotic and disorganized interface as a severe drawback to usability of the site. This redesign made the main page more streamlined and clean. In late 2006, [Universal Music Group](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/universal-music-group) sued MySpace for millions in damages from copyright infringement. This suit was settled in mid 2008 by the launch of [MySpace Music](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/myspace-music), a site where users can listen to streaming songs from all sorts of artists. To supplement this venture, MySpace acquired [iLike](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ilike) in mid 2009. MySpace had previously also launched a record label in 2005 and musicians such as Lily Allen and Sean Kingston were first discovered through MySpace. In mid 2007, MySpace acquired [PhotoBucket](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/photobucket) for $250 M in cash, plus an additional $50 M earn-out. By late 2009, [News Corporation](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/newscorporation) sold a 2/3 stake in [Photobucket](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/photobucket) to a group of investors valuing the company at $60 M, over 80% less than the acquisition price. Since 2008, user growth has stagnated and page views and other metrics have fallen. In April 2009, longtime CEO and co-founder [Chris DeWolfe](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/chris-dewolfe) was replaced by [Owen Van Natta](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/owen-van-natta), in a publicized firing. President and head of product, [Tom Anderson](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/tom-anderson), was kept on, but in a different position. Two months following this, MySpace announced it was laying off 30% of its workforce amounting to 420 people. In June 2011, Myspace was acquired by Specific Media for a [reported US$35 million](http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/29/myspace-goes-to-specific-media-for-35m-ceo-is-out-press-release/). Justin Timberlake also took ownership in this acquisition and will play a strong role in Myspace's future strategy and creative direction.","Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio",7,"Aber Whitcomb, Brad Greenspan, Chris DeWolfe, Colin Digiaro, Josh Berman, Michael Addicott, Tom Anderson",251-500,1,M&A,37790000,USD,37790000,37790000,USD,37790000,"Redpoint, Intermix Media",1,2,4,Private,,,,,,
