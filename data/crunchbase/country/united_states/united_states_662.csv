Having successfully created several software platforms and technology products, they have been looking at ways to increase their efficiency, improve their sales and bring order into their new business development efforts. They had a ton of requests from vendors who wanted to market their product or at least refer us to their customers and earn commission for their efforts. Pretty simple stuff, but they simply did not have the tools to accommodate this. Download their free brochure. So they went out researched, called companies and sat through demos (heck they even had to pay for a few third rate system -- just to talk to sales). After analyzing what they had encountered, they realized that the PRM programs that were being offered lacked simplicity, were overpriced and terribly executed their basic requirements.

Many services. Many devices. Zypr aggregates proprietary 3rd-party APIs, categorizes their functions and then presents those functions through a single, normalized API with full voice control on a wide range of platforms, including mobile, desktop, consumer electronics devices and auto infotainment.  By aggregating and normalizing 3rd party APIs, Zypr creates a stable access point for devices and apps to access those services without concern for service and API changes. Zypr’s voice client adapter entity provides voice control over all services regardless of provider or category. As such, Zypr enables a powerful natural language voice control metaphor for accessing a wide variety of service types. For example, instead of speaking to a single POI vendor like Yelp, a client can speak to the Zypr POI client adapter entity and have a single point of access to all the POI services integrated through Zypr. As services change or get swapped out, the client can continue to use POI services without any code changes. Also, by creating a single sign-on for the user, Zypr enables a unified service profile for the user across multiple devices. In addition, by creating a meta-level of access by service category, Zypr creates a unique ability for compelling mash-ups across services. For example, instead of mashing up “Twitter” with “Tuner2”, a Zypr client can integrate Social Networking and Internet Radio generically such that no matter what services are selected by the end user, the two services are integrated through Zypr. This effect is both a benefit to the end user and a dramatic simplification for the developer.","Apps, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio, Software",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
