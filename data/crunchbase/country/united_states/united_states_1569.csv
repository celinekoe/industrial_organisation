In search of a better way to feed crops, Actagro® looked to the foremost authority—Nature. The success of Actagro Organic Acids® comes from working with and imitating nature in both form and source. The resulting technology enables Actagro® to manufacture plant nutrients reacted with stable humus components that are extremely efficient, highly plant responsive, and friendly to the environment. The high efficiency of products backed by the Actagro Organic Acids® Technology Platform™ make them ideal for growers interested in maintaining sustainable agriculture practices which promote less material applied with same or greater yield results. Actagro® manufactures unique products. The process begins with the extraction of leonardite (a natural product rich in organic matter) and continues with controlled reactions with nutrients and the organic acids extracted from leonardite. Proprietary carbohydrate packages are integrated to this unique, complex manufacturing process to result in a four part system which includes unique humin fragment and our carbohydrate packages in addition to humic and fulvic acids. Actagro® products are proven by both hands-on field experience and third party, replicated research work. The key to their efficiency is the unique formulation of Actagro Organic Acids®. When properly applied, Actagro® products have repeatedly increased yields, improved quality and provided the greatest return on investment. Actagro Organic Acids® are not petroleum based and are manufactured with a low energy input process which makes them have a considerately lower carbon footprint relative to synthetic fertilizers.

In those days, it was a humble butter and eggs shop that had a lot of block cheeses and catered to the little Italian enclave that Bleecker Street was at the time. Rob Kaufelt bought the Murray’s in the early 90s and began traveling the globe, finding new cheeses that no one had ever heard of and bringing them back to the US.

And everywhere in between.

Board members have been an essential part of VEA’s continued growth and community contributions.

Over time, with growing demand for work lifts and platforms, Genie expanded operations and established itself in new markets. Since then, products such as man-lifts, stick booms, articulated booms, light towers, and telehandlers have been added to the Genie® product line.   By the early 2000s, due to the economic downturn, the company decided to seek a partner that held the same values. Terex Corporation, with a history of acquiring equipment manufacturers worldwide proved a good match for the business.  In 2002, Genie Industries was sold and became a part of Terex.   During the years following the sale, due to its strength and reputation in the marketplace, it was determined to maintain the Genie® brand within the Terex Aerial Work Platforms (AWP) segment of Terex.
