The understanding and shared approach to binary options trading is what connects all of the members of this trading community. We believe that as a group we will have a much greater impact on the binary options market and our personal trading accounts. Almost all of the readers in this community have gone it alone for many months or years before deciding to be part of this collective unit. The main principle shared by the members of the binary today group is to grow steadily without risking too much capital. We believe that traders should focus on keeping a reasonable money management strategy in order to keep the risk low. Too frequently in the binary options market, traders are tempted into high risk trading strategies, get rich quick schemes and automated systems promoted by marketers, not traders. We do our best to guide our members in the direction of real traders and helpful community members to ensure that they don't get caught up in the darker side of the binary options marketplace. The content we aggregate as well as write in this community include income reports, podcasts, videos, product reviews, education and actionable trading strategies. The podcast through 8 episodes is slowly teaching traders about the binary options market and what type of trading approach they should take based on their own personal preferences. We never want to force the members of this community into making decisions, rather help them find what's most suitable for their trading strategy. Many of the community members prefer short term expiry trades like 5 minute trades and 15 minute trades while others prefer 30 minute trades, 1 hour trades, 4 hour trades and even daily options trades. This makes the group often difficult to manage but it allows for numerous voices to share their messages and opinions on different trading styles. Many of the members that join Binary Today aren't sure what type of trader they are until they read through the thousands of comments to figure out the secret that is inside each and every one of us. Who we are as a trader is connected directly to parts of our character that we aren't even aware of, in this community helps traders tap into that potential and understand exactly the type of trader they need to be in order to be successful. Whether a trader prefers manual trading strategies or trading signals, there is always a place for them in the Binary Today community. We also play a very large role in the investigation and evaluation of binary options brokers. One of the  largest issues in the binary options market is the lack of regulation and the amount of brokers that are treating this like a wild West. We do everything in our power to ensure that the members of this community are aware of which brokers are reliable and which need to be avoided at all costs. As we make our way through this binary options journey, there is only one thing that we are truly sure of. We aren't going to get to our destination without the help of others.",Other,,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

When these """"invisible"""" arrays are applied to the skin, they pierce the stratum cornuem and temporarily open pores to allow transportation of nutrients into the deeper layers of the skin. Since SPE stays in the epidermal layer without reaching the dermis, where the nerves reside, it does not cause any pain, bleeding, or discomfort. As a result, it is safe, painless, and effective. Clinical studies have shown that SPE can deliver active ingredients to 60-70 micrometers below the skin barrier. A key benefit of SPE is the increased absorption of active ingredients at the right location within the skin to maximize the effects of these active ingredients, as well as helping to produce Collagen and Elastin to promote healing and skin beautification.","Biotechnology, Science and Engineering",1,Bai Xu,1-10,2,,,USD,,,USD,,SAIF Partners,,1,,Private,,,,,,

It is being developed by Globcal International (see profile) which permits crowdfunded equity and public ownership stakes of remote community based cooperative business assets, capital and real estate through sustainable investments in agroforestry, carbon offsetting, ecosystem services and forest monitoring projects in protected biodiversity regions. This project qualifies under all the current future policy scenarios as an ""ecologically sound investment"". Project investors are investing in planting cacao tree seedlings, forest monitoring of protected territories, a cacao post-harvest facility, a cacao research laboratory, and an indigenous operated chocolate factory. Planned investment is both non-taxable and medium-term (5 years-10 years+), ownership is in a US based LLC with a full cooperative stakeholder privileges (one member one vote) that limits investment at 0.5-10%, the maximum number of voting participants is based on the number of 1% or greater owners. The territory of the Piaroa People is larger than Belgium, it is over 33,000 square kilometers (7.2 million acres) and has the capacity to sequester over 130 million tons of atmospheric carbon per year, in 2019 the sovereign Huottuja people formed a government and is now sourcing all of their ecosystem services through their court and tribal council.  The ""Indigenous Chocolate"" Trademark Project seeks to break the foundation of Big Chocolate demanding a tribute for the use of the 'biocolonial' Theobroma cacao (L.) genome which has been proven to originate within the Amerindian territories of the Piaroa, Yekuana and the Yanomami on the Guiana Shield in Brazil, Colombia, Guyana, and Venezuela. Although anthropologists and ethnobotanists have traced it to Ecuador, the regions of the Andes they identified did not exist geologically or geographically yet; Theobroma cacao was determined to be at least 10 million years old; wild Theobroma cacao found in nature can only be traced to the 1) Guiana Highlands and the 2) Eastern Andes of Peru and Ecuador; all other cacao in the world originates from these two regions and can be traced to these locations genetically by examining the DNA. Either way it is the intent of Globcal International to represent the Indigenous Peoples of the Americas to protect their Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property (ICIP).          Our project calls for producing high-quality added value ceremonial, nutritional and medicinal couverture (indigenous chocolate bars) from natural wild-grown heirloom variety organic cacao. The proprietary methods, recipes and techniques are safe with the indigenous producers in our factory, the indigenous people are happy because they never saw anything like this before and the investors are happy they have exclusive rights over the international marketing and distribution of a product that is in high-demand among connoisseurs of fine chocolate from aromatic cacao connected to a particular region.   All of the harvest of wild cacao and production into chocolate will be managed by trained, competent and reliable indigenous women and young people from 13 villages who will be producing chocolate remotely on a property that is owned by Globcal International located 24 kilometers inside their territory at the end of the protected area easement established in the 1970s, the Huottuja Foundation and the Special Indigenous Jurisdiction encompasses an area the size of Belgium (30,000 square kilometers) of mostly unbroken hinterland forest. The investment period reopens September 01, 2022 through Private Placement Memorandum (PPM) Invitation to members of the Huottuja Foundation of $10,000 each which is equivalent to 1% of the company. The business plan has been written, 1% or greater investors can take an active role in the non-profit Indigenous Chocolate business, claim a distributorship in Australia, Europe, or North America, investors can be repaid in cocoa beans if they want, or be a silent investor to wait for the investment to mature.  The project will also be backed and funded in part through a Tax-Exempt Charitable Bond Issue being organized under Ecology Crossroads Cooperative Foundation (ECCF). The bond will be to provide critical infrastructure and training in the 13 communities that will make up the core group of cacao farmers, agroforesters and food processing employees (chocolate makers). The bond will guarantee and facilitate a sustainable indigenous economy and autonomous governance with new community centers, solar charging stations, street lighting, transportation and public bath houses. The $10,000 ECCF Huottuja De'AruhuÃ¤ Bond will cost $5,650.00 and mature on December 31, 2030. At that time, only bond investors can cash in the bond or remand the bond for its equivalent in cooperative shares held be Ecology Crossroads.  Exclusive US, Canada and European distribution and non-profit sales of authentic indigenous cacao, cupuaÃ§u, fruits, teas, flowers and chocolate based ceremonial, medicinal and nutritional products made by the HuottÃ¼ja | De'aruhuÃ¤ People (Piaroa Nation) of South America on the Orinoco River. Exclusive distribution for the De'Aruhua Cooperative (Indigenous Cacao and Chocolate) Program of the Huottuja Foundation in Puerto CarreÃ±o, Colombia, a social enterprise that builds sustainable development and promotes conservation in cocoa growers villages.","Agriculture and Farming, Consumer Goods, Food and Beverage, Health Care, Science and Engineering, Sustainability",3,"David Wright, Hortimio Ochoa, Simeon Moreno",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
