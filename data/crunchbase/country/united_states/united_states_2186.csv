As busy, full-time working parents who know the importance of a healthy lifestyle, Stacy and Tyler had long wished for a business that offered healthy, already cooked meals that could be obtained conveniently. Stacy grew up in Bloomington, graduating from Bloomington South High School in 1995.  She received her undergraduate degree from Indiana University and her Juris Doctorate degree from the Indiana University Maurer School of Law.  Tyler was born and raised in Bloomington, graduating from Bloomington South High School in 1994.  He played collegiate baseball at Indiana State University and professionally in the Toronto Blue Jays Baseball Organization from 1998-2002. After years of wishing someone else would open a business like The Fresh Fork, and after years of wanting to own a business, Stacy and Tyler decided that “someone” would be them.  Both Stacy and Tyler had studied healthy eating, applied the principles in their own lives, and wanted healthy meals to be available to everyone in a convenient way. With a business plan in place, construction of The Fresh Fork began in March 2016 and the doors opened to the public in May 2016.   A full commercial kitchen is located at 338 S. Walnut Street where the meals are prepared, packaged and offered for pick-up or delivery to individuals and local establishments. The Fresh Fork is truly a local, family-owned business.
