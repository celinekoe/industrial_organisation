Our focus is providing clients high growth, managed Roth IRA accounts.","723,986",Western US,,Closed,2014-09-11,day,,,,none,For Profit,http://rothbuilders.com,"Fortunes are made in real estate. Our focus is providing clients high growth, managed Roth IRA accounts specifically focused on the wholesale acquisition and re-sale of real estate properties or the short term financing of wholesale properties. We focus on discounted properties such as foreclosures, bankruptcies, and other situations where the owner is motivated to sell at below appraised value.  Roth Builders LLC has identified a huge market for managed IRAs that have a much larger yearly growth than the usual IRAs and has formed a custom business that has a potential market of 300 million people in the United States and yet there is very little competition. Revenue will come four different ways. First, by recognizing capital gains on the sale of properties purchased and then “flipped”. Second, from a $475 membership fee to setup client’s Roth accounts invested by Roth Builders in real estate. Third, from a $75 yearly accounting fee for Roth Builders IRA accounts. Fourth, from short term financing of wholesale properties through various means. Our principal objective is to generate attractive investment returns for Roth retirement accounts.   We have a muli-state network of professional real estate investors looking for the best investments in the hottest areas of real estate for us.   Roth Builders uses Equity Trust as custodian for Roth IRAs. (www.trustetc.com) Equity Trust has over 30 years experience in the self-directed IRA industry with over 130,000 clients with more than $12 billion of retirement plan assets under custody. IRA contributions are handled by Equity Trust which purchases memberships in Roth Builders LLC. Roth Builders goal is simple - to build the largest IRA account possible in the shortest amount of time. There is a retirement crisis in this country and it is growing worse. Everyone wishes they had more money for retirement. We can provide a solution to the problem, our success will be hinged on a good advertising campaign.","Financial Services, Lending and Investments",,,1-10,1,,150000,USD,150000,150000,USD,150000,,,,,Private,,,,,,
