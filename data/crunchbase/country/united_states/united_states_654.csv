At its inception in 2002, the Founders chose to take a new approach to operating a mechanical services business. That tactic was to use technology to streamline the operations and provide clients real time advice and potential for solutions to problems that were encountered. To that end, the founders began work on what was to become KTrack.  Since 2003, Knott Mechanical has been using the KTrack platform to manage all aspects of asset management and maintenance for their clients. Using this robust software platform, Knott Mechanical has been able to realize a 120% increase in worker productivity and 200% increase in revenue per truck. Over the past three years, the KTrack founders have consciously evolved KTrack from a custom software product for internal use to a SaaS platform that serves as a bridge between the design, construction, operations and maintenance stages of construction and/or renovation of a facility. The Company has secured key customer wins in partnership with Whiting Turner: Maryland’s Wicomico County Public School District and Bexar County, Texas 911 Center.
