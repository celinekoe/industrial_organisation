The Two Brothers team has always been creative, from their early days of starting new and advanced technology companies to now as innovators in the worldwide market for quality products. They soon learned about digital printing techniques but were still amazed by what could be done with these advancements when they chose Giffywalls - a company that focuses solely on online shopping walls!

The design takes advantage of the increased water pressures below sea level to tighten the case during deep dives. The greater the depth, the greater the pressure, the greater the seal. While they may not very well be diving into the abyss here at Supercompressor — only on weekends! — they are diving into the bleeding edge of technology, gadgets, gear, vices, and rides. It's their mission to bring you the coolest stuff money can buy, and even the priceless stuff that it can't. Launched in 2013, Supercompressor.com is your daily source for the groundbreaking and good-looking, the luxurious, ludicrous, and downright awesome. They're not your average bunch of tech nerds: with eyes on function, design, and innovation, they're on the hunt for what truly inspires and impresses us — plus a few bizarre odds and ends just for the laughs. They do their damnedest to sort through the riffraff, and they understand that your time and money are precious; they solemnly swear to never waste either. To that end, along with their compadres at Thrillist and JackThreads, they’re dedicated to making the experience of buying the stuff they endorse as painless as possible, which is why they’ve gone above and beyond to actually stock some of their favorites, shipped directly from their warehouse to your home. Check in for their regular roundups and features, like the most legit cars to hit eBay, tech that hasn't even been made yet, tributes to manly American style icons, things you never knew you didn't know, helpful hacks, brand introductions, and their seriously weird, definitely frowned-upon product experiments.",Information Technology,,,251-500,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
