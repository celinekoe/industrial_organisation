GO TRADITIONAL, OR GO HOURLY The traditional, commission-based model is best for consumers who are not sure they will close a sale; it guarantees them that at the conclusion of their agentâ€™s service, if no sale results, they have absolutely no obligation to compensate their agent for time and expenses.   In the pay-as-you-go model, the consumer pays the agent only for the services provided on a semi-monthly basis, just as they would an attorney or engineer.  This model works great for consumers who are sure they will buy or sell, and want to reduce their side of the brokerage costs.  The savings over the traditional commission model can be greater than 1.5% of the sales price.  THE CONSUMER MAKES THE CHOICE  Either way, the compensation decision is in the client's hands.

The premise was to save the user valuable time and money. Highly effective and cost efficient, ElectroniClaim® electronic medical claims processing software packages have all been based on the ability to file claims without the use of a clearing house. NO PER-CLAIM CHARGES! The developers, authors and publishers at Empire Medical Review Services, Inc., created the first ElectroniClaim® practice management software as a state of the art, medical claims processing solution for healthcare professionals. It had the ability to file electronic claims directly with payers as early as 1992. It has always been their belief that the billing functions in American medicine should be as advanced as the diagnostic and treatment processes they represent. The adoption and use of established industry standards helps to reduce errors and overhead which eat into the increasingly limited resources available for the delivery of actual health care. Reducing costs through accurate state of the art communication has always been their vision. They are now known mostly by their trade style as ElectroniClaim®. They have developed software packages from billing and practice management to claim file translators to claims receiving and now full blown clearinghouse packages. With the advent of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, HIPAA, they have been active in helping providers understand and comply with the complex requirements of the Administrative Simplification portion of the act. Their newest software product, ClearingMagic, is designed to facilitate direct communications between provider organizations and payers. It includes features and functionality that have been out of reach of all but the largest organizations. Now these functions are available in software that can function in a solo practitioners office or scale up to a large enterprise. If you want to participate in the promise of the cost saving from Administrative Simplification give us a call. You will be glad you did. ",Information Technology,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

A vast majority of men's testosterone boosters (and a wide swath of supplements for that matter) include a variety of ingredients that are either under-dosed or proven to be ineffective through research. By creating a supplement for the men's health market using tried and true data, we're breaking the industry mold and giving men something that will not only promote testosterone levels but overall health and well being. The big problem we're addressing is that men's testosterone levels are on a 40 year decline from environmental factors such as over-farming, improper nutrition from fast/junk food, estrogen mimicking chemicals in our food and water supplies, not to mention the everyday pollution from our daily environment and of course, stress. We've seen and understand the research that these testosterone deficiencies can be corrected through supplementation with the right vitamins, minerals, nutrients and ayurvedic herbs. Our formula is built to help men increase their testosterone levels to a maximized normal range, at the top of their body's natural capabilities. Testosterone isn't just for working out at the gym which is a common misconception. There are additional health, psychological & cognitive benefits of higher testosterone. One could argue that testosterone is the most important hormone for men's overall health and well-being.","Food and Beverage, Health Care",1,Chris Walker,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Agricultural Food Systems (AFS) is a company focused on transforming food quality measurement. It seeks to increase value and build trust among agricultural producers, processors, and consumers. AFS offers a new product to assess meat tenderness accurately: the TenderID.  Large beef processors in the United States have the opportunity to earn over $75 million in additional annual revenue by measuring meat tenderness effectively. According to the USDA, “tenderness is the most sought-after guarantee for all levels of the meat industry's sales cycle, & surveys show that consumers are willing to pay a premium for meat that is guaranteed tender.” However, the beef industry hasn't found a way to meet consumer needs yet. This shortcoming means tough beef product remains “a costly & contentious issue for everyone involved in putting meat on the table.” Agricultural Food Systems provides beef processors with the ability to accurately measure beef tenderness so that they can more effectively communicate meat quality to consumers. Additionally, the company’s product, the TenderID, provides processors with an average of $24.40 in additional revenue per carcass. The product gives them the advantages of more efficient processing and consistently accurate tenderness measurements.
