The Tuverl Operator App empowers Drivers and Operators with tools to broadcast the live locations of their vehicles, manage their fleets, and process fares digitally. This helps these two stakeholders to increase the number of commuters per trip, increase the number of trips per day and reduce the usage of resources like fuel and man-hours that are wasted by randomly searching for commuters.

Called PolyCrumb, the product is a replacement for virgin resin used in plastic extrusion and injection molding machinery, but with far broader application and versatility. Importantly, PolyCrumb can be made with up to 100% recycled materials, making it a game-changing product.    Current plastic extruders and injection molders contend with tight margins, in the region of 5 - 7%. Because of PolyCrumb's unique characteristics, its application in the production process can result in immediate and significant cost savings, resulting in increased profit margins of 25% to 50%. Reasons include:    - PolyCrumb can be injection molded at lower temperatures  - Using PolyCrumb results in less shrinkage and faster cooling times of the end product  - The price of PolyCrumb is lower than virgin resin    They make PolyCrumb using a proprietary process that mixes rubber from scrap tires with various polymers, whether virgin or recycled, to create an entirely new composite compound. The product comes in the form of granular pellets and has applications as both a polymer and an elastomer.    PolyCrumb demonstrates environmental responsibility. Scrap tires continue to pose a serious environmental headache, as a lack of a cost-effective industrial application results in millions of scrap tires being dumped in landfills across America.     To date, they have tested the product, proven the ability to manufacture at any given quantity, and made initial presentations to customers. Customers have shown incredible enthusiasm for PolyCrumb, and their feedback has been essential to optimizing their product offering. This has resulted in an initial basket of around 20 PolyCrumb products, each with slight variations to meet differing needs.    Their reason for this round of fundraising is to execute an almost vertical sales growth. Based on current indications, they could be at a $12 million run rate by year-end.","Manufacturing, Transportation",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
