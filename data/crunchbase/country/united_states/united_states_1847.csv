The Niddel Magnet solution applies supervised machine learning and data science concepts to automate at scale the kind of decisions that human analysts make, streamlining their workload. It's a force multiplier of security teams that automates the detection of compromised machines, helping organizations eliminate irrelevant alerts and find new interesting investigation leads without the need of existing signatures, searches or detection rules.

SwingShot has developed an innovative GPS-enabled video camera specially designed to enable a golfer to record their “real” swing out on the golf course without help from anyone.  SwingShot appeals to golfers looking to improve their game and those who simply want to remember and share their favorite rounds of golf. SwingShot’s Cyclops™ on-course cameras are high-end HD video cameras mounted atop a 3-foot high shaft with a stainless steel turf spike making it easy to position and record anywhere on the golf course.  Serious golfers know the best way to improve your game is to analyze video of your swing. Most swing analysis videos are recorded on the driving range out of convenience. Yet, golfers know they swing better on the range, where they hit 20 balls in a row with the same club from a perfect lie than they do on the course, where they switch clubs on each shot and hit from the fairway, rough, bunkers, and various lies.  SwingShot is part of the ~$1 billion action video camera market. The largest player is Woodman Labs, which sold nearly $600 million worth of its GoPro cameras and accessories in 2012.   Every year there are nearly 500 million rounds of golf played by over 27 million golfers each year in the U.S. alone. These figures are nearly doubled when the international market is factored in. The typical avid golfer has disposable income, which they spend on golf. Management projects the on-course golf camera niche could exceed $100 million within 5 years, and SwingShot is poised to dominate this niche.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Media and Entertainment, Software, Sports, Video",2,"Pat O'Donnell, Woody Nash",1-10,2,,750000,USD,750000,750000,USD,750000,,,,,Private,,,,,,
