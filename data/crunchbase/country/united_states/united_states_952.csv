A house and industrial building prove the concept. It can: (1) halve heating and cooling equipment, operation, maintenance and replacement cost for most buildings; (2) covert heat to usable energy; and (3) cost-efficiently re-insulate existing buildings. Soleil Insulation has completed its development and design, and is now offering the exclusive license to multinational companies. No outside funding has been received to date. The total investment needed to complete the business plan is $125,000. The strategy is to receive a license fee within 12 months to repay all investment, royalty payments within 12 to 24 months, and a fixed-formula sale within 5 to 7 years. The agreement would include a marketing and sales or sub-licensing obligation, a period of exclusive use, and then an obligation to license at a fixed-formula royalty to all comers. Roof or wall surface insulation prototypes and controls are currently being designed and made for testing by fiberglass and other multinationals manufactures, the Lawrence National Laboratory's Energy & Environment Group; and to the California’s Energy and Building Standards commissions. Only one multinational manufacturer is needed to effectuate our mission: to make Low-E technologies available worldwide at competitive prices. We are working with multinational companies, several with more than a billion dollars of annual insulation sales, and all doing business in more than 50 countries. These include multinationals such as DuPont, Knauf, Bayer’s Material Science Division, Saint Gobain’s U.S. subsidiary, CertainTeed.
