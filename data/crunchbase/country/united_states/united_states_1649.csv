Harrison Barnes, the Founder and CEO of LawCrossing, started his career as an attorney himself.

This led to the advent of LawCrossing which was launched in July 2003.  With more than 140,000 legal jobs online and growing, this site is the world's most comprehensive legal job board. LawCrossing closely monitors and analyzes the recruiting and hiring needs of more than 250,000 legal employers.  These employers belong to virtually every law firm, corporation, government office, and public interest organization in the United States and LawCrossing helps them in getting the right job candidates.  A unique feature of the working of LawCrossing is that the company does not charge employers to post their jobs.  Instead, LawCrossing contacts and investigate thousands of employers each and every day to learn of new positions. Thousands of law students, associates, attorneys, and legal staff browse for jobs and become aware of the latest happenings through law-related career news and articles on the site.  Many LawCrossing subscribers say that they benefit immensely from the constantly updated new legal jobs and news and articles of the legal market.

A significant percentage of American attorneys and law students subscribe to LawCrossing.

Noad,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/noad,"Computer, Software","Brooklyn, New York, United States",NOAD is the pioneer in Enterprise Platform Management for Business Intelligence (BI) pure play vendors.,"674,068","Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",Less than $1M,Active,2000-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,http://www.noadbi.com/,"NOAD, incorporated in 2000, is the pioneer in Enterprise Platform Management for Business Intelligence (BI) pure play vendors. Since the first release of its solution EQM, NOAD continues to have a strong focus for Business Objects, the leading BI vendor. NOAD’s software solutions are designed to monitor and control enterprises’ (distributed) BI deployments, seamlessly promote interoperability, enhanced functionality, and increased cost transparency to maximize return on investment while being compliant with regulations and governance. With BI being a commodity, several BI vendors were forced to develop API’s to more generic, open source version control solutions. However, organizations using enterprise business intelligence as a mission critical technology, demand a controlled and secure development process, reduced deployment costs, and compliance with regulations. NOAD fulfills these demands by bridging the divide between Dev and Ops teams with a single solution.  Over the past 16 years, NOAD has built a global base of more than 300 blue chip customers in over a dozen countries and across all verticals. Since its reorganization in 2013, NOAD services its customers directly from the United States and the Netherlands and in a sign that highly-skilled Indian talent remains much in demand to drive innovation, NOAD established its R&D center in India. Above all, NOAD pledges it continues to partner with leading pure play vendors to help their mutual customers maximize the value of their investment.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Software",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Their objective: organize teachers for the improvement of the profession and local public schools. Today, CEA is headquartered in Hartford with a membership of more than 43,000. CEA members include K-12 teachers in Connecticut public schools as well as retired teachers and college students preparing to become teachers. Since its founding more than 160 years ago, CEA has been a grassroots organization that is a strong and effective champion for teachers and public schools. CEA lobbies for pro-education legislation at the state and federal levels, advances and protects the rights of teachers at the bargaining table, and works with state policymakers to continue to elevate the teaching profession and promote public education. CEA has initiated or been the primary sponsor of state legislation to improve the teaching profession and public education since its beginning. It is the key reason that CEA - the state's largest public employee organization - located its headquarters just steps away from the State Capitol. CEA is a state affiliate of the National Education Association which is headquartered in Washington, D.C. CEA has more than 160 local affiliates and is governed by an approximately 35-member board of directors, elected by members. The board meets regularly throughout the year to set goals, approve policy, and implement specific measures adopted by CEA's highest-policy making body, the Representative Assembly (RA). The RA meets annually each May. Nearly 600 elected delegates from CEA's local affiliates meet during the two-day meeting to conduct the business of the Association. This includes approving a budget, adopting resolutions, voting on new business items, and making any amendments to the CEA constitution and bylaws. CEA's four executive offices, president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer, are also elected at RA. Elected to three-year terms, they can serve a maximum of two terms. The president and vice president are full-time officers. CEA's staff is headed by an executive director who oversees staff in Hartford and in CEA's nine regional offices. CEA has a staff of 24 UniServ representatives who work from these regional offices to provide a multitude of services and programs directly to members.",Education,,,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

When a child wearing one of our shirts wanders off, the B’ZT App issues alarms to prevent any missing child.  Most of the tracking devices in the market are expensive with monthly subscription fees, and battery recharging is required. They are easy to loose and uncomfortable to wear especially for young children. In contrast, B'zT's washable tracking device is pre-embedded in a t-shirt. You can machine wash it, you don't need to recharge the battery. There is no subscription fee. B'zT's application of technology is non-intrusive and so simple that you don't even think it's a tracking device. You can treat B'zT just as a regular t-shirt and enjoy all the benefits of the technology.  After a lost-and-found experience that Kiyeon had with her 3-year-old daughter at a shopping center, she was shocked to find that most tracking devices are expensive with monthly subscription plan. As a mother of two children and a 20 year fashion industry veteran in New York City, she decided to develop a tracking device that is affordable, machine washable, has no battery recharging required, allows group tracking, and works anywhere in the world. After filing a patent in 2015, she and her team worked hard to bring B'zT to the market where it has already received recognition as one of the top tracking solutions. One of the drawbacks of conventional tracking devices is the fact that they are easy to loose. Between charging and paying monthly fees for maintenance, parents and caregivers gets frustrated when the battery runs out or forgot to charge when you need to use. What if a parent has 5 children to monitor or a teacher has 30 students to track on a field trip? what if a whole entire school wants to monitor children every day in a least intrusive way? What if parent wash tracking device as if it's a regular clothing? Now with B'zT, for the first time in human history, we can do this all for our children's safety. Despite just coming into the market in 2017, B'zT has already received recognition from PC Magazine and others as one of the top tracker solutions for children. B'zT was honored to receive a Female Founder Recognition Award from Greylock Partners and TechCrunch, Edison Award Nominee for 2019 and obtained NYC DOE vendor's license in 2018. Through numerous presentations to school PTA, B'zT has been gaining recognitions by parents and teachers and laying foundations for B2B sales. Several schools in Korea has adopted B'zT school system and a private school in Flushing adopted the system. B'zT's website and Amazon store are showing steady increase in sales. B'zT is an integration of 100% Cotton t-shirt and 100% biodegradable eco friendly chipset molding. B’zT® Chipset is designed with battery activation button which allows battery power to last up to a year. B’zT's innovative molding material allows B’zT’s intricate electronic circuits to be protected from multiple washes so that from the perspective of parents and children, B'zT is just like any another t-shirt. B'zT believes when technology in the backdrop is non-intrusive, we can emphasize the positive means of human connection and provide children the sense of safety, security and confidence.","Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Clothing and Apparel, Community and Lifestyle, Consumer Electronics, Design, Hardware, Internet Services, Navigation and Mapping, Other",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
