We see this happening through self-checkout, robocalls, and self-ordering kiosks replacing workers. DoorDash and UberEats have sped up the innovation to find drones to deliver food, and self-driving cars will soon replace humans in the delivery field. We are losing human jobs to computers more and more each day. The problem is that most of these national brands are operated by franchisees and do not have the funds to add full automation to their stores.  Smart Trainer is a hybrid option that uses technology to help provide efficient training in the store and make the job easier. Adding the Smart Trainer in the store will cost less than one team member turnover, allowing operators to make this a no-brainer deal!
