Gift cards are their core product, not just a poorly understood add-on as is the case with most offerings by credit card processors. eCard Systems is focused on providing results-getting products, systems and services at the lowest possible cost without cutting corners on quality. For example, they could sell thermal-printed cards (at a slightly lower price) instead of the industry's top standard: credit-card quality, heat-press laminated cards. But you and your customers would notice the difference. They believe that paying a little less for an inferior product is ultimately not in the best interest of their customers. Gift cards are a product just like anything else in your inventory. How your gift cards and packaging looks and feels can affect sales by 100% or more. Fortunately, because of the large volume of card production they do, eCard Systems' customers do not pay a premium for the premium-quality cards they produce for them.

MedHub,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/medhub,Project Management,"Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States",MedHub is a web-enabled enterprise medical education management solution.,"227,170","Great Lakes, Midwestern US",$10M to $50M,Active,2002-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,http://medhub.com,"MedHub was formed as the result of several successful projects completed for The University of Michigan Health System in 2002-2003. The genesis of MedHub came from the initiative to develop a collaborative web based shift/call scheduling engine for Surgery residents. As regulatory pressures increased, it became apparent manual and ad-hoc methods of documenting all forms of essential education related activities for varied groups of stakeholders was no longer satisfactory. MedHub unilaterally developed additional functions to address many of these needs. Like many large academic teaching hospitals, The University of Michigan had 90+ residency and fellowship programs operating as 90+ independent fiefdoms. The effort required to document and manage data for residency program accreditation was significant. The effort required to manage rotation, shift/call and continuity clinic schedules for activity assignments, affiliated institutional billing and Medicare reimbursement was even greater. The amount of redundant effort associated with validating and correcting data for audit was costly and unacceptable. In 2003, Michigan distributed a comprehensive request for proposal for a comprehensive and unified approach to all aspects of residency management. At that time, The University of Michigan evaluated all available systems in the marketplace and MedHub. The reason was the MedHub approach to residency management was simply different than the others.  MedHub only deploys its system across an entire enterprise and does not sell to individual residency programs. A system built from the ground up as an enterprise-only system is significantly different in workflow and approach to a system that was designed to be deployed in a single residency program. Addressing the complex interactions that occur between all programs and all stakeholders is endemic to MedHub.  .   In every case where a decision to consider an enterprise approach is made, MedHub is not only competing against other residency management systems, residency programs within those institutions are almost always already using a competitors system.  So being: ”just as good”, isn’t good enough.   In the past 20 months, eight of MedHub’s most recent nine GME contracts have been with institutions that have switched from a competitors residency management system. In a relatively short amount of time, MedHub has been selected by a number of the top academic teaching hospitals because of its ability to handle complex stakeholder relationships within complicated environments. MedHub routinely develops institution specific interfaces and exports to existing legacy systems and has become the sole-source-of-truth for essential real time data that needs to be error checked and accurate. MedHub is committed to aggressive system improvement and evolution. They release three upgraded versions of MedHub annually – 2 minor, 1 major. These releases are based upon recommendations made by their current clients. Releases are robust and in many cases include functions beyond the scope of a medical education management system.","Administrative Services, Other",4,"Jenny Davis, Paul Gauger, Peter Orr, Thomas C.

The company's initial focus was the management of HVAC equipment and gradually expanded into providing comprehensive facilities management services. The business focused on operational productivity and cost efficiency by streamlining the maintenance processes for customers with geographically dispersed locations. This powerful platform appealed to the Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company (HSB), America's oldest and largest provider of equipment breakdown insurance, as a means to better manage the assets of their customers. In 1997, HSB acquired TSN and named the new entity Integrated Process Technologies (IPT). The vision of HSB was to combine their in-depth knowledge of equipment and causes of equipment failure with IPT's data collection and operational management technologies. In September 2000, Enron Energy Services acquired IPT in support of their aggressive facility management expansion with Fortune 500 clients. Enron invested $35 million in technology, infrastructure, and process mapping to create a scalable entity capable of handling over one million customer locations. In the Fall of 2008, IPT changed its name to FM Facility Maintenance. The new name better reflects an evolution in the company's business from process technology to a very sharp focus on facility maintenance.
