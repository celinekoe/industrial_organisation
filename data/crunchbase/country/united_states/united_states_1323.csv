Designed to model the common “I do, We do, You do” teaching model WordParts provides physical (kits) and software (Tablet Apps) products that teachers and parents can use to teach children parts of speech, sentence structure, and writing techniques. The cornerstone of our solution is the use of 3-D shapes to represent parts of speech.  The tactile nature of using 3D shapes improves students’ cognitive skills.
