Yet, despite the enormous volume of business commerce, business-to-business (â€œb2bâ€) buyers, unlike consumers, have no easy way to find and evaluate companies that can provide them with the products and services they seek. Zubican solves that pain by offering a free, ad-supported, online b2b community that enables b2b buyers to identify and research companies that best match their needs. From the day zubican.com launched publicly in July 2008, users have been able to perform with unprecedented precision, detailed searches of a database that includes more complete and comprehensive profiles on U.S. companies than any source freely available online. Companies are encouraged to take control of their profiles and customize their content to tell the world who they are and what they offer so buyers can find them. Companies can link their profiles with others to demonstrate the depth and quality of their business network and to identify the shared relationships they have with potential customers and vendors, thereby providing value to both buyers and sellers. As a result, users benefit directly from this â€œdouble-viral-loopâ€ of promoting the Zubican community and in so doing, growing awareness, driving traffic, and encouraging increased usage of the site.","Commerce and Shopping, Other, Transportation",,,11-50,1,M&A,,USD,,,USD,,Tech Coast Angels,,1,,Private,,,,,,

The year 2011 saw the second largest number of tornadoes recorded in one year’s time. I watched the news reports with concern. The tornado outbreaks occurred, and the stories of displacement continued. The same complaints were recounted by different people throughout the United States: temporary shelters in gymnasiums were often overcrowded and lacked privacy and security; hotel rooms were often too far from the original community; FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Association) trailers were not deployed quickly enough and there were often not enough of them; rental homes and apartments were in short supply and were unfairly priced post-disaster. The consequences of these limited and imperfect approaches have been higher costs for government and insurers and the breakdown of communities after a disaster. I wondered why there were no new solutions to address these limitations. Close to Home (Housing) is the product of those questions and also of reflections about the issue from a perspective of sustainability on many levels. First, how can they help a community to build back more quickly? How can they prevent the loss of community cohesion—which can truly see people through the darkest of their days? If people move away from a community, whether temporarily or permanently, emotional threads are lost, leaving community ties at risk. At Close to Home, they are working toward solutions, with the understanding that housing people close to home post-disaster has positive ripple effects in numerous realms of life for communities that are rebuilding and restoring.",Real Estate,,,1-10,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,Fledge,1,1,,Private,,,,,,
