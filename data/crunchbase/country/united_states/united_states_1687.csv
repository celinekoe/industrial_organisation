When customers research products at home with internet searches, they must open a browser, type in the right keywords to find the information they are looking for, and then be willing to go down the “rabbit hole” of the internet. Rather than disrupting the natural shopping experience, Converge™ merges the richness of online with in-store. When a customer moves the tablet in front of a product on display, the consumer automatically gets all of the rich content that could be found online, but with no typing, no searching, no back and forth between multiple products. The experience is designed to integrate seamlessly with the way people naturally like to shop and discover items in-store.
