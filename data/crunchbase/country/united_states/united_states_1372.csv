They study scientific disciplines such as social psychology, neuroscience and behavioral economics, which explain how influence occurs and how the brain creates a buying decision.  What makes this revolutionary, science-based approach to selling so radically different than other traditional sales methods is who it’s focused on.  Unlike most sales systems, they don’t survey  groups of salespeople looking for some sales tips or best practices.  Instead, they focus on what selling should always be centered on — buyers.  Well, more specifically, what science has proven regarding how your potential customers’ formulate buying decisions.  Because the research confirms that the closer your way of selling is with the brain’s decision-making process, the more effective you will be. They are the experts at applying science to selling.  In fact, the CEO and chief sales trainer at Hoffeld Group, David Hoffeld literally wrote the book on science-based selling.
