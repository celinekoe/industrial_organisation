They are also working with key veterinary market opinion leaders to validate utility in animals. The FERTILE and FERTILE PLUS market exceeds $1 Billion.   Providing a method for rapid processing of sexual assault evidence, their Next Generation Differential Extraction (NGDE™) system will enable significant reductions in casework backlogs. More than 840,000 cases annually worldwide involve sexual assault. Evidence processing requires separation of the victim’s cells (epithelial) from the perpetrator’s cells (sperm) and requires time-consuming selective cell lysis, centrifugation and separation into female and male DNA fractions (a process known as differential extraction). Differential extraction has been identified by the USDOJ as a major bottleneck in processing sexual assault samples. Currently, differential extraction involves a labor-intensive 6 to 8 hour process. With their NGDE system, the process will be reduced to under 2 hours and require just 15 minutes of technician time.    With no sample prep required, DxNow's technology can identify and quantify targets ranging in size from eukaryotic cells to molecular analytes (proteins, toxins, drugs, etc.) within a broad dynamic range. Offering performance similar to qRT-PCR, the platform is significantly more sensitive than ELISA. Additionally, there are benefits in cost, speed, logistics, as well as the ability to automate for high throughput applications or configure as a portable, battery-operated system for remote or POC utility.

FNEX,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/fnex,"Finance, Financial Services, FinTech","Indianapolis, Indiana, United States",FNEX is an alternative investment marketplace connecting accredited and institutional investors to investment opportunities.,"141,424","Great Lakes, Midwestern US",$10M to $50M,Active,2014-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,https://www.fnex.com,"FNEX (FNEX, LLC) was launched in late 2014 to fill a market void and create a new private securities marketplace. The FNEX platform launched in September of 2014. FNEX provides advisors, institutional investors, private equity groups, family offices, and accredited investors expanded alternative investments. Listings on its alternative platform are from investment banks and include primary offerings of private placements, hedge funds, and managed futures commodity offerings. FNEX was created to aggregate these offers and serve as a centralized “private securities marketplace.” Investment through Reg D offerings into Alternatives exceeded $1.7T in 2012, 40% larger than funds flowing into the public equity markets. This occurred despite the inefficiencies and current ad hoc approach to sourcing, evaluating and investing in alternatives. Further, only 3% of potential (accredited) investors participated in this market. Investment banks have been restricted to offer these securities to those firms and investors with whom they previously had relationships.  This makes growing a list of potential capital sources difficult and placement of offerings highly inefficient for most small to mid-size banks.  FNEX provides distribution solutions for both before and after the enacting of JOBS Act-related regulations. As FNEX is a password-protected site that offers deals to accredited members.  FNEX develops the necessary relationship to market offerings as soon as the user engages in the initial sign-up process.  This ease of access enables FNEX to reach a number of client relationships well beyond a typical investment banking operation.  Further, our integration with multiple custodian platforms expands issuance visibility. FNEX aims to become the Alternative Investment Platform of choice by RIAs, custodians, family offices, private equity, institutions and high net worth individuals.  Our platform streamlines deal discovery, evaluation and the transaction process. FNEX targets small to mid-market investment banks and offers those groups a means to list their offerings on the FNEX platform for visibility to a much wider investor audience.  The FNEX will allow its partner broker-dealers to list their offerings for free.  If an investor on the FNEX invests in the partner’s offering FNEX will share in the associated fee of the offering broker’s proceeds on a pro rata basis.  FNEX will also offer its partner brokers a fee share for purchases made by the investors they push to the platform.  This structure allows the broker partner to cast a wide net for investment in their private placements, as well as monetize the relationships it has with investors that may participate in offerings outside of the broker’s business line.  Further, banks can utilize our VDR for free. Traditionally, hedge fund offerings have been available only to the extremely wealthy and institutional investors.  Because funds are unable to directly market their investments, the cost of capital introduction/attainment has been high, particularly for emerging managers.  These groups have no or small marketing teams and have focused on large investors due to the high cost of customer acquisition.  Hedge funds are looking for a means to distribute their investment vehicles, and they do not have the internal skills or resources for a broad marketing campaign.  The FNEX provides them a solution.  Now, hedge funds can list, for free, on the FNEX and broadly circulate their offerings to investors on the platform.  The fund only pays the FNEX if they receive a subscription originating on the platform.  As FNEX has an affiliated broker-dealer which earns revenue from broad securities offerings. FNEX seeks to be a smaller part of many deals, instead of a larger part of few deals.  FNEX believes that it can be successful by collaborating with other firms in the market, rather than competing.

Its focus was on providing commercial businesses with the latest in HD Video and IPTV related hardware and programming alternatives and Digital Rights Management for companies large and small. In 2013, Diversified acquired Snader & Associates, with several offices located in California. As a successful and nationally recognized systems integration company they immediately contributed new ideas and talent to the Diversified family. Their executive team, sales account executives, engineers and project managers have all been instrumental in Diversified’s growth and made the company even stronger today. After building successful businesses and becoming dominate marketing leaders in each market segment the marketplace again demanded changes.
