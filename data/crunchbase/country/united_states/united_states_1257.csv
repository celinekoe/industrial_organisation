HOW LONG DOES GG TAKE TO WORK? AND HOW LONG DOES IT LAST? Gamer Goo starts to work immediately, the chosen scent immediately recognizable upon opening the bottle. After application, Gamer Goo quickly dries on your palms, leaving a powdery film that blocks any sweat or moisture. Make sure to wait until Gamer Goo is completely dry before touching anything, as the wet form of Gamer Goo tends to dry on any surface it comes in contact with until it’s removed (just ask my coffee table lol).

Our process reveals multiple candidate diagnostic and therapeutic targets with unique sequences that are expressed in many tumor instances but not in normal tissues. Isommune is in the process of applying its discovery process to much of the transcriptome sequencing data that now exists worldwide.
