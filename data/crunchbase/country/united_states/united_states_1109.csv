Words and images work together to transform a corporate paradigm into a memorable visual, capable of creating a emotional connection with your target market. Integrated into every aspect of your marketing communications, an identity starts with a logo and a positioning statement and grows into a array of other guidelines and standards that define the usage of any element connected with the name. Strong corporate identity, combined with a host of other corporate communication media attract more clients and customers, win their trust and increase brand awareness. • Content development Copywriting has a major impact on what people think of you and your company. Good content development is always a priority. Quality copywriting is rarely about volume and mostly about clarity. People need to understand your message and be moved by it to take action. It should compel and sell your product and / or service quickly and consistently. We make sure your content makes an emotional connection, opens the mind, bridges the gap and builds your brand. • Print advertising Successful print advertising creates an immediate emotional, call-to-action response as it builds equity in your brand. With the proper frequency and research, the prospective client or customer walks away with your core message and is likely to aggregate value to your brand. We create ads that are not only creatively brilliant but also effective in driving leads and sales for products and services. • Collateral material From office stationery, publications, marketing material, packaging, point-of-sale, promotional items to hospitality items. Collateral materials promote, educate sell and inspire. All the printed material we create and produce, strategically brand your organization to prospective customers, clients and associates. • Media planning Identifying the right media for communication is crucial. Understanding target audiences and their segmentation is key to building brand awareness, conversions, transactions and lead generation. Our results-driven approach to media planning helps you collect and understand your company’s demographical position and rapidly increase the awareness of your campaigns. We consult with national media buyers to ensure your negotiated rates are the lowest in your industry. • Radio advertising With the right focus, SMME’s may find that radio advertising can deliver more clients and customers quicker than they thought possible. Planning is essential when approaching radio advertising. The key is to have a clear understanding of the right market, so the message will be delivered to the right audience. Many business owners believe that radio advertising is beyond their advertising budget. What few know is that advertising on local stations can be surprisingly affordable. We will help you find the most cost-effective way to reach your audience and increase brand awareness. • Digital presentations We create custom presentations utilizing a wide variety of techniques. By using the latest in 3D software, in  conjunction with live action video, we can animate client logs and create characters for their brands. We also create TV advertisements, demonstrations, training and informational videos for output to DVD, video-tape or internet.",Software,,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Large national companies are likely to employ risk management staff, with ample resources dedicated to the management of risk. However, owners of small or medium-sized businesses, technology startups and non-profit organizations don't have the same scale of resources to allocate to an internal risk management function. Yet, many small and medium size businesses have the same risk management concerns as larger companies, but because resources are not available at the same scale, the risk management needs of these businesses go unmet. riskthinktank exists to fill that need. They believe that their services can mean the difference between a successful business and failure. Businesses that don't plan for risk, usually end up meeting risk unexpectedly, and unprepared. Risk management is a critical need, and they aim to provide it efficiently and effectively without the cumbersome overhead obligations that larger firms must serve. Businesses who work with riskthinktank will have better risk management, a lower cost of insurance premiums, and will be prepared for whatever comes, with the ability to complete transactions at the highest possible velocity, with the ability to confidently accept risk at a much higher level.","Information Technology, Professional Services",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Without a Will, you have no control over what happens to your money or assets when you pass away. Beyond that, if you do not have a legal Will in place your loved ones may have to spend a fortune on probate and wait months or more to get access to their inheritance. A Will saves your spouse and children money and hassle, and ensures your wishes are carried out. Their service allows people who live in North America to create their own legally compliant Wills online for a small fee. It takes less than a half hour to do, and the result is a Will that will stand up in court in all 50 states. Once your Will is created and signed, you can rest assured that your estate will be handled the way you want and at minimal expense to your spouse and children. They created this service because they think that everyone should be able to create a legally binding Will in the privacy of their own home. If you take the future of your loved ones seriously and want to make sure that you retain control of your hard-earned assets, let them help you create a legally compliant last Will and testament today.",Professional Services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
