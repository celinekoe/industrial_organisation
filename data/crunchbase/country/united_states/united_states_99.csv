After hours of research I fumbled my way into the system and finally bought some Bitcoin, then started trading in other alt coin markets. After I told a friend and spared him the hours of work by guiding him through it, another friend asked me the same thing. I did the same for him, and I ended up teaching a bunch of my friends. They where all curious and wanted to get in, but the process is not intuitive. I made it easy for them and now they are all trading. So, the idea behind this site is to take the pain out of it getting into the crypto currency market space. That’s what inspired me to start this site.

SOCIOPAL introduces a social marketing application that allows small business owners to decrease time spent on social networking and blogging to minutes per week. SOCIOPAL algorithm prioritizes marketing activities. New York (PRWEB) June 05, 2013 SOCIOPAL (http://www.sociopal.com) has introduced a social marketing application that enables small businesses to manage multiple social media sites in just minutes per week. Social media is vital for small businesses to grow, but with so many different social networks, keeping up with the various accounts can be overwhelming and time-consuming. It can also be a daunting task to develop a successful strategy on what to post and how to get more followers. “Small businesses need corporate-level expertise in their marketing endeavors, but rarely have the resources to get it,” said Tamar Shor, CEO of SOCIOPAL. In its easy-to-use, free application, SOCIOPAL has incorporated a prioritization algorithm that guides small business owners on what, when and where they should be publishing and posting to social networks to be successful; while simultaneously monitoring online activity to determine and enhance their future marketing efforts. “The aim of this algorithm,” explained Shor, “is to optimize social marketing through ensuring quality and diverse posting and balancing both where and when posts appear. At the end of the day, small business owners want to focus on their business, not social networking, and SOCIOPAL helps them keep up with what the enterprise level players are doing online without sacrificing everything else.” SOCIOPAL allows small businesses access to advanced marketing tools such as pre-sourced content and scheduling features, which aid small business owners in calendaring professional posts to their Facebook Page, Twitter account and Blog. Nicholas Singer, owner of FITology in Washington D.C. is using SOCIOPAL to manage his online marketing, “I understood the importance of Internet marketing but was overwhelmed with the upkeep of multiple sites. SOCIOPAL helped me to improve my Internet presence while only devoting minutes per week to the project.” SOCIOPAL integrates Facebook, Twitter, and a personal Website & Blog into one seamless application that proposes content and marketing strategies for small businesses. The new application, according to Shor, promises greater efficiency and personalization while minimizing the time small business owners spend working on marketing. About SOCIOPAL SOCIOPAL was founded on the belief that while every small business needs to market via Facebook, Twitter and a personalized Website & Blog, no small business can afford to hire a social marketing expert to do it. Enter SOCIOPAL, a simple, free solution that guides you through the process and keeps your sites fresh in minutes per week. Visit http://www.sociopal.com to find out more. Contact: Tamar Shor is the CEO of SOCIOPAL, the free tool that gets your small business on Facebook, Twitter and a Website & Blog within minutes!

On Campus is capable of running a vast array of diagnostic tests such as toxicology or RPP for private practice medical facilities, providing the end consumer (the patient) with testing that is done in a less stressful and more accurate environment. If you are in need of reaching us, you can at: On-Campus Laboratory Services 166 S. Belknap St Stephenville, TX 76401 (254) 968-6868 Here is a recent interview conducted with our founders: Welcome listeners, this is John Walker speaking for Lab Tech Solutions Network.  We are very happy this morning to bring this to our readers!  For those of you who’ve been paying attention the past couple of weeks, we’ve discussed disruptions in other business sectors, and how a similar thing may begin occurring in our own.  I’ve invited a couple of gentlemen in today, Mr. J. Mac Rust, and Mr. Landon Northcutt of Stephenville, Texas to discuss how a small company that these two men worked together to found might become the ground breaker of a disruptive change in the laboratory testing industry.  John: L. Northcutt, co-owner of On Campus Lab and Mac Rust, with On Campus Lab, we are so appreciative that you have allowed us an opportunity to spend time with you on this episode so that all of us will learn more about this company, On Campus Laboratory Services and the disruption that its’ model is going to possibly bring to the lab services sector. J. Mac Rust: Mr. Walker, you are sincerely welcome.  We’re excited to join you. Landon Northcutt:  Definitely, John, we’re appreciative that you’ve asked us to talk with you and your followers. John:  How about you share with our followers a few details about On Campus Laboratory? J. Mac Rust: No problem Mr. Walker.  On Campus Lab, dumbed down is a service that gets together country hospitals with big city doctors. John:  This seems like it makes sense. Can you tell us what does this relationship look like? Landon Northcutt:  The two of us found that doctor’s offices in metro regions were having to deal with a lot of churn and burn lab services for all of their lab tests and services.  Most of the time these services was performed quickly, but accurateness was a consideration, client service was less than stellar, and it just wasn’t what it used to be.  Being that the two of us reside in a rural city an hour’s drive from Fort Worth, we saw that there are a considerable amount of hospitals in rural cities near here with very expensive lab equipment just sitting there because the communities don’t have a sizable enough local census count in their area to sustain the cost of keeping the labs open. J. Mac Rust: Mr. Walker, inherently, we visualize our role with On Campus as relationship makers between the medical professionals and these rural hospital labs.  On Campus Lab conducts services that includes the deliverer between the clinics and the laboratory testing offices.  We establish relationships between these organizations so that it makes sense to all parties: the hospital owners see a rise in revenues from the lab services being used more, the doctor’s offices are getting a better quality services by a more relaxed staff which are in a more low stress environment, and the patients are receiving answers back that have fewer mistakes, and in the same amount of time or less than it was taking before. John: Jay you bring up an thoughtful suggestion.  You’ve said that you are seeing a quality difference by reason of it being a rural lab testing facility, instead of a large city lab analysis facility.  How about you comment on that a little more? Landon Northcutt:  Sure John, Mac brings up an intriguing suggestion.  What we’ve found is that in a lot of the DFW metropolitan area lab services facilities, they’re really a stressful environment.  They’re processing a large number of laboratory results a day, and employees are pressured to meet deadlines.  This kind of nature as in any area of our lives produces stress.  That stress has shown an effect on the workers, the services being delivered, and the organization itself.  Consequently, that has an effect on the clinics that order the laboratory results, the people being treated, and the community.  We have found that the low anxiety environment of many of our rural medical care facilities makes for more satisfied employees.  These are lab techs whom are well-educated and have the ability to use all of the same lab equipment that you’ll see in the metro, but their environment is not that similar high turnover approach.  So, because of that, they are capable to take the time to be precise and observe procedures with less errors. John:  Gentlemen, what is the mission statement of On Campus? J. Mac Rust: Partnering rural hospitals with progressive minded doctors.  That is what we exist for.  John, we surely think that it takes a forward thinking doctor or out of the box thinker (whatever you want to call it) to understand the beauty in this model.  And, we really think that as a greater number of clinics are discovering new options, that their modus operandi are going to be changed to this model simply because of the necessity of doing things differently. Landon Northcutt: We should make ourselves understood here Mr. Walker.  We’re not positing that small community hospital laboratory testing facilities are going to take over and laboratory services facilities in metro areas are going to die off.  We’re just suggesting that this model is a feasible alternate that a greater number of doctors will undeniably turn to as we progress onward.  There’s more than enough room in this sandbox for all involved to capably get along cordially and everyone have their slice of the action. John: So, tell our readers some more about this business.  What kinds of service does On Campus Laboratory Management LLC manage? J. Mac Rust: Our testing services is composed of: Wellness Blood Testing, Blood Allergy Testing, Pharmacogenetics Testing, Respiratory Pathogen Panels, and Toxicology Panels. John: You have the ability to provide most everything out there? Landon Northcutt:  Pretty close Mr. Walker.  There are a few smaller segments that we haven’t gotten in to yet, mainly because the demand on a local level is so small and the equipment for these laboratories in some cases is kind of expensive.  There is no need to own lab equipment that’s not going to turn a profit for a very long time when we are pretty confident doctors aren’t going to be ordering labs that must have the use of those machines. John: Mac, Shall we get back to the beginning, have you made plans to take over the world? J. Mac Rust:  Landon, I’ll let you answer this…  Hahaha.  Just joking.  No, Mr. Walker, right now, we’re just settling on fixing issues in this industry in Texas.  Beyond a doubt, we see how this model could disrupt the industry in each region, and there is no doubt that others like us are going to figure out how to disrupt the industry in their states and regions.  Texas is a pretty big slice of the pie.  We’ve got our schedules full with this project right now and for the foreseeable future. John:  Well Gentlemen, much gratitude for taking a few minutes with us and entertaining me and the listeners in these questions. J. Mac Rust: You’re welcome for sure John.  Thank you for having us! Landon Northcutt: Yes, John.  Thank you for bringing us on. John: We look forward to learning more about your business and exploring what will lie ahead for you and your business.  Again, many thanks for your time. If you wish to learn more about J.
