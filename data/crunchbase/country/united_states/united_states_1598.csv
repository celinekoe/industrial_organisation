Biopharmaceuticals are much larger and more fragile than traditional small-molecule drugs. Due to their size, large doses of biologics are often required; and because of their fragility, these drugs must be administered by injection instead of orally. Biologics become unstable and extremely viscous at the high concentrations required for traditional low-volume injections. Consequently, they are frequently administered as high-volume, slow intravenous infusions in a hospital setting. From a patient perspective, receiving treatment via subcutaneous administration can be preferable to intravenous infusion. Subcutaneous administration removes the need for invasive IV ports. Administration at home eliminates time-intensive and expensive hospital visits. Achieving high doses of biologics in a volume suitable for subcutaneous administration presents significant formulation challenges. The major limiting factor is viscosity, which arises when biomolecules are formulated at high concentration.  Arsia’s mission is to produce high-concentration biopharmaceutical products with low viscosity, suitable for small-volume subcutaneous injection. Our proprietary platform technology reduces the viscosity of biologics through the addition of inactive ingredients (excipients). Because Arsia’s technology works at the formulation stage, the molecular structure of the drug itself is not affected. Arsia’s technology provides i) a formulation solution for new products in development that have viscosity challenges, ii) a life-cycle management strategy for existing products and iii) a way to differentiate those products from others on the market. For more information on partnering with Arsia, please contact us.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",2,"Alan Crane, Alexander Klibanov",11-50,1,M&A,,USD,,,USD,,Polaris Partners,,1,,Private,,,,,,

These committee meetings also serve as an opportunity for states to network and establish flows of information as well as experience-based suggestions from other states. In addition to the Fall Forum and the Summit, NCSL builds the state legislative community by hosting various web seminars, leadership meetings, and access to relevant websites and online documents throughout the year.
