Labor Notes is also a network of rank-and-file members, local union leaders, and labor activists who know the labor movement is worth fighting for. We encourage connections between workers in different unions, workers centers, communities, industries, and countries to strengthen the movement—from the bottom up. That movement is needed because workers are being hit hard by their employers. We have lower real wages, less job security, and smaller, weaker unions than our mothers and fathers did. For the most part, our leaders are doing a poor job of navigating us through the crisis. Some can’t get beyond business-as-usual; others see the need to organize by the millions, but don't believe that workers themselves need to have a say in their unions. Some unions operate only to service their members’ bread and butter needs instead of encouraging their involvement in a movement to fight the employer offensive and transform our society. With more than 30 years of movement building behind us, Labor Notes exists as a resource for leaders and union members who want to combat these trends and chart a new course for the labor movement.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

As the business matured in the early 1990’s, UPSTATE elected to build on the experience of its ownership and therefore looked outside of the United States for additional growth. North and Central Africa provided almost immediate sales and from this juncture UPSTATE looked more and more to countries overseas for the sale of its offerings. At the same time, UPSTATE continued to realize steady growth in Central New York and in other parts of the United States. To focus on both domestic and overseas growth opportunities, in 1993, Upstate Parts & Supply established NuClimate International Limited (NIL) as a subsidiary of UPSTATE. NIL was given the sole responsibility for all sales outside of the United States. NIL concentrated on exporting of air conditioning, heating, ventilating and refrigeration equipment and parts with a primary operating focus on third world hvac markets. UPSTATE, although being the parent of NIL, continued to service domestic USA HVAC markets with air conditioning, heating, ventilating and refrigeration equipment and parts. In 2003, Upstate Parts & Supply established NuClimate Air Quality Systems Inc. as a subsidiary of UPSTATE to serve the indoor air quality market. NuClimate Air Quality Systems (NAQS) manufactured and sold Chilled Beams & Induction Units through a network of independent representatives in the United States. In January 2018 Zehnder Rittling acquired NuClimate.

Every member of our team has a unique skill set, and we use this to your advantage. In fact, we collaborate the same way with our clients as we do among ourselves, allowing you to fuel the design process. Our work takes many forms to visually tell the story of your product, service or brand. These are the methods in which we deliver your vision. We shape your vision, present it through graphics or a demo and make it a reality through crafting a design and guiding delivery. We believe good design has three parts. It needs meaning, must take a form and has to function. Without even one of these aspects, the true value of design falls apart.  As designers we are in a great position to not only think strategically (design thinking), but to translate your vision by making (design doing). We start by exploring and researching every facet of your product, service or brand. What do your users need? What is the voice and messaging? How can people engage and interact clearly, concisely and definitively? When we have the answers to these questions, we make something to prove it.
