Trly Uniq will offer luxury homes and condominiums in southwest Costa Rica. The housing project consists of 150 acres of a beautiful mountainside overlooking the valley with a small river dividing the property and containing two beautiful waterfalls. It sits in a  town named Platanillo, (elev. 1,100 ft above the bug line) and 4 miles in, as the crow flies from the Pacific Ocean. This is where the estimated 343 single family/ condo units will be located.   The single family units will be 900, 1,200 and 1,500 sq ft indoor, an additional 30% of outdoor living each having a built in swimming pool. The houses will be of vibrant colors, that will be cross between Bermuda and Bahama homes,  nestled among the deep green backdrop of Costa Rica's lush forestry, TRULY UNIQUE to anything ever done or seen in Costa Rica. Because the valley is populated with toucans, the name of the gated community will be known as """"Toucan Valley."""" Each small group of houses will be named after a type of bird native to Costa Rica, and each individual house will be named after a specific bird in its type to   help educate the residents about Costa Rica's native environment. The entire project will be geared to protecting and preserving nature, with built-in sewage plants, solar power, and potable water, with the rain  stored in cistern tanks under each home.  People and families from around the globe are flocking to Costa Rica, seeking future retirement homes.  Vacation rental programs will be available to those who choose to use them.  Trly Uniq is organized as a not-for-profit and has pledged to actively support local Costa Rican schools via financial contributions and sponsored school projects.",Real Estate,,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
