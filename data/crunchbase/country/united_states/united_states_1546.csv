For authors today, creating digital versions of their books is both a costly and timely process. The options to create visually compelling, cross-platform storybooks requires either well-honed programming skills or the funding necessary to hire expensive developers to create these applications. Authorly founder Chris Whitman was one of these developers. After being hired by New York Times Bestselling author Carl Sams to convert the popular children's book Stranger in the Woods into an interactive app, he decided there must be an easier way. Whitman therefore began to build disruptive software that empowers authors to create their own apps. The result is Authorly: a platform perfect for children’s authors, comic book artists, visual novelists, or anyone with a great illustrated story to tell.  Authorly enables artists to create digital storybook applications through an intuitive web-based platform. Our proprietary technology takes care of the tedious aspects of app production, like adjusting each story to fit a multitude of smartphones and tablets and publishing them to iTunes, the Google Play, and the Amazon Appstore. Some of the features authors can add to their apps include basic animations, sound effects, embedded videos, automatically aligned word-by-word voice narration,  panning and zooming, and animated hotspot technology.","Apps, Content and Publishing, Education, Media and Entertainment, Mobile, Platforms, Software",1,Chris Whitman,1-10,3,Seed,640000,USD,640000,640000,USD,640000,"Startup Minds, Curious Minds",,2,,Private,,,,,,
