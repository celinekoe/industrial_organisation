My name is Hojjat “Tom” Tamar and I’m the President & CEO here at City Wide Protection Services, Inc. We are a fully licensed security company in the state of California. We offer a full range of Security Services, Camera & Alarm Monitoring, Consultation, and Security Training.  Our firm was founded in August of 2012 based on the principles of serving with integrity and professionalism above and beyond what is often found in the security industry. I have been in the security industry for more than a decade. I began my career at the age of 18 as a regular security guard watching an empty parking lot. Through dedication and hard work, I worked my way up to higher management. I have done everything there is to do in the security industry from the bottom up. I’ve worked for multiple security firms ranging from small local firms to nationwide corporations. Throughout my career, I’ve seen the good and the bad of the security industry. That’s why in 2012 I started my own company – determined to fix the mistakes I’ve seen others make. I assembled a team of many of the best people I had worked with in order to put our past experience towards providing the best possible security services. Lukas joined the team taking on the role of our Vice President. He comes with years of experience, along with a background in law enforcement, as well as knowing the ins & outs of running his own companies in the past. Our combined experience has helped us take City Wide Protection Services to the next level by seeing new opportunities to serve our clients from all angles. Sam, our other partner, not only keeps track of the pulse on all things financially-related to our company – which provides the stability to serve our clients with excellence – but he is also our Director of HR. He is our voice of reason and has years of experience working with multi-million dollar companies. He has a passion for hiring only the best qualified & most disciplined employees in order for them to surpass the expectations of our clients and to consistently perform with our deep-rooted mission at their core: “serving with integrity.” Together, not only have we been able to provide top quality security services, we’ve now added a Security Academy division, with the intention of passing along our knowledge in this field to new security officers who are joining the industry. We wish we could tell you a great story about the turning point in our firm, but there is none. We started working hard from day one – and when I say hard, we had many 20-hour days. We continue working hard to this day and put in 110% effort to make our clients happy. What we’ve learned and what we want to pass along to the people we encounter throughout this amazing journey is: we are not perfect, we learn from our mistakes, and no matter what happens, continue to move forward. Our recipe for success is true, “serving with integrity”, learning from our experiences, and treating our team members with the respect they deserve as important members of our team. All that being said, we truly believe our team is the best at what we do. We will serve you with integrity. We are not perfect. However, if there are any issues, we will fix it in no time and learn from the experience. That is why we have become one of the fastest growing security firms in the country, nearly doubling in size every year that we’ve been in business.",Privacy and Security,,,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
