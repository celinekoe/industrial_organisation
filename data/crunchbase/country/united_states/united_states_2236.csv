They found trying to connect to cloud-based applications in office LANs to WAN access points around the world, or from hotel rooms while traveling were a challenge due to firewall issues, latency, packet loss, jitter and bandwidth limitations. Further, they learned that buying, selling and supporting hardcoded, hardware-based network solutions based on inflexible hub-and-spoke architectures were a huge issue. Such solutions were hard to deploy, manage and monitor, and could make it difficult to access applications wherever the app resided. They also knew they needed a secure network not just to protect their corporate information, but also because they saw like everyone else that hackers, professional crime syndicates, and third party actors would be at work illegally accessing data however they could. They used that poor internet experience to design and build the next generation WAN solution. They knew that it would take a rethinking of what is required for optimal WAN performance. Minimizing latency, packet loss and jitter was going to take the creation of what they call the Global Virtual Network. A virtual network of servers (physical and virtual), peering relationships and bandwidth with network providers around the world. It turns out that they were also designing a 2nd generation SD-WAN, that took advantage of what this network offered: security and performance delivered quickly. They’ve designed the Secure Network Optimization Service as a result; to make secure network access consumable, easy-to-use, deploy and manage. This service is available to access cloud-based applications for IT executives and managers that need a solution that can help branch offices and datacenters connect with datacenters and hybrid and public cloud-based applications. They offer a free, 2 week trial for those interested in seeing the results in their own organizations and within their IT infrastructure.","Hardware, Information Technology, Software",2,"Jorn Knutsen, Joseph Rubenstein",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Through hard work, determination, and Montana pride, the company became a well-known and respected manufacturer within the dental industry. The company grew to about 75 employees, many of whom forged careers to become some of the dental industry’s best journeymen instrument makers and sharpeners. American Dental was “the” quality dental instrument company. In 1989, a competitor purchased American Dental Manufacturing and subsequently closed its doors in 1990. Rather than follow the buy-out company, a small group of tenacious and persevering crafts people joined forces in 1992 to form American Eagle Instruments. With engineering experience, unequaled skill, a goal to produce the highest quality dental instruments, and a “lead-not-follow” philosophy, American Eagle Instruments became reality. Today, American Eagle Instruments has evolved to become the second largest manufacturer of dental hand instruments in North America. Based in Missoula, Montana, and employing approximately 70 crafts people, AEI remains an employee-owned company. They pride theirselves on providing the world’s finest quality dental hand instruments. Their focus remains on progressive, innovative dental products which allow the practitioner more efficient processes with added ergonomic comfort.","Hardware, Health Care, Manufacturing",,,101-250,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
