This followed on the heels of the company's number one ranking by JupiterResearch in its October 2005 Email Marketing Buyer's Guide. The acquisition of INBOX Marketing strengthens Responsys' position as the largest private and profitable email service provider and builds on its growing recognition as the solution provider of choice for sophisticated email marketers.  ""As a full-service firm to leading brands, we have worked with the top email service providers and have seen many struggle to keep pace with the increasingly sophisticated needs of marketers, from both a technical and strategic standpoint,"" commented former INBOX Marketing President Jerome McLaughlin, now Vice President of Professional Services for Responsys. ""The union of our two companies combines the best of both worlds, bringing together innovative marketing technology and world-class strategic marketing services.""  As part of the transaction Responsys will maintain the San Francisco office of INBOX Marketing and retain all INBOX employees. The INBOX Marketing executive team will assume leadership roles in the professional services organization at Responsys. Jerome McLaughlin will become Vice President of Professional Services and Barry Stamos will assume the role of Senior Director of Strategy for Responsys.","Information Technology, Internet Services, Messaging and Telecommunications, Professional Services",2,"Barry Stamos, Juston Brommel",11-50,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

PopuTrust, LLC owns the popular website www.poputrust.com which offers ""Trusted People Search"" services.  MISSION:  Via its SaaS technology platform (www.poputrust.com) PopuTrust, LLC is focused on becoming the leading source of information about People. With over 10% of all Google searches now ""people related"" ...people are more and more obsessed with ""people"".  PopuTrust is the comprehensive & trusted source of aggregated public information. As a ""meta-search-engine"" PopuTrust allows customers to search at just one location for multiple sources of digital content.     OPPORTUNITY:  People Search is a massive Multi-BILLION dollar market. People no longer just search ""for fun"" on celebrity names - a quick name search is often a precusor to a business meeting, a romantic date, a landlord/tenant relationship, employer/employee screening, college application process, or other research process.  Billions of Searches for name per DAY from the web (i.e. Google) and increasingly from from Mobile Devices. Currently, big data firms are selling this data to the highest bidder...soon...as awareness of this practice grows...individuals will want to own, control, and sell their personal data back to these same marketers.  PopuTrust is where individuals go to take back control of their Online Identity and sensitive Personal Data.   OUR TEAM: PopuTrust was started by a team of tech entrepreneurs and web software engineers with extensive experience building high growth, profitable ventures including VC-backed SaaS (software-as-a-service) businesses. Their passion for building great internet and ""big data"" businesses has created an energy and enthusiasm that is infused throughout 8 staff members & contractors onboard including marketing experts, web programmers, SEO gurus, big data compilation experts, and cutting edge web engineers. ""Big Data"" as it is know has massive technical challenges - as current database technology often cannot keep up with demand. PopuTrust is on the forefront of the ""NO-SQL"" movement. PopuTrust, LLC was formed and incubated at The Market Accelerator - a startup incubator and technology accelerator based on Market Street in downtown Portsmouth, NH and MIT/ Kendall Square, Cambridge, Mass.   FOUNDER:  Eric Melin: Web Entrepreneur, SEO Expert, Technologist, Digital Media Exec & VP at VC-backed SaaS Ventures www.linkedin.com/in/ericmelin COMPANY:    PopuTrust, LLC (www.poputrust.com)  Corporate:   Delaware LLC   Trademarks & Corporate Docs Pending.  Industry:     Internet Technology Financing:    Privately Held. Seed funding via Founders  Seeking:   Interns & Remote/work at home opportunities  Advisors:   Equity compensation available  Investors:   Future investment rounds may include outside investors   Venture Stage:   Prototype with customers, generating traffic & revenue. No Debt.   Competitors:   Intelius (revenues of $150 million), 123people, PeopleSmart, Spokeo, BeenVerified, myLife.com, reputation.com CUSTOMERS: PopuTrust.com offers a free Comprehensive People Search Engine - a useful tool for people who are searching for people and which provide background screening, tenant checks, and in-depth public record searches.  The mission of PopuTrust is to compile comprehensive database of publically available information which allows users to control and manage their online identity.  PopuTrust offers trusted information removal tools and data cleaning tools.  The United States government recently mandated the use of ""E-Verify"" to check and verify employees prior to securing work.  Additional International governments are likely to follow suit.  PopuTrust currently has profiles of 250,000,000 individuals, who are primarily USA based, but plans to include international profiles to encompass a billions of records.  KEY SUCCESS FACTORS:   Founder Eric Melin was previously VP, Business Development of a related People Search business based in Wellesley, Massachusetts which generated 200,000+ website visitors per day primarily through in-bound search traffic (visitors from Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc).   Multi-Million Dollars in Revenue is generated as result of these visitors conducting a search for a person's first & last name. The people search business is highly sensitive to minor technical changes (Search Algorithms) in the Internet Search Engines (i.e. Google) which represents substantial risk to investors. Critical sensitive data is also relatively easy to migrate and easy to steal making data security experts critical to success. Revenue is primarily advertising, affiliate & referral partner based which represents risks from decreasing CPM and overall online ad revenues - however internet people search traffic is projected to only continue to grow.  PopuTrust abides by and supports all best practices and methodologies established by leading data companies (including Google) to assure its long-term success for shareholders.
