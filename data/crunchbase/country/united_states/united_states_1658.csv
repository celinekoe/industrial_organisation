Textbooks converted to e-books - the same, tired, old worksheets completed on an iPad - a lecture delivered with PowerPoint slides - students answering low-level questions with classroom clickers - will yield the same sub-par learning experiences for students.  Research suggests that simply giving every student an iPad or putting a SmartBoard in every classroom leads to little, if any, improvements in student learning outcomes. To achieve the dream of technology transforming student learning, the technology must be built around content that supports and enhances the quality of teaching within the classroom - the technology cannot exist alone and teachers cannot be expected to  effectively incorporate technology on their own. nVizn Ideas is a U.S.-based company that was founded in 2016 by Brent Ford.","Education, Software",1,Brent Ford,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
