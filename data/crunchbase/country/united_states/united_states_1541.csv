Along with our technology services, we became M.A. Services in 2015. We grew the list of services we offer while becoming a top-rated provider on the Amazon.com home services platform, holding a 99.9% customer satisfaction rate with over 5,000 projects completed. With the growth of the company and seeing the need to position our services as separate companies, M.A. Services became The Allsup Company in 2020. As of 2021, The Allsup Company has 3 service brands. Collectively, these concepts offer customers a broad base of residential and commercial services. ​Our brands include Technology Services, Furniture and Fitness Equipment Assembly Services, and Labor Only Movers. ​The Allsup Company provides the best one-stop-shop service for our commercial and residential clients.

Through its renowned editors—who have been nominated for nearly every major aviation journalism award available today—ATW provides balanced international coverage of the airline industry and reports on the trends that affect the way airlines do business. Topics covered in ATW  include airline operations, airline management issues, information technology, safety & security, eco-aviation, alliances, distribution, transport aircraft and engine programs, MRO, aero-politics, regulation, finance and leasing, airport development and air cargo. One of the areas where ATW stands apart from its competitors resides in its six pillar issues each year. Each one is dedicated to a specific topic or research, and airline executives worldwide use these pillar issues for reference, statistics, competitive analysis, planning and strategy. The January issue predicts the Industry Forecast, a comprehensive forecast on the industry for the new year focusing on passenger and cargo traffic, airline financial results and analysis on future trends. It also details the competitive and economic landscape for the aviation industry. Every February ATW announces the winners of the prestigious ATW Airline Industry Achievement Awards, including Airline of the Year. In this competitive environment, airlines focus on what strategic advantages they have and how they compare to the industry standards.    The July issue focuses on the World Airline Report, which provides detailed fleet, financial and traffic information on more than 350 airlines as well as an overview of the key events and trends of previous 12 months that affect the airline industry. September’s World Airport Report is an extensive data-driven report examining the evolution of world airport traffic by region of the world and by type of airport (intercontinental hub, continental hub, regional platform). Supported by Arthur D. Little’s extensive research and data collection, this expansive report identifies success factors among leading airports and analyzes why others may lag behind. The MRO Market Review issue in November provides a great tool to reach the maintenance, repair and overhaul markets. This issue offers an in-depth look at trends and the general state of MRO worldwide. Lastly, the December issue is earmarked for Fleet Planning and Asset Management. As access to capital is limited and there is a high level of uncertainty as to when bank vaults will reopen, this annual issue tackles this matter. In-between issues, keep up-to-date on the latest aviation news through ATWOnline.com, the website of the ATW Media Group. Brief articles are delivered daily via email to subscribers and are available online. Updated daily, the editors write about topics affecting the industry and offer brief summaries of events including traffic and aircraft transaction data, commentary and insight, and articles excerpted from Air Transport World. Also online is the ATW Shop, offering a selection of aviation products geared for the airline enthusiast, including airline-related books, newsletters, industry research, and the annual ATW Classic Airliner Calendar.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Recipe Rx seeks to be a first-to-market online resource providing healthful recipes and meal solutions specifically tailored to an individualâ€™s health profile and preferences. For example, a diabetic client who has tired of eating the same foods will utilize Recipe Rx to find a variety of recipes, prepared food items or even menu items available at local restaurants consistent with their health profile. The user will be further connected to reference material, supplements and health service providers, with the end result that she is fully equipped to make proper food choices and live a healthier life. Customers will have the option to sync existing Google Health or Microsoft Health Vault health profiles with Recipe Rx or access their recommendations via their mobile devices, creating a seamless experience that further empowers healthier decisions.  The core services that Recipe Rx offers lend itself to easy integration of targeted advertising campaigns. Once the user enters their profile information, they are provided with recipes, product suggestions (packaged foods, supplements), and restaurant suggestions. They are also provided with shopping lists where supermarkets or food producers can sponsor results. Similar to a website like Hotels.com which has much of their content built by advertisers, Recipe Rx will receive revenues from directory listings and PPC/CPM campaigns and not be responsible for uploading much of the content from which the user derives value. We believe that the service should be free to the general public, with paid subscriptions available to health care professionals who want the flexibility to customize the portal by which their patient receives recipe suggestions. There are many options for â€œfreemiumâ€ services that the user can upgrade to once they have established trust with our product, but the central short-term focus is on building a solid core product, bringing traffic to critical mass, and monetizing through highly customized pay per click (PPC) and cost per impression (CPM) campaigns in conjunction with their personal recipe and product recommendations.",Health Care,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Under UpTech’s guidance, they reformed their company as GamiGen and rededicated theirselves to developing software that pushes all boundaries and limits.  Their first products focused on fire safety and situational awareness training.

As communications providers seek ways to compete more effectively and better leverage their infrastructure investments, additional pressure is brought to bear on telecom equipment vendors. The ability to deliver switching and transmission solutions that offer service providers increased flexibility and improved economics is the key to equipment providers’ success. ONEX Communications enables service providers to achieve service agility by providing telecom equipment vendors with the industry’s first System Silicon. ONEX Communications’ System Silicon gives established telecom equipment vendors the flexible migration path necessary for enabling existing products to support next-generation requirements. ONEX’s System Silicon also allows emerging telecom vendors to develop cutting edge carrier systems. System Silicon provides integrated switching, routing and transmission on silicon. Telecom equipment vendors realize unparalleled benefits by a reduction in cost, power, and space requirements to one tenth of existing piece-part solutions. Additionally, by enabling universal line cards and switch fabrics, ONEX Communications’ System Silicon reduces cost and system design complexity for its equipment vendor customers. Service providers also benefit with decreased operational costs and simplified provisioning. By implementing convergence at the component level, ONEX Communications’ System Silicon delivers dramatically improved design and development flexibility for telecom systems vendors. Accordingly, telecom systems vendors leveraging ONEX Communications System Silicon can deliver significant benefits to their service provider customers. For example, by enabling universal line cards and universal switching fabrics, service providers benefit from simplified provisioning, decreased inventory costs and flexible service migration for customers. ONEX Communications was honored with the prestigious ""private company to watch"" designation by the investment banking firm Robertson Stephens in its 2001 report on the Communications Semiconductor industry. IBM also selected ONEX Communications as the charter member of its ""Rising Star"" partner program. ONEX Communications is headquartered in Bedford, Massachusetts, within the heart of Massachusetts’ telecommunications corridor. ONEX Communications distributes its products through a direct sales force, and via a relationship with TranSwitch Corporation.
