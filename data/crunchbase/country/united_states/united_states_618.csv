Help your friends get a job, and make up to $4,000 per hire! Get yourself a job, and the money is yours! -> Companies: Have a Risk-Free, Faster, Better & Cost Effective Hiring! So, why finding and hiring quality people is so difficult? Well... because ANYONE can apply or be referred to a job opening! ANYONE! THERE’S NO FILTER! Too many people apply or refer someone to a job opening when there's not even a remote chance of even getting an interview. Only a fraction of all the candidates has a real fit with the openings. But organizations still have to go through all the candidates to find those talents and it’s taking them more than 52 days and $4,000 per hire to do that. And the cost of a bad hire is horrible! They lose $25,000 per bad hire, they have 41% less productivity, they lose 40% of time due to hiring and training a new worker, 36% negative impact on employee morale and 22% negative impact on client solutions. That’s why DoneHire exists! Donehire is the first job platform that motivates candidates and referrers to focus on quality and not quantity! How do we do it? First, whether the user is applying or providing a referral, if that ends up in a hiring she will make up to $4,000. Second, the user will have at least 20 tokens per month to use. 1 token is 1 referring action (including applications). Third, the user will have a reputation to manage. The more successful she is with her referrals/applications, the higher her reputation and so the bigger her rewards and more tokens per month. What’s our business model? We charge companies a fee per hire of less than $600.00. What's our market opportunity? Considering that on average there are 1.27 hires per opening and 8 million online openings per year in the US, our Total Addressable Market is bigger than $6 billion per year. We are live and running from June 1st! We have deep expertise and decades of combined experience in Human Resources, Technology, and Business Development.",Other,3,"Carlos Rohrer, Daiki Kohara, Prerna Sharma",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
