We present our client partners with deep, detailed information to give them actionable candidate insight, successfully completing some of the most complex searches on the planet to provide measurable recruiting results. For Clients For clients in think tanks, consulting, financial services and other corporate and government verticals, we work hand-in-hand to quantify staff needs requiring advanced educational credentials and expertise within specific information analysis, thought leadership, data marketing and sales. We then identify both obvious and newly discovered talent pools, source and recruit best-in-class talent from those constituencies, provide actionable candidate insights to hiring executives, and facilitate often complex recruiting and negotiation processes to bring top-performing experts to their organization. For Candidates For candidates we recruit coming from information analysis, we provide them with in-depth understanding of client opportunities and facilitate meaningfully detailed introductions for career-making positions they would likely have been unaware of, and in many cases not even realized their own fit for. We find and match professionals possessing uniquely advanced understanding of complex or massive information analysis – the people who analyze, who make or save money from, who write white papers about, who market and who sell “big data” – with the companies who need that level of intellectual firepower to meet their own mandates. Though our candidates will often have advanced technological understand and deep programming skills, they are not technology professionals – our candidates make sense and financial impact out of the data acquired by their counterparts in IT. Verticals Include Think Thank: monetary/economic, foreign, social, military and public policy analytics, thought leadership, sales and marketing. Consulting: valuation, impact, risk, governance, financial Financial Services: quantitative, risk, complex regulatory analysts. Consumer Products: behavioral analysis.
