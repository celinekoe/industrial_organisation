The target service is the burgeoning massage industry, an $11.8 billion sector with approximately 325,000 licensed providers and 39 million consumers, nationwide. Seventy (70%) of massage services are now performed without the benefit of a retail store or institutional location. Providers and consumers use ad-hoc methods of finding one another through word-of-mouth, thousands of micro websites, small scale networking, promotion and advertising. The disparate nature of both providers and consumers is begging for the organizational structure that Bliss will offer. Bliss will provide an organized and convenient way for providers and consumers to find each other, make and receive payments and insure quality. Bliss not only connects the network of providers and consumers but also virtually assures that consumers will find a qualified, licensed massage professional anywhere, anytime by bringing Uber-style participation to market.    The massage services sector is growing rapidly in conjunction with the aging US population and growing consumer awareness of the therapeutic benefits of massage. The convenience and robust networking capacity that Bliss offers has virtually no competition.

Founded in 1856 and incorporated in 1857 by an act of the state legislature, the Chicago Historical Society and its collection grew and opened its first building at the corner of Dearborn and Ontario Streets. That building and the most of the collection, however, burned during the Great Fire of 1871. After three years and a second fire that destroyed most of the remaining collection, the Society renewed its operations. Occupying temporary buildings on the same site until 1896, the organization built a massive stone edifice designed by Henry Ives Cobb, which housed the Gilpin Library and exhibition spaces. In 1920, the Society purchased thousands of manuscripts and hundreds of paintings and historical artifacts from the estate of Charles F. Gunther, including the bed on which Abraham Lincoln died and George Washington’s compass. In the late 1920s, the trustees began planning a new $1 million museum to house its growing collection and to celebrate the city’s centennial. Designed by Graham, Anderson, Probst & White, the Georgian colonial building opened in 1932 in Lincoln Park at Clark Street at North Avenue. That building, with various additions, renovations, and improvements, has served as the organization's home ever since. In 1972, the Society unveiled a modern limestone addition by Alfred Shaw and Associates.  In 1988, Holabird and Root ""wrapped"" the limestone addition in a red brick modern adaptation of the 1932 building and added underground storage and new gallery spaces. In February 2006, the Chicago Historical Society announced its new name: The Chicago History Museum. After renovating approximately 75 percent of its public space, the Museum now features a dramatic new lobby as well as new galleries and exhibitions and a redesigned Museum Store. Now celebrating its 150th anniversary, the Chicago History Museum continues to tell the stories of the city and its people through exhibitions, programs, publications, and a website. Its Research Center serves thousands of people each year, from schoolchildren working on History Fair projects to PhD students writing dissertations to filmmakers researching documentaries.","Information Technology, Other, Travel and Tourism",,,101-250,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
