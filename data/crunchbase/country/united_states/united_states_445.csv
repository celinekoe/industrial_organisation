Founded in March of 2013, Public Funds Investment & Reporting (PFITR, ) is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) technology company that enables those responsible for overseeing tax dollars to see valuation metrics based on market transactions to make the best investment decisions possible.   Treasurers, Directors of Finance, public CFOs—all are examples of public fiduciaries who oversee, cumulatively, trillions of dollars in their operational accounts.  State statutes and internal investment policies govern  the three mandates of  safety, liquidity, and yield.   Keeping the investments safe involves identifying, measuring and mitigating risk.    Liquidity is the second mandate and most entities keep an excess amount of cash and cash equivalents and because they lack the cash flow analytics required.   Buying too high, hidden commissions, and holding too much cash often sacrifice yield.   Our BPV™ tool provides them the analytics and internal controls to guide public fiduciaries to lessen  risk, commissions, and poor timing.  How do public fiduciaries, so burdened with conflicting demands and looming risks, respond? They either avoid doing anything or they take the advice of the bank or broker making the recommendation.   Many public fiduciaries lack the experience, technology and training to make optimal investment purchases, so they are dependent on the recommendations of the broker because most do not use  an advisor.   There is an inherent conflict of interest in many recommendations because, generally speaking, brokerages receive higher commissions when the product sold  is riskier  generally .  Most public fiduciaries are under-diversified, over-liquid and earning too little on their multi-million dollar portfolios. Cumulatively, public fiduciaries currently invest trillions of taxpayer dollars each year. In their flagship product, the Bond Price Validation tool (BPV™), PFITR provides public fiduciaries the information that they need to make optimal investment purchases. With proprietary, licensed data from strategic partners, including Moody’s, Interactive Data Corporation, CUSIP, and Standard & Poor’s, packaged into a user-friendly software interface, PFITR puts internal controls in place so that the public fiduciary  can make more informed decisions. . PFITR offers public fiduciaries market transparency for their investment purchases and inventories. Bond fees and commissions are not transparent and are rarely known.    The BPV™ tool is the most affordable and easy-to_use technology that lets public fiduciaries know market information about and pricing of investments before purchasing them`	.   In the world of public finance, proof is invaluable.  Constituents want proof that their public servants are doing a good job, and auditors demand it.  Bond Price Validation generates  instant reports for every transaction that a public fiduciary makes in comparison to comparable market transactions. With Bond Price Validation, constituents and auditors alike are able to view and understand exactly why public fiduciaries make the investments that they do. PFITR has earned the attention of two early stage venture investors. Capital Innovators, the Missouri Technology Corporation and SixThirty are among a few of those who have cumulatively invested PFITR. In recent months, PFITR has built an impressive sales pipeline, with almost 100 product demos currently scheduled and a projected annual recurring revenue strea(ARR) of more than $300k by January 2016.  Together, these factors contribute to PFITR’s current valuation of $3.8MM.  Accordingly, PFITR seeks $380k for a 10% stake in the company. With a total market size of 116,000 U.S. public entities, PFITR aims to convert 4,000 public entities to customers within five years.  This market penetration rate of about 3.5% requires PFITR to convert three customers in the month of September 2015 and post consistent, month-over-month sales growth of about 15% through 2017, at which time growth may slow to a more mature rate of 6%. Less than four months into their sales efforts and with only one full-time Sales Development Representative (SDR) and one Account Executive (AE), PFITR has already converted four new customers in September 2015.  At 4,000 customers, PFITR will achieve a valuation of more than $625MM.","Data and Analytics, Software",1,Jim Koetting,1-10,8,Seed,511000,USD,511000,736000,USD,736000,"SixThirty, FIS, UMB Banks, Capital Innovators, Missouri Technology Corporation",,11,,Private,,,,,,

Three Tree Ventures prefers to invest in startups as early as possible, exclusively invests in product companies, and prefers to invest in organizations with one or more U.S. military veteran founder(s), and/or women and minority-founded startups.  Mr. Carpenter is a globally respected cyber security expert with a broad range of successful early-stage investments, including Compass (04/01/2021 IPO NYSE:COMP @ $8.22B valuation), GroupSense, White Ops (acquired by Goldman Sachs Merchant Banking), Dark Cubed, uSTADIUM, PeerNova, MILLIE, Rumi Spice, Awake Security (acquired by Arista Networks), Privateer Holdings (acquired by TILRAY), ThreatGRID (acquired by Cisco Systems), RideScout (acquired by Daimler AG), InAuth (acquired by American Express) and Efflux Systems (acquired by NETSCOUT Systems). Mr. Carpenter is known for his acumen for advising early stage innovators. He has successfully helped raise capital, navigate rough waters, acquire key talent and customers, and help develop short and long-term strategies for portfolio companies and startups that he advises. He is currently an Advisor to CrossCut Ventures, Trinity Cyber, TruSTAR Technology (acquired by Splunk), GroupSense, uSTADIUM, MILLIE, Cannecht, and Netswitch Technology Management. He has also been a Limited Partner at CrossCut Ventures for 7+ years, and is also a CrossCut Scout. He has held key positions at startups where he was an early employee — Principal Forensics Analyst at NetWitness Corporation (acquired by EMC/RSA), Chief Technical Analyst at iSIGHT Partners (acquired by FireEye), Chief Strategy Officer at Invotas (aquired by FireEye), and Senior Vice President of Cyber at Cybraics. One of his greatest passions is being the Technical Advisor for a non-profit 501(c)3 founded by his wife, Dr. Jennifer Jacobs, and a close friend, Jessica Stern — Connect Our Kids (https://www.connectourkids.org). The non-profit is applying modern technologies like artificial intelligence and data science to the foster care system in the United States to improve placement outcomes -- finding forever families for thousands of children in the system.  His experience and successful entrepreneurial background are coupled with deep technical skills honed while pioneering cyber security protocols for the federal government and working at NetWitness and iSIGHT Partners over the past two decades. Shawn is also a veteran of the U.S. Navy, and qualified as a nuclear operator and chemist during his six years of service in the U.S. Navy's Nuclear Propulsion Program (NNPS Class 9203). Shawn also worked as a senior cyber security analyst for almost six years as a Member of the Technical Staff (MTS) at Sandia National Laboratories. He discovered one of the first documented penetrations of U.S. Government networks. After joining NetWitness as one of the first employees, he helped architect, implement and stand up the Justice Security Operations Center (JSOC) — at the time the largest deployment of NetWitness gear for a federal client. Mr. Carpenter also worked as a Principal Senior Analyst at the U.S. Department of State's Cyber Threat Analysis Team (CTAD) from 2004-2007. He was a key member of the 2005 CTAD team that was awarded the prestigious Frank B. Rowlett Trophy For Organizational Achievement by the National Security Agency (https://apps.nsa.gov/iaarchive/programs/rowlett-awards/recipients.cfm).  Mr. Carpenter has been tinkering with computers since his mother bought him his first computer, a TRS-80 Model I, in late 1978 at the age of 10 . He has been curious about almost everything since he was born, and enjoys playing slide guitar, harmonica, banjo and trumpet, metal detecting with his kids, building forts high in tall trees, lucid dreaming, experimenting with brain/machine interfaces, building robotics projects with his kids, and hacking all of the things. Mr. Carpenter has a particular affection for blues and jazz, and is an investor and Minor Partner in a John Coltrane biography — ""Chasing Trane"" (https://www.coltranefilm.com). His investments span everything from being the first money in at Rumi Spice (https://www.rumispice.com), a sustainable saffron growing enterprise founded by three West Point graduates, to PeerNova, a blockchain startup founded by his CS251 instructor from University of Nebraska. Five years after investing in Rumi Spice, it is now the largest private employer of Afghan women in the world, with over 2000 women employees. In May 2017, Mark Cuban became an investor in the saffron startup. In September of 2018, Rumi Spice's saffron became available nationwide in all Whole Food Markets.  Shawn is a native of Sioux Falls, SD, and credits his Mother, Jan, high school marching band instructor, David Haugen, South Dakota roots, and industry mentors and friends like Aaron Walters, Jaci Tomek, Amit Yoran, Dug Song, Gary Golomb, Chris Lukas, Sean Catlett, Richard Stiennon, Paul Garrett, Fraser Verrusio, and many others for his scrappiness and successes.","Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Community and Lifestyle, Financial Services, Food and Beverage, Health Care, Information Technology, Internet Services, Other, Real Estate, Science and Engineering",1,Shawn Carpenter,1-10,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,Shawn Carpenter,1,1,,Private,,,,,,

The food truck industry has gained significant momentum over the past 5 years, growing from an estimated $650 Million in revenue in 2012 to an estimated $5.9 Billion in 2017. And yet, food truck owners and operators are challenged with balancing demand and supply to achieve profitability. Inspired by Co-Founder Ray Chow, two long-term foodies and an experienced restaurant and food truck owner came together to help solve the drive, park and pray challenge and create a platform that connects the world’s mobile food industry. Our mission is simple: to amplify food truck operations utilizing technology, predictive analytics and IoT on a food truck. By connecting what we believe are 10 unique customer segments into a robust ecosystem, Foosye® will offer an industry-wide platform that enables communication, scalable and repeatable processes and ultimately profitability for this growing industry segment. Foosye® is much more than a technology – it is a platform that connects the mobile food industry.  In 2015, Foosye® filed a patent for our platform technology and processes. Our patent is bigger than just the mobile food industry, and supports all mobile retail. Given the popularity and continued growth of the food industry, mobile food trucks are our primary market entrance. Long-term, the Foosye® platform will be used to enable other mobile vendors, including mobile clothing retailers, pop-up markets, etc. The food truck industry is more robust and dynamic than meets the eye. Ten unique customer segments not only influence and effect the industry, but also represent revenue streams for the Foosye® platform. These segments include: Food Truck Owners		General Public			Advertisers Event Coordinators		Vendors/Suppliers		Commissaries Trade Associations		Government			Municipalities 	 Food Truck Parks & Lots				 Contrary to common misconception, all food trucks are not the same. Each is unique in its capacity to balance marketing and operating a business while taking care of the paying customer at the window. Event coordinators and consumers are also key constituents in the mobile food community; without these there is no demand for the trucks. Foosye® solves this challenge by offering an industry-wide, data-driven platform that allows mobile food truck owners to focus on the customer at the window while leveraging predictive analytics and simple dashboards to make better decisions on when and where to operate their trucks. The Foosye® platform simultaneously allows event coordinators and consumers to engage directly with food trucks. In an increasing mobile society connected via social technologies, the mobile food truck industry is poised to dominate consumer interest over the next 3 to 5 years. By combining a wide variety of dining selections, in a convenient way, that feeds the experiences that today’s consumers value, the food truck industry will only continue to grow and expand. Foosye® is uniquely positioned as THE platform connecting the mobile food supply chain, eliminating “drive, park and pray” for vendors and “where’s lunch?” for consumers.

Good government cannot be created from within, it should and must be developed by colonels much like most civil governments began. Our company (a cooperative of commissioned colonels) is a Creative Commons Workgroup all of our work is based on publishing books, news articles and website publications. Since 1998 we have become experts on the use of formal Colonial English speech and writing in order to properly analyze the historical record to disambiguate the Real Kentucky Colonel from the one of make believe, fantasy and fiction. We do not create Kentucky colonels, but we do help make Kentucky colonels the men and women they should be as our social leaders and goodwill ambassadors!  Our workgroup is responsible for the structural development of a viable historical record and to distinguish the colonels from books, movies and tv from the Real Kentucky Colonel dating back to the very first colonel that builds the Wilderness Road in March of 1775 with 100 men and their families. The very real and untold story (that very few people know) is powerful and worthwhile for the big screen as well as a book leading up to present day Kentucky featuring an entire series of scenes with more highlights than downfalls. The entire story has never been told about the origins of Kentucky or the colonel's role in creating it. As a creative group we understand that the content is potentially viable intellectual property based on the popularity of the Kentucky Colonel Title and the Kentucky Colonel Name which we are authorized as a collective group to license under our common-law trademark rights, and trade name rights in letters patent, in various forms such as ""Kentucky Colonel + ___________"" or by Col. _______  ________ , Kentucky Colonel. We are at the disposal of multiple brands and marketing companies to develop the common-law trademark rights into their themed products. Currently we are working with other colonels to develop new licensed brands, ideas and nicknames for classical relative products originated in the Commonwealth prior to its establishment as a state. Soon the Transylvania Company will introduce Kentucky Colonel Beer, the Kentucky Colonel Quarter Horses, Kentucky Colonel Cannabis, Kentucky Colonel Carbon Credits, Kentucky Colonel Cash Cryptocurrency and an official Kentucky Colonel ID Card which is an international work credential. As a cooperative workgroup we require an investment of $10,000 with a 10% good-faith deposit waiver ($1,000) to get into the cooperative and sign the NDA. Other work assimilation programs are under development for 2023; now that we have a good working platform and a low liability high potential investment structure. Any investor that is not a Kentucky Colonel now will become one by investing in this Kentucky business! These investors are the potential protagonists. A Kentucky Colonel can however; become a single share or partial share investor by joining the cooperative and working as a Kentucky Colonel. There are obviously a lot of terms and ideas that are based on intellectual property laws that the Kentucky Colonel may own or the Commonwealth of Virginia, however senseless there is practically nothing invented in Kentucky that the colonel does not have jurisdiction. The addition of the Honorable Title to a newspaper article does not make it as popular as it does rare for all the right reasons.","Content and Publishing, Information Technology, Media and Entertainment, Professional Services",3,"David Wright, Godfrey Brock-Gadd, Luis Cruz-Diaz",51-100,1,,7500,USD,7500,7500,USD,7500,,,,,Private,,,,,,
