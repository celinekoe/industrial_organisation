The CGMA is designed to elevate management accounting and further emphasise its importance for businesses worldwide. The CGMA recognises the unique role played by management accountants in businesses around the world who are guiding critical business decisions and driving strong business performance. It sets a new standard for global recognition of management accounting by building on the longstanding foundations and thought leadership of the AICPA and CIMA. United by global quality standards for ethics and performance, the CGMA maintains distinct credibility and positioning among worldwide business designations. Through a wide range of resources and learning opportunities, the designation further elevates CGMAs’ management accounting expertise, skills, ethical standards, commitment and dedication. CIMA and AICPA members are already at the heart of major private and public sector organisations around the world. The CGMA showcases their commitment to helping organisations understand and integrate financial and non-financial information across multiple functions, so the business can maintain growth and perform more efficiently. CGMAs may work in finance, or may put their broader business training to use across the organisation, often in the roles of Board Director, Chairman, CEO or CFO. The CGMA will quickly become part of the business vernacular, offering management accountants exciting new roles that research shows us key business decision-makers are looking to fill. Those holding the CGMA will be acknowledged as trusted business strategists who can connect the dots between financial fundamentals and physical assets and a broad array of performance factors. The AICPA and CIMA are committed to promoting the important work CGMAs do on behalf of businesses.
