On their catering side, they have signed up with three companies and also do private catering, and they will do anything the client needs, with or without the truck. They do weddings, corporate events, festivals and they are often booked daily for doubles on the food truck with a corporate drop off catering on the side. The business has grown so fast and I have been working to pay off the food truck and now it is PIF but in the meantime I took equity loans on the business. I am working on getting an SBA loan now that I own the foodtruck, but in the meantime would love to be able to fund the personal and COG required to continue the growth. The SBA loan would pay off any other loans that I have and my SBA lenders are extremely positive, it's just a timely process. Whatever I might get from EquityNet would go to pay off loans as well and feed the operating capital until the SBA loan comes in. At this point their growth has been (100% in the last two months). I am a biochemist with an MBA and I love to cook, published in Sunset Magazine, and have a full time software sales position. Their food truck ROCKS!! They've been voted one of the top 10 in the Bay Area and recently I was on a speakers panel for food truck start ups. I know this business now inside and out and they have their stride on. I'm looking for investors who know a good deal when they see it and want to be paid back within the next 6-12 months if not sooner when the SBA loan comes in.","Food and Beverage, Travel and Tourism",,,1-10,1,,,,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The Legend Of Zelda games feature a mixture of action, puzzles, adventure/battle gameplay, exploration, and questing. These elements have remained constant throughout the series, but with refinements and additions featured in each new game. Later games in the series also comprise stealth gameplay, where the player must avoid enemies while proceeding through a level, as well as racing elements. Although the games can be beaten with a minimal amount of exploration and side quests, the player is frequently rewarded for solving puzzles or exploring hidden areas with helpful items or increased abilities. Some items are consistent and appear many times throughout the series, such as bombs, which can be used both as weapons and to open blocked or hidden doorways, boomerangs, which can kill or paralyze enemies, keys for locked doors, magic swords, shields, and bows and arrows, while others are unique to a single game. Though the games contain many role-playing elements (Zelda II was also the only one to include an experience system), they emphasise straightforward hack and slash-style combat over the strategic, turn-based or active time combat of games like Final Fantasy. The game's role-playing elements, however, have led to much debate over whether or not the Zelda games should be classified as action role-playing games, a genre on which the series had a strong influence.",Gaming,2,"Elliott Carlson, Samwoo Ee",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
