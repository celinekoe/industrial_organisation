There are a variety of mobile podcasting services out there Podlinez and Fonpods (deadpool) are two we've covered. However, these services have emphasized backwards compatibility by playing podcasts on specific phone numbers. Instead, Buzzwire relies on your dataplan, playing lists of media through your mobile browser. Creation and management of these play lists can be handled through their (somewhat ugly) website on your desktop browser. You can either add in content from their library of exiting podcasts to lists or upload your own. It works well on my iPhone, playing audio and video through the Quicktime player.","Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Mobile",,,11-50,2,Early Stage Venture,12000000,USD,12000000,12000000,USD,12000000,"Matrix, Spark Capital, Sequel Venture Partners",2,3,,Private,,,,,,

Any one of these issues can lead to scope creep, missed deadlines, and budget overruns. At Unstoppable Software, we design and develop custom software that works. Our clients range from tech startups to Fortune 100 corporations — everything from a regional healthcare organization to one of the world’s largest elevator manufacturers.
