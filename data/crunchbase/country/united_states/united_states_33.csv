This innovation will provide a softer, more powdery snow surface in contrast to the standard corduroy that has been the norm in the ski industry since the 1980’s. The flagship technology for the EcoGroomer brand, due later in 2014/2015, is an integrated snow grooming system that allows a single operator to cover up to 200% greater surface area with an extra-wide grooming path. This technology provides a tremendous productivity improvement in the field of snow grooming. Overall fuel efficiency will be improved by more than 35% and total slope grooming expenses will be reduced significantly at major resorts with this much anticipated new technology.","Manufacturing, Sports",1,Daniel Osborne,1-10,1,Seed,295000,USD,295000,295000,USD,295000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

If you are like most companies, the success of your business depends on technology wholly, or to a large extent.  You need a client focused team that can relate to you on a business level, and fully understand your business and what you are trying to accomplish.  You also need a team that is intimately familiar with the latest technology and can design and implement cost effective solutions to meet the short and long-term needs of your business.  This is part of the Intellectual Capital that RoseBud will bring to your business. RoseBud Technologies helps clients get more from their technology investment. Frequently when they begin working with a client they hear the comment  “it just doesn’t feel right.  It doesn’t seem like I’m getting what I thought I was going to get from my technology investment.”  They work with a client to “ask the right question” and “get the right answer” for their business. As a result their clients can focus on their business – not their technology. They often help a client create and maintain the technology infrastructure for their business. This infrastructure consists of desktops, servers, cloud based solutions plus other hardware and appropriate software products from a variety of technology vendors.  In doing this they do not “partner” with any particular hardware or software vendor – their partner is their client.  This infrastructure is used as the technology platform that allows their client to meet its business objectives and serve its customers. Their role is to be a pro-active member of the client team providing technology capability for the business. Their focus is on building and sustaining a client-centric relationship not on selling and completing a project. This focus on the client has allowed us to become a “partner” and “trusted advisor” to their clients which enables us to add real value to their business through technology.","Data and Analytics, Professional Services, Sales and Marketing",1,Joe Treanor,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
