This will aid cities in reducing the amount of cell phone use while driving and improve community, driver, and pedestrian safety. Our company works closely with local law enforcement and county traffic courts and we provide them with everything needed to efficiently issue tickets and enforce them.   Our primary business focus is increasing road safety by ONLY allowing and accepting videos to be submitted by passengers and pedestrians. Our app’s technology automatically tracks the user’s location, time, date, route and other necessary information needed to issue and enforce tickets. Once the user records the violation (a video clip of the violation and the violator's license plate) it is encrypted and sent securely to our servers where it is digitally signed to prevent tampering. Videos are reviewed and the ticket can be issued once approved by local law enforcement.   In summary, Government App Solutions is the first application and technology platform of its kind. We are the only provider of such a product and we are committed to reducing the prevalence of distracted driving.

Most recently, he has been working in the trenches of the Web 2.0 world with the successful marketing of his last venture, Get Vendors, which was acquired by Match Point, a division of Connexus Corp. NextBee’s business started as a solution rather than as a formal business plan. After talking with fellow Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, our founding team realized that although the latest ideas for web start-ups have different target audiences as well as different products, they share similar marketing tactics. While developing the best new marketing tools for our new start-up, we realized that we were building as a solution that would be useful for a variety of other businesses as well. We had stumbled upon our next adventure! We had the product, we had the marketing structure - we formalized the business model and NextBee got started. During the transformation from the initial stand-alone solution to the current feature rich platform, we did not change the core product features or the type of campaign we wanted our platform to support, but only expanded the scope and user-friendliness of our modules to accommodate the business needs of all our clients. Fast forward a few years: today NextBee is the leading marketing promotions platform for businesses with a social–media-savvy audience.  As a bootstrapped and profitable company with relentless focus on organic growth, we have never sponsored a conference nor run a jazzy ad campaign. Instead, we’ve single-mindedly focused on one thing, and only one thing: the results that we deliver to our customers. Needless to say, this is possible because of the extraordinary commitment from each of our employees, and so we are proud to say that our biggest asset is our dedicated team.  We intend to continually pull in new members who are as passionate about customer satisfaction as our current team members, and in the next few years we plan to establish ourselves as the Swiss Army Knife of customer engagement solutions for businesses of all sizes.","Advertising, Information Technology, Sales and Marketing, Software",1,Ashish Mohole,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Book has amassed invaluable and distinctive insights into Florida politics due to his active involvement in various statewide political campaigns. These campaigns encompass gubernatorial races, cabinet-level endeavors, and crucial referendums. Significantly, he was pivotal in the ""Five for Florida's Future"" campaign during the 1980s. Furthermore, his contributions extended to his engagement with two referendums in 2004 and 2008, instrumental in the legalization of gaming within Florida's pari-mutuel facilities. Beyond his prowess in lobbying, he and the accomplished team at the company extend their expertise to offer comprehensive consulting services tailored to a diverse range of businesses, spanning both burgeoning and well-established industries. These services encompass strategic planning, business development, and adept navigation through complex regulatory landscapes. Leveraging his extensive network of relationships with past and present elected officials and business leaders, he ensures that each client benefits from the most astute guidance available. His commitment to community service is commendable, as evidenced by his dedicated involvement with various charitable associations across the state. He has served on philanthropic boards such as Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital, Best Buddies, and the Mourning Family Foundation. Presently, he holds the esteemed position of chairing the Miami Dade Homeless Trust, a role he has maintained for over two decades. Collaborating with fellow members, including his initial appointment by Mayor Alex Penelas and numerous re-appointments, the company and his peers oversee a substantial budget, driving Miami Dade County's efforts to combat homelessness in the region. Under his guidance, the Trust has garnered repeated recognition as a national best-practice model. Recently, the Trust was honored to host HUD Secretary Ben Carson, marking its distinction as one of the first in the U.S. to declare an end to Military Veteran homelessness in both Miami-Dade County and the South Florida region. His leadership extends to his role as Co-founder and Board Chairman of the nonprofit Lauren's Kids Foundation. This charitable organization, established alongside his daughter, Florida State Senator Lauren, concentrates on eradicating childhood sexual abuse through education, awareness, and support for survivors and vulnerable children. Additionally, the Foundation seeks to positively impact families, children, and society through sexual abuse education and prevention. Presently, the Foundation's in-school curricula are adopted in more than 90,000 classrooms nationwide, a testament to their enduring influence. His educational journey is equally remarkable. He earned his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from Tulane University and his Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in Political Science from Florida International University. His academic journey includes his time as a track athlete for the Florida Gators from 1971 to 1973 while attending the University of Florida. As a registered lobbyist and esteemed member of the Florida Association of Professional Lobbyists (FAPL) and the Florida Bar, he continues to channel his expertise to catalyze positive change within law, policy, and public service.","Government and Military, Professional Services",1,Ron Book,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
