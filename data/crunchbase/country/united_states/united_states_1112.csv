These messages from  your customers, fans and critics spread quickly and have a large influence on their peers and if your brand doesn’t have a social media presence, you are handcuffing your ability to be a part of this conversation. At BuzzMgr, we believe that a successful social media strategy consists of the following four-step process: Find, Listen, Engage, and Lead. At each step in the process, measurement and data analysis are of utmost importance to track your progress and measure success. 1. Find The process begins by finding out who the influencers are in your target audience. Who are your biggest supporters, who are your biggest critics, and who could you potentially empower to become an ambassador of your brand? 2. Listen Once you found who the influencers are, the next step is to listen to what they’re saying. What is it that they are passionate about? What motivates them? A lot of folks are so ready to get into social media that they skip this step, but your findings here will set the foundation for our next step. 3. Engage You know who your influencers are and what they’re passionate about, so now it’s time to strike up a conversation with them. Let them know that you’re listening and you’re just as passionate about their interests as they are. This step will help build a level of trust between the consumer and your brand. 4. Lead This step shouldn’t be about persuading your audience to do something. It should be about empowering them to take action that acts as an outlet to express what they’re passionate about. This may be purchasing your product or posting a video relevant to your brand, but it all comes down to inspiring your audience to take some sort of action","Internet Services, Media and Entertainment",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Given that Methane Gas is the primary component of natural gas and is a potent greenhouse gas, reducing methane emissions can result in environmental, economic and operational benefits. Four continuously evolving factors are driving the necessity for leak detection services to the Oil & Gas Industry, and in turn will ultimately drive the success of VGI. 1. Emerging Infrared Technology- Allows previously invisible and undetected gases to be """"seen"""" and recorded escaping from components at the wellhead and      throughout processing. 2. Safety- The leaking gas is highly combustible posing considerable risk to personnel. 3. Economics- Due to the corrosive nature of minerals coming straight from the earth, it is not a matter of """"if"""" a leak develops, but """"when""""! The escaping gas can be quantified and a dollar amount applied that offsets  the costs of VGI's services. 4. Recent studies, rulings and regulatory guidelines are ongoingly being implemented to measure and regulate the amount of greenhouse gases being released by Oil and Gas Operators. Secondly, they give the EPA the ability to use the same Infrared Technology to detect leaks resulting in citations and monetary fines.

Technology has created a digitally connected America that is changing everything. It's a channel for Policing that has never before existed, and, until iWatch™, was unreachable and unknown. iWatch™ Mobile is all the public needs to join Law Enforcement in fighting crime. Regardless of handset, carrier or language, anyone can use iWatch™. The public can submit tips anonymously, or with full disclosure. Add images or video to a tip from almost any smartphone or any PC. The Admin can reject or accept the tip and forward it to a specific officer for follow-up. Once accepted they can send both the tip & the images or video to an alerting group for investigation in less than 4 clicks. What makes iWatch™ different? It's very simple: iWatch™ is a complete suite of services that can replace old school, low-tech systems that don't integrate to CAD, dispatch, provide reverse 911, offer video monitoring or social networking tools. Instead of multiple systems, each with a separate cost, it's own app, or tip line or dashboard, iWatch pulls it all together seamlessly into a easy to use, but massively powerful networked application. Think about how old word processing programs evolved to become Microsoft Office Suite and how televisions have become home entertainment centers with satellite and internet connections. iWatch™ is that evolution. With iWatch™, law enforcement can link information (rewards, tip lines, video, photos, sketches, etc.) with offense reports, and publish alerts, warnings, maps, and other information to selected audiences (other agencies, specific law enforcement officers, the general public, news media, and Crime Watch associations or other groups). iWatch™ tips may be new, or received as tips from prior offenses by clicking on the offense in a map. Mapping the tips permits forwarding of the tip to the appropriate agency, precinct or investigative resource. In the backend, the dashboard console makes it simple to approve and publish information for investigation or dispatch. iWatch™ permits information (rewards, tip lines, video, photos, sketches, etc.) to be linked with offense reports. The iWatch Suite of Applications from iThinQware has been developed to fulfill the technological challenges of Community Policing in today's always on, always connected world. Regardless of handset, carrier or language, iWatch gives Law Enforcement the most cost efficient means of gaining Human Intelligence.With smartphones now used by 40% of the population, the mobile handset and the dashboard in iWatch lets you gain that contact with the community, get the information you need, and assign the resources as efficiently as possible. Click to View Tip FlowChart All tips, regardless of the source, are 100% anonymous. Users can submit both new tips and tips that are related to prior offenses. The law enforcement only dashboard uses powerful, built-in geo fences to show where, when and to which agency, division or department a tip is assigned. Officers can subsequently respond to tipsters in a real-time, anonymous two-way text chat using any of 32 languages. Press conferences, press releases, public statements, and tips issued through the news media are still powerful tools – but they are not sufficient in today's interconnected, Internet enabled world. iWatch™ is a 21st century community policing suite, or ""Community Policing 2.0,"" as it's been called. The system is simple and elegant. Far more than ""just a form,"" the mobile app allows users to submit text only tips, free form tips with images and videos, or voice tips. ""We decided that the only thing missing in the 'See Something, Say Something' program was the mobile phone in the palm of your hand. Until we invented the iWatch™ application, no citizen could say something with enough immediacy or with the precise detail that a Fusion center or could fully benefit from having,"" said Dan Elliott. ""We made it work where no other application could, and the proof is in the tips"". Cities everywhere are being increasingly challenged by the need to send immediate notifications to citizens. iTAG is a powerful solution to this growing problem. As an extension of the iWatch™ Suite of Mobile applications, iTAG is a low-cost, high-impact toolset allowing citizens to receive alerts as text, emails, with simple formatting, html, images and video. Public Users may subscribe, or professionals may be be ""invited"" to single groups or multiple task forces. Users are then mapped and displayed in a searchable database deliverable to handsets or websites for the public, departmental or interagency sharing and collaboration. You control the message, you control the categorie of the message, you control the delivery of the message and who is authorized to receive it. ‘Community policing 2.0’ might only be a catch-phrase but it highlights how this technology has put the power back with the people for greater safety and closer relations with public safety officers. The smart phone app has made an impact. The criminals can’t hide anymore.",Mobile,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Based on that we have built a platform that enable businesses to better attract and keep their customers not through discounts and special deals but through their level of commitment to their customers' community. Instead of giving away heavy discounts and frequent special deals, we enable businesses to channel some of that money towards the whole community by pledging donations and allowing their customers to vote on what non-profits should receive that money in exchange of their support. The idea is simple, you accumulate points from your local business (by buying products, checking in, answering surveys, etc..) and in return that business would convert those points to donation money to the causes that you choose. Businesses would be able to track the donations and learn about their customers social interests. Businesses can also connect with their customers through surveys and special offers that are tailored around their level of social commitment so when customers get that 15% discount it will be in recognition of their support for a good cause. The platform can also transform into a true social game the impact of which can be seen and felt in real life and on real communities. Consumers get to finally see and feel what impact they are having on their local community by tracking how many points they have donated to the causes they want to support and by having visibility over what businesses are being socially engaged. We also believe that no good deed should go unnoticed and that is why our users who donate the most number of points will be highlighted on our Top Donors so they get to compete to be the top donor in the city and bring awareness and support to their causes. There's more, non-Profits are businesses with customers (donors) of their own so we enable them to recognize those customers (donors) for their support and to connect with the community at large to gain exposure and garner needed support from community members. If you support a non-profit organization then you can ""Endorse"" it to show your friends what causes you are passionate and you can actually ""Salute"" your favorite non-profit organization to give them moral support and to encourage your friends to follow suit. Businesses would grow by engaging their customers on social responsibility, consumers would have an easy and fun way to be engaged in and support their local communities, and charities would get the exposure and the funds they need to support their efforts. Responsible City is where you can shop for a good cause and where social responsibility turns into social status.","Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Sales and Marketing",,,1-10,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Since World War II, when people become permanently spinal cord injured (regardless of their age), and are not able to return to their homes because of inaccessibility issues, they are then placed in nursing homes. This solution not only alienates the young disabled person from living in the community, it is also extremely costly (up to $15,000 per month). Their ultimate goal is to reunite persons with spinal cord injury and other disabilities with the community by creating permanent and accessible supportive housing.  Wheels of Progress has a solution to the institutionalization of young persons with spinal cord injury and other disabilities. The organization has fashioned an innovative approach to supportive housing for physically disabled individuals ages 13-64. Wheels of Progress will combine apartment-style housing with personal care and services and, as a result, residents will be able to live independently with dignity and will enjoy the freedom of community living as opposed to being institutionalized.  Wheels of Progress envisions a world in which young people with spinal cord injuries and other physical disabilities are no longer prisoners in nursing homes, in their homes, or in their minds but instead are able to develop the will and the skill to embrace their new reality and to reinvent their lives. Our mission is to create permanent, accessible supportive housing and to provide transformative environments, education, and experiences for persons with spinal cord injuries or other physical disabilities.","Health Care, Other, Social Impact",1,George Gallego,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
