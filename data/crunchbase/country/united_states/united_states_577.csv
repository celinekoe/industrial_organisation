George S. Patton We believe today's patent wars are no different- we are just building the new era of weapons! Search and analysis of large datasets has been a recurrent problem approached by different groups in different ways: most rely on keyword search and statistical analytics. The USTPOs public dataset on US/International patents applications and grants has been approached in similar ways, and yet it has yet to be fully utilized. This neglect is linked to the datas poorly tailored structure for keyword search algorithms. The most notable example is Google Patents, where the hardships are evident in the attempt to implement keyword frequency analysis to streamline patent exploration. This niche space requires a disruptive concept that could cause a paradigm shift in the execution and visualization of search in conceptually linked data groups. There exists a tangible market need to simplify and streamline patent searching and novelty exploration, especially infringement detection. This encompasses the simplification of patent filing, comparison and retrieval both for private/judicial and government agencies as well as a means for industry to interact with inventors or consulting firms to research future technological developments. By building a visualization and search engine centered around non keyword based algorithms (our secret sauce - patent pending), we allow users to overcome the problems faced by competitor approaches and enhance their search experience.

The future of healthcare will be challenging. In today’s economic climate, healthcare reform and proposed changes in Medicare reimbursement make it critical that hospitals take steps now to increase efficiency, reduce expenses and maintain a steady cash flow. The revenue cycle is the core process that converts care to cash. Your financial viability relies on your ability to obtain accurate reimbursement for services delivered. Superior Revenue Solutions is prepared to help you reach your highest potential through comprehensive end-to-end Revenue Cycle Optimization focused on process redesign, organization design, and performance management through personalized solutions and sound guidance for implementing those solutions.  However, unlike many firms, they do this work while respecting current organizational culture and talent. We understand and appreciate the uniqueness of each hospital or physician practice regardless of size. Their goal is simple:  Superior Revenue Solutions wants to assist you in reaching your highest potential - that ""next level"" of excellence and sustainability. Superior Revenue Solutions can help you assess your current revenue cycle operations and focus on ways to optimize charge capture and revenue collection. Problems rarely stem from a single source; they are most often the result of deficiencies in education, training, staffing levels, workflow, or poorly implemented computer software. Each deficiency must be addressed as part of a coordinated solution to obtain real improvement.","Health Care, Information Technology, Professional Services",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

SignTurbine is engaged in the design of the FlagTurbine, which is a vertical wind turbine that provides advertising and electricity generation. It is interfaced into the SignTurbine Power Generation Management System to form an efficiency management network of load demand power management and distribution. The primary focus is to develop the foundation for clean charging of electric cars located in the parking lots. This target is first directed toward automotive dealerships to impact the transition of their product and provide the direction for additional business integration such as Banks, Universities, Restaurants, Retail, etc.... One quarter of the world electricity is consumed by lighting. By impacting power generation, lighting consumption and utilization management, SignTurbine can progressively impact the transition to energy independence.  Flag poles and light poles are underutilized and SignTurbine uses this existing structural and electrical wiring foundation to minimize overall cost in creating power generation management systems. America’s over 4 million parking lots can become power generation systems that promote the Green Energy of Advertising. Converting the single usage concept of powering lights in parking lots, into a controlled bi-directional process of power generation, distribution and load management, turns consumption into manufacturing, utilizing existing foundations. The 4 million parking lots that consume an estimated 200 TWh annually can become 2 PWh electricity manufacture.","Advertising, Energy, Sales and Marketing, Sustainability",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
