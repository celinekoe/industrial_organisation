Practice Visual started out in 1999 as an IT support provider and custom software & systems solutions for Specialty Dentists and Orthodontists. In collaboration with several multi-location Specialty Dental and Orthodontic Practices around Chicago, we started the development of a new dental software platform in 2007 to address the shortcomings and enhancement opportunities gathered from supporting our competitors'​ products. Initially released in 2014 and currently at its 6th major release, Visual Practice is still the only cloud-based product in this market optimized for touch with Mac / Windows / Web Browser clients, 2D / 3D imaging, fast broadband mobility, and built-in patient engagement, social media reviews & marketing automation while still retaining the full power and the rich feature set of our more traditional Client-Server competitors such as Dolphin, Wave Ortho / OrthoEase, topsOrtho / topsCephMate, Dentrix, Eagle Soft, Open Dental, Mogo, XL-Dent, and OaSYS / Crossfire.","Data and Analytics, Health Care, Information Technology, Internet Services, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
