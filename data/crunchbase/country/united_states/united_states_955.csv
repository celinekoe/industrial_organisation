Digg and many other social news sites do a reasonable to good job of displaying the most popular news articles of the day, but what they do best is uncover the most interesting content rather than the most read.An algorithm-based measuring system analyzes readers' behavior in real time to generate Spotplex's popular content rankings.

This impartial process gives every blogger a fair opportunity to be heard.

Trippett founded the General Finance Company, which later became the General American Finance System. In the summer of 1936 Meadows, Peters and Trippett united with J. W. Gilliland, a petroleum expert, to form the General American Oil Company. Meadows became the president and major stockholder of the General American Oil Company in 1941 and was elected chairman of the board in 1950. By 1959 the company had acquired 2,990 oil wells in fifteen states and Canada and was drilling for oil in Spain. Richard Rainwater became a partner in the company in 1969, as did Howard Hughes. In 1971, Peters acquired a minority stake in Howard Hughes' Hughes Tool Company, to which was later sold in 1972. In 1983, Meadows, Trippett, and Peters' son, Eric Woods, sold General American Oil Company to Phillips Petroleum. After Peters passed away in 1981, Woods would go on to manage the family business and consolidated much of the family’s assets to renewable energy infrastructure in Texas. Today, Woods Family Investments is the asset manager for Woods Family Office's alternative investments, equities, fixed income, currencies, commodities and structured products.

While developing a software product for children, Mark Smith, BrowseSafe CEO, and several programmers began following companies who were coming to market with products to protect children and their families from objectionable content on the Internet. After some preliminary research, it became apparent that a safe way of browsing the Internet did not exist in the commercial marketplace. There were, and currently are, several blocking and filtering devices available to concerned parents, but none of these are 100% effective and objectionable material does leak through. What began as a concept needed to be crafted into a vision for Mark Smith and his development team. However, BrowseSafe faced some dilemmas. BrowseSafe believes in freedom, but the company also believes that unrestricted access to the Internet should not be compromised by the intrusion of unwanted material. While BrowseSafe is against government censorship, children deserve to be safe from Internet exploitation. In the end, the vision became clear - Parents are the ultimate decision-makers of what material and information their family members should access on the Internet.","Internet Services, Software",,,,1,,30000000,USD,30000000,30000000,USD,30000000,Swartz Private Equity,1,1,,Private,,,,,,
