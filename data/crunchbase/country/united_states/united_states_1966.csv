Using the 3doo VoD platform, 3D content owners determine the price per viewing as well as the markets in which content is to be distributed, and receive the majority of net VoD revenues after deduction of streaming & transaction costs and applicable taxes.  The VoD platform is non-exclusive and 3doo does not license content, so that content owners always control and manage worldwide content distribution through a 3doo account. The VoD platform is available using 3doo’s “Player App,” available for free, either pre-installed or downloadable, on 65 million 3D-enabled Samsung, LG and Panasonic Smart TVs worldwide, to view a growing library of hundreds of hours of 3D entertainment and documentary titles.  To view paid VoD content, viewers will require only an account with PayPal, which they link to their 3doo account.  3doo’s 3D video portfolio, to eventually include Ultra HD content, is projected to include major Hollywood, Bollywood and Asian studio content, and sports, theatrical productions, television series and live events.  3doo’s Player App, which dynamically generates channels and allows producers to distribute 3D content directly into Smart TVs, has been awarded as a “Best 3D Product” by the International 3D & Advanced Imaging Society for its “innovation and user-friendly qualities.”  3doo offers geo-targeted advertising with highly effective 3D video and display advertising. Producers and distributors interested in marketing and subsequently monetizing their 3D content to millions of 3D TV viewers around the globe can sign up at no charge at www.3doo.com 3doo has already begun to develop app architecture for Ultra HD Smart TVs, 3D mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, and for new video gaming, personal 3D content and social networking platforms.","Hardware, Software",1,Michael Stougiannos,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

In 1952 Harry Truman was in the last years of his presidency and the hot new thing in Denver was an exotic technology called television. On October 12, 1952, KBTV Channel 9 began broadcasting a mixture of ABC and CBS network programs as well as local news and other programs, stating the beginning of a legacy that continues well into a new century. When Channel 9 was born only a few homes had TV sets, but that changed over time until virtually everyone had access to one. After originally broadcasting from a temporary location, the station moved into its home at 1089 Bannock Street in Denver in 1953, where it stayed until moving to its current location at 500 Speer Blvd in 1992. After initially sharing programs from a variety of networks, Channel 9 became an ABC affiliate for more than 40 years until switching to its current NBC partnership in 1995. Channel 9’s call letters changed from KBTV to KUSA in 1984. Max Goldberg is widely considered as the ‘father’ of Channel 9 for organizing the original group of investors and lobbying for an FCC license, the key ingredient for all radio and television broadcasters. In 1955, John Mullins bought the station which he owned until his death in 1969. In 1971, a company called Combined Communications Corporation bought the station making it part of a group that eventually merged with [Gannett](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/gannett), now one of the largest media companies in the country with TV stations in 32 American cities and a newspaper group that includes [USA Today](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/usa-today). In the beginning, Channel 9 was merely a single TV channel. Today, it broadcasts programs on KUSA Channel 9 as well as KTVD Channel 20 (since 2006) and digital channels, 9.2 (24 hour weather programs) and 20.2 (Me TV). In addition, 9NEWS is now very much 9news.com which was launched in the 1990s and now is a vital news source for Coloradoans that updates news, weather, and sports 24 hours a day.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment",,,10001+,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

You’ll quickly see that QuickCharts software is easy to navigate and implement. Our paperless software is able to assemble thorough and professional SOAP notes by either using a touch screen or regular screen. Every chiropractor can create quality SOAP notes in just seconds with our software.  We’ve listened to what doctors want in their software and learned that note-taking requirements are becoming more stringent all the time. Most chiropractic software systems miss the mark on what a chiropractor really needs for paperless software — speed, quality, and amazing support! Overall, we know that better SOAP note documentation, less paperwork, customer service, and speed were the most important elements for a chosen software. Don’t take our word for it, though — read what other doctors have said about QuickCharts.

Unlike traditional solutions, Quantivo empowers you to quickly audit, load, integrate and analyze large data sets from disparate sources – within hours, not weeks. This is only possible because of Quantivo's proven, proprietary pattern-store technology, advanced query engine, and elastic cloud architecture. These powerful capabilities drastically simplify the loading of data, and enables users to discover associations in their data through a drag-and-drop interface. Through this intuitive query interface, users receive answers from complicated queries within seconds.  The combination of a friendly UI, short learning curve, and affordable pricing model allows Quantivo to be adopted by larger audiences within the organization and brings powerful ad-hoc analysis to companies of all sizes. With Quantivo's patented technology platform, business users can directly interact with their massive data assets to gain business insight and uncover key monetizable trends that are often buried in complex storage systems, lost within channels between business users and IT support, or inaccessible with traditional analytics solutions that lack insight into event-level detail.  Quantivo's analytics platform has been in commercial use by Fortune 500 companies since 2005 and has been awarded five US patents. Quantivo is backed by top-tier venture capital firms, including Foundation Capital and Partech International.","Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Internet Services, Software",1,Paul O'Leary,11-50,2,M&A,7100000,USD,7100000,9400000,USD,9400000,"Partech, Foundation Capital",,2,,Private,,,,,,
