You go to a specialist to treat the symptom and when the underlying issue is discovered, you are sent to another specialist to treat it. The same is true for behavioral health. For example, many eating disorder treatment programs are not adequately equipped to deal with substance abuse; many substance abuse treatment centers will dismiss clients for eating disordered behaviors. Because of this, many clients start playing Whack-a-Mole. At Reed Behavioral Health, our approach is different. It starts with a comprehensive and individualized assessment process so we can determine how to best help you. This includes a firm understanding of your value system, and what you want out of life. We offer individualized care using an integrative model. Our professional team is cross-trained with a high level of expertise to treat multiple disorders. It’s an approach that takes time.
