Our mission is to rekindle the joy of making new friends while discovering the multitude of exciting things your city has to offer. The site invites you and your group(s) of friends to connect with new interesting people and to hang out over a multitude of real-life happenings in a given city, that are called 'Townhangs'. Regardless of where we’re at in our lives, most of us feel a constant earning for the excitement of meeting new people and making new friends. This is natural and instinctive - we’re fundamentally social animals after all. When we do meet new people, it’s either because we get introduced or happened to be at the same place doing the same thing. But way too often, our busy schedules dictate routines, and routines don’t provide the natural environment to make new encounters. Breaking out of these routines is a time-consuming chore: you simply don’t know where to start and ultimately, you don’t know if it’s going to be worth your while. We grew accustomed to the Internet being a facilitator for many difficult and time-consuming processes (shopping, travel, etc.). It seems instinctive that the Internet should provide a way to facilitate this problem too, but it doesn’t. Dating sites are excellent at reducing the beauty of romance to browsing profile photos and sitting face to face in a restaurant waiting for what’s next. MeetUp commits you to a structured hobby with little regard to who you’re going to meet and whether you’ll get along. Our solution is built on three factors: 1) Don’t go alone. Do it with your friends. Mingling between groups of friends is way more natural! 2) Don’t stress overthinking what to talk about.  Share an experience that you can bond over. 3) Don’t leave disappointed. Know who you’re meeting in advance and make sure it’s worth your while We’ve developed an online platform that mimics the real life environment and connects groups of friends over real fun, about-town hangouts that what we call Townhangs. It’s very simple: thinking of something particular to do with your friends? Post a Townhang in seconds and let the world know about it! Meanwhile, other groups of friends will be hanging on the site looking for cool things they’d like to do and will find you! People can learn about each other and chat before committing to meet. Psst…Townhang is addictive! Our Crystal Ball will provide insight into your Interest Universe, so we’ll keep you in the loop on new Townhangs that will take you off your couch! Townhang will travel with you too, be there when you are discovering a new city, connecting you to interesting locals!","Community and Lifestyle, Content and Publishing, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment",1,Alexey Karpov,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
