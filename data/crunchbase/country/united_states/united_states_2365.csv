Additionally, it includes proximity, temperature and light sensors and will communicate to you via Bluetooth with light codes. All this, controlled from your Smartphone or PC/Mac. From a friendly mobile application, your phone mic will allow the L8 to recognize sounds and create light notifications. This way, if your doorbell rings, the oven timer goes off, or somebody is calling you home, the L8 will make you aware of it through light codes. You’ll choose the uses but you’ll also be able to create your owns since the programming code is open so that anyone can modify or improve it to fit their needs. Because the L8 is connected to your Smartphone or PC, it’s connected to the Internet, making you aware when you receive a new email, a facebook notification or your favourite team score. Besides, its built-in sensors will let you know, at all times, what is around you and reacting to any changes. For instance, when it gets dark, the luminosity sensor will detect it and automatically increase the L8 brightness or, if somebodyopens your home door, its proximity sensor will make your L8 shine and send a message right away to your Smartphone. And, of course, with its 64 LEDs in one side and the super LED in the other, it will light your room using less power than a traditional lamp, allowing you to controlboth the brightness and color.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Internet Services, Software",4,"Alvaro Martinez Esteve, Carlos Conejero, Carlos Kuchkovsky, Daniel Alvarez",1-10,1,,,,,203000,USD,203000,,,,,Private,,,,,,
