Mr. Newman had a vision to see churches “organizing God’s people” by utilizing the emerging technology of personal computers.  He was passionate that churches could do this in a way that would enhance their ministry while reducing administrative overload. Witnessing an marketplace filled with overpriced and unreliable products that were extremely difficult to learn and use, he decided to create an entirely new software program to help churches. Collaborating with two developers he created the first version of Servant Keeper and was the sole employee for the first year. From the start Mr. Newman’s vision was to develop powerful church software that was affordable and easy to use.  Working from a converted “apple house” in his back yard, Mr. Newman started calling churches to tell them about Servant Keeper. Customers immediately loved what they saw in Servant Keeper and from the very first days churches have switched to Servant Keeper because of its ease of use and affordability.  Many churches even abandoned other programs on which they had spent thousands of dollars. They did this because Servant Keeper offered all of the same features, plus some, and did it in a way that even a computer novice could figure out. While Servant PC Resources has grown tremendously the vision has stayed the same.   Servant PC Resources offices are now located in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania.   We like to acknowledge that God has blessed us with many amazing employees in Sales, Help Desk, Developers and Administration, all working together under the same roof with an average tenure of 9 years. They invite you to check out the Servant Keeper software suite and give us a call and let us know how your ministry is doing and how we can help. We will be very happy to serve you and help you in “organizing God’s people.”",Software,1,Ed Newman,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

While we succeeded in creating a functional on demand emergency responder network of 15000+ emergency responders in India across 100+ cities / towns comprising of ambulances, doctors, nurses, paramedics, pharmacists etc. and 500+ emergency responders in UAE and achieved success both in technology platform and operational process in making the system work through mobile apps and call centers, we failed in making unit economics positive while providing each emergency medical response service. In effect, we were losing money on every emergency medical response we did. We soon recognized that we are running out of funds.

While we were preparing to shut down the emergency responder network, CONNECT AND HEAL (www.connectandheal.com), a Singaporean Company with operations in India and South East Asia reached out to us, discussed potential synergies and took over the technology, platform, network, operations and team of MUrgency – One Global Emergency Response Network in India for mutually agreed value.

With a real-time accurate treatment environment, clinicians can focus on doing what matters most—providing quality care to their patients. The idea for Maya Healthcare began 10 years ago in an actual home healthcare office. Our founder noticed his facility’s nurses struggling to use outdated EMRs. Although there were several options on the market, most of them had the same user pain points, such as:  - Difficulty coordinating care and scheduling accurately. - Failure to provide a clear picture of patient health.  - A steep learning curve and lengthy user training process. - Redundancies in data entry that take up much of nurses’ time. - Unreliable mobile platforms. In order to simplify the record-keeping process and create solutions based on real problems, we work with top UX designers, an in-house programming team, and current home healthcare nurses. Through this process, we are able to address user pain points and tailor our product design for the best possible user experience. At this point, we have basic functionality and our first set of required forms complete. We are looking for an investor to help bring us to MVP.
