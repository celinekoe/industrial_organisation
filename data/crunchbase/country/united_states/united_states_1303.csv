TaxCloud automatically keeps track of how things are taxed differently across all the states, automatically recognizes sales tax holidays, integrates easily with shopping carts and ordering systems, and helps online retailers instantly calculate, collect and remit sales tax.  With TaxCloud, even the smallest of businesses can easily manage sales tax in one state or all states - at no cost.  Perhaps more important than the free price tag, is the fact that TaxCloud has already been certified by many the states, which provides the retailers significantly reduced compliance risk (via indemnification, limitation of liability, and audit relief). In such an environment businesses need a trusted and stable compliance partner capable of easily handling their current obligations, but also a solution that can scale to handle any additional obligations they may have in the future. TaxCloud is trusted by more than 26,000 online retailers every day (and adding more every day). Our mission and message is simple: We believe no retailer should have to pay to comply with sales tax obligations because most jurisdictions are eager to ensure their sales taxes are collected correctly and remitted timely. By shifting the efforts of compliance back upon the states, TaxCloud has inverted the traditional tax technology marketplace, making sales tax compliance easy (and even free) for retailers of any size.
