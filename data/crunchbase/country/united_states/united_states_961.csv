Our main mission is to provide the users with a chance to meet the people they’ve come across. Most of the existing dating apps fail to solve the “expectation vs reality” problem. The user pics on a suppositive Tinder or Badoo are far from reality. We’ve decided to go obverse and allow the user to first meet somebody in real life and then find them on the app. Girls, just like in real life, have significant advantages which is how we deal with gender inequality that other dating services have.  The technical solution is based on a smart geolocation filtering system. The system allows for quick and precise identification of the real-life encounters, as well as showing them in the app in the most informative way.  The user experience is based around a map and their bumps on it, while in real-time​, a user can see on a map who, where, when and how many times they’ve bumped into. Or just watch the bump history in the list any time. Young active people who are open to new encounters make the app’s target auditory.","Community and Lifestyle, Mobile",2,"Mark Prutskiy, Valentyn Berehovyi",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

They provide rapid relief without the side effects and contraindications associated with OTC medications.

Each product is formulated with a concentrate of oxygen in a safe and stable saline solution that is readily recognized and absorbed by the body, and delivers a potent boost of oxygen that improves overall health, as well as cleanses, moisturizes and reduces congestion.     As with all Oxy Bump products, they are pH neutral and non-addictive and can be used as much as needed without risk of overuse and have no adverse side-effects. It addresses an underserved market segment of today’s health-conscious consumers, who are increasingly demanding wellness products that are safe, family-friendly, and suitable for everyday use.     The oxygen-powered effectiveness of Oxy Bump is distinguished by an attention-grabbing bottle design, which was awarded with an NACD Gold design award. It creates colorful, eye-catching presentations that immediately capture shopper interest. Oxy Bump has a sharp contemporary design and vibrant color pops unique to the otherwise staid sinus/allergy category.
