On a single server node, Gensonix DB can run up to 32 database nodes as opposed to 1. Thus, Gensonix DB demonstrated 16,800 compute nodes on the OSC Supercomputer, the largest DB run ever. Scientel is proceeding to commercialize this technology and has developed server appliances that can run up to 3500 database compute nodes on a single cluster; one of the largest in the industry. It is one of the very few server appliances that can handle an exabyte(1 Billion GB) of data making it the Ultimate Big Data solution.  These appliances utilize large number of CPU cores and thus Scientel has become an attractive target to CPU and server companies.

They are leading efforts to provide innovative solutions to complex problems, promote positive engagement in meeting today's global challenges, and ensure the full participation of all Americans. Their Work is driven by their own background as issue advocates and their belief that the stronger the groups are, and the tighter their collaboration, the more likely they are to win real victories. Their Experience has proven that providing shared resources, eliminating duplication of effort, developing agreed-upon messages, and providing consulting advice and support can successfully shift media discourse and move issues forward. Since their founding in 2008 they have played a central role in multi-organizational efforts to reduce Pentagon spending; challenge discriminatory policies and prejudice directed against Muslim, Arab and South Asian Americans; ratify the START nuclear arms treaty; challenge the unlawful treatment of terror suspects and detainees; publicize the warrantless surveillance of citizens; and push for a negotiated outcome to the stand-off with Iran. In 2013, they began working with the leading organizations in the United States who are reducing the corrosive influence of money in politics and ensuring a fair court system. ReThink Media was founded with a clear mission: to provide their member groups and the campaigns they serve with affordable access to state-of-the-art media technologies, communications training, professional support, and both public opinion and media analysis––and ultimately, to help them win.","Other, Social Impact",2,"Lynn Fahselt, Peter Ferenbach",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
