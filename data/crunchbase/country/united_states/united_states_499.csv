The TipSense platform was engineered from the ground up and goes beyond the capabilities of existing data mining, big data analytics, and traditional Bayesian and LDA models.  Central to the platform are new core technologies such as conceptual entity recognition and content fingerprinting that boost the signal to a much higher level than previously possible. These systems are augmented with NLP, topic modeling, and other advanced statistical methods, resulting in a platform that is able to understand any type of unstructured content, and then transform it into new actionable 'first-class' data.  The TipSense platform is able to associate content to concepts and topics in a user-facing manner. This format can provide unprecedented capabilities in enhancing and enriching existing content targeting models based on the actual underlying data.  By leveraging topics, concepts, sentiments, and highly contextualized content fingerprints trained against orthogonal domains to generate highly domain specific models, the TipSense platform improves the usefulness and relevance of search results.  By breaking away from the limitations of matching keywords and descriptions, the TipSense platform can transform vast amounts of unstructured and semi-structured content into a fully annotated conceptual model.  The TipSense platform powers appcrawlr.com and dishtip.com and can also be extended to other large content domains including social, retail, search, reviews and more.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Science and Engineering, Software",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Community Farmers Markets currently operates the East Atlanta Village Farmers Market, Grant Park Farmers Market, Decatur Farmers Market, and an education program. They leverage community assets with mission critical partners to build a stronger local food system. CFM increases the efficiency and sustainability of local farmers markets by: • Providing educational programming to farmers, producers, customers, and the community around sustainability, nutrition, and wellness. - Creating a unified marketing strategy and community outreach programs to increase access to and awareness of farmers markets, especially in diverse, low-income neighborhoods. - Offering management and start-up consulting services to farmers, producers, and other farmers markets. - Creating economies of scale by aggregating resources. Community Farmers Markets (CFM) was founded by leaders in the local food movement in Atlanta out of a demand for more efficiently-managed, community-based, sustainable farmers markets. These stakeholders include farmers and local leaders who work for a more vibrant local food system and who have special interest, talents, or resources to build a stronger local food movement. Building upon the success of the East Atlanta Village Farmers Market (EAVFM), CFM replicated the EAVFM model and expanded to the Grant Park neighborhood in 2011. The Grant Park Farmers Market was an instantaneous success with 30 vendors and over 1,800 shoppers on opening day. By pooling resources and expertise, CFM has the capacity to go beyond the role of a traditional farmers market and expand the services offered by these markets, specifically around health education, professional development, and community building. In the 2011 season, the EAVFM developed an extensive educational outreach and community building model. Community Farmers Markets serves as an umbrella organization with community-level neighborhood advisory boards for each market. The neighborhood boards are made up of at least two farmers, two residents, two business owners, and one at large member. This smart growth model enables CFM to focus on efficiencies in management and operations, while the neighborhood advisory boards ensure that the markets are meeting the needs and desires of each group of vendors and larger community. CFM leverages strong partnerships with mission-critical partners in their communities and the city at large.","Agriculture and Farming, Community and Lifestyle, Food and Beverage",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
