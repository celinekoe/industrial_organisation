Our ultimate goal is to build the go-to platform for documenting all the world's organisms and through doing this we hope to develop an effective way to measure Mother Nature's pulse. By encouraging the mobile masses to document their encounters with nature, we hope to build a powerful force for data collection and an important educational tool for wildlife awareness and preservation. We hope you'll support us on this mission by joining Project Noah today. Shortly after launching February of 2010, we earned a spot in the first Startl Mobile Design Boost where we had the opportunity to improve our design with the help of the Startl team and folks from IDEO. A few months later we won the inaugural â€œBreakthrough in Mobile Learningâ€ prize from the Joan Ganz Cooney Center. With the $50K cash prize we were able to design our next generation software and attract National Geographic as an investor. _Wall Street Journal_ For the developers at New York start-up Networked Organisms, smartphones are the butterfly nets of the 21st Century. Their tool, Project Noah, lets people upload photos of plants and wildlife around them, creating a map of the natural world and contributing to scientific research in the process. _CNN_ Bespectacled scientists of yore would carry around hefty field guides, made up of hundreds of pages of text and photos. But these days, smartphone owners have a lighter option: an app called Project Noah, which aims to help people identify plants and animals as well as collect data from ""citizen scientists"" about where certain species are located.  _National Geographic_ Do you love nature? Explore and document local wildlife around you and share your spottings with research groups. Project Noah harnesses the power of citizen scientists everywhere to discover the worldâ€:tm:s organisms. Join the effort now. _New York Times_ Project Noah lets you take cellphone pictures of bugs and trees and then sends back an identification of the exact type in as little as 24 hours. _Huffington Post_ The app functionality is impressive, as is their mission: to make this app the most powerful 'window' to the world. _Slate_ Project Noah has found the sweet spot between professional scientists and casual naturalists. It began as an app for people to share their nature sightings but has evolved into a scientific and culturally relevant tool for both the masses and the experts. _Gizmodo_ This could be an app that makes you relinquish control of your iPhone and see the nearest kid around you begin a lifelong journey in wildlife appreciation.","Mobile, Platforms, Software, Sustainability",2,"Martin Ceperley, Peter Horvath",1-10,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,National Geographic,,1,,Private,,,,,,
