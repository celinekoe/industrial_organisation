(the “CAR INC”) is a FinTech company driven to plug the gaps in the crypto market and bridge the governance institutions with the existing and new thought leaders of the crypto industry.The crypto industry holds invaluable opportunities towards exponential economic growth through financial inclusion and participation of the masses. A new world is being born out of the reinvention of the financial systems built on unprecedented technological advances. And the Company is already in play to reap the benefits for its investors. As complex as the Company’s products and expertise are, the business model is simple, sustainable and highly profitable. All offered services are for profit—subscription-based models but are customized to each product line. This hedges the Company’s risk and also allows for identification of the most profitable revenue model, with the flexibility of replicating it. The Company has the experts and has developed unparalleled crypto market solutions. Now, the Company is rapidly acquiring customers. With a comprehensive Go-To-Market plan and an exhaustive Marketing strategy already in play, the Company has leveraged its technical expertise towards data analyses and automation to allow its subject experts to continuously innovate them using machine learning algorithms. The Company already has exciting products in the pipeline: Crypto Index, Crypto Sovereign and ETF Rating platforms, and more. In parallel, it also has a geographic expansion strategy in place—furthering financial inclusion. The Company’s leadership is made of technology and finance leaders with a combined experience of 200+ years—in entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship. And the Company’s team is first and foremost passionate about Blockchain technology and its applications. We are the only ones in the industry with such holistic product offerings built on total compliance. It is exciting to bring our solutions and structure to this nascent industry and are confident that it will soon be shaping governmental and institutional policies. The Company is destined to be a change leader and wants you to join this exhilarating journey. We have developed solutions to resolve the four key challenges of the crypto industry: 1. Minimal Regulatory Oversight: Crypto Asset Rating Platform (CARP), an Independent Structured Rating Agency, comprehensively rate crypto assets for Institutional and Retail Clients. The Company developed custom rating algorithm to conduct an exhaustive multi-layered evaluation across 125 parameters from 15 categories and appraisal against four distinct risk buckets—business, financial, legal and technology. 2. Illiquid Asset Market: Tokenization Asset Platform (TAP) is a Software as a Service (SaaS) tokenization platform that offers the process of creating, issuing, managing and converting an asset to digital securities programmatically on Blockchain in a more restrictive and compliant way by embedding the logic in Smart Contracts. TAP also allows an issuer to create securities under various jurisdictions in a compliant way with a lock period, define vesting schedules, configure transfer and selling restrictions for inside and outside the exchange in accordance with regulatory rules, investor whitelisting, perform KYC and AML checks, digital securities recovery process, provide dividend distribution of tokens and conduct a voting event for shareholders. 3. Trusted Community Deficit: The Company’s quality content knowledge platform, Crypto Business World (CBW), is the one-stop-shop for all updates in the crypto market. It integrates in-house and external content to deliver subject matter across all platforms—news and articles, videos and podcasts, analysis reports and press releases. Additionally, it incentivizes industry experts to publish verified content on CBW through its ‘Content Marketplace’ feature. Thus, a trusted community (External Analyst-EA) is being developed. The Company developed a custom profile and consensus algorithm to nurture the trusted community. 4. Lack of Knowledge: The Crypto Training Platform (CTP) aims at leveraging experts and specialists from all of the Company's products, and their knowledge, to deliver Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) and learning platforms and partnerships. This platform is a personal dream of the CEO and is currently under development.","Financial Services, Information Technology",1,Pramod Attarde,101-250,3,Seed,225000,USD,225000,317000,USD,317000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

But when you’re ready to find that special someone, today's dating apps often fall short. After all, more than half of all couples today still meet through friends, family and co-workers. That old adage still rings true: it's all about who you know. What if there was an app that leveraged the best of modern online dating and the power of your friends and your extended personal network? Meet M8, a human-powered relationship matchmaking platform. Think of it as a massive kickstarter campaign for your love life.  We built M8 on the simple premise that the best matches come from the people who know you best. At M8, we recruit and reward your friends to become your “virtual wingman” -- who vouch for you via a written personal endorsement and then introduce you to all of their single friends.  We believe that real-life friend endorsements and introductions provide an important human dimension to our platform giving both you and your matches better insight into potential compatibility and a “warm intro” that establishes common ground. The end result? A dating app that actually does what it's supposed to do.   And by incorporating two user tracks - Dater and Matchmaker - M8 has something for everybody - whether you’re single, in a relationship, or married with kids. Also when a Dater gets into a relationship on M8, he or she can simply turn off their dating profile and play Matchmaker. The average person will actually go thru 7 to 8 relationships before finding the one.  We call this - the M8 virtuous cycle.  It's also free to get started!
