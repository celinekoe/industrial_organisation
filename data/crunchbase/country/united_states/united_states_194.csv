Through its â€œpatent pendingâ€ business method, software and technology platform, the Company uniquely identifies and connects the consumerâ€™s personal Media Devices (i.e., smart phones, iPods, iPads, game consoles, Google tv, set top boxes, etc.) into a single network, via, the internet.  The Companyâ€™s technology platform then uses the Devices as advertising mediums, making them instantly available to advertisers who are able to uniquely locate and identify the Devices based on the advertiserâ€™s target market preferences.  Once the Devices are located and identified, the advertiser can upload and program both static and audio/video ads directly to the Devices, utilizing multiple parameters.  The Consumer obtains a percentage of the gross revenue generated over his/her Device as a perpetual use licensing fee which is electronically deposited in the Consumerâ€™s account for every ad played on the Consumerâ€™s Device. WrightCommâ€™s â€œoff-siteâ€ technology platform--boasting an advertising platform more potent and with more strategic marketing options than any in the world--refers to technology that uses the internet to broadcast and advertise outside the web environment and over remote media devices owned by individual members of the public who are allowed to connect their media device to the WrightComm network free of charge. The Companyâ€™s â€œoff-siteâ€ technology allows and enables the advertiser to perform market research, create target markets, conduct surveys, market test their product or services and generate detailed reports on the results, all without cost to the advertiser and all self-service.  The click option enables the Consumer to go on an advertiserâ€™s website by clicking on the advertiserâ€™s video or static ad while playing on the Media Device. Because the Consumer is actually requesting the ad he/she is clicking on, this technology is akin to Cost Per Click (CPC).  In fact, advertisers and Publishers can program ads over cell phones and other remote media devices in such a way that they can differentiate the websiteâ€™s direct sales from those sales generated from the click ads programmed on the WrightComm network.  No other ad network or publisher advertising over cell phones and other remote media devices has been able to achieve this goal and provide it as a service without cost.","Advertising, Sales and Marketing",1,"Isaac Wright, Jr.",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
