Our primary business involves rehabilitating mature fields through gas injection. These projects often require capital in excess of ten times the cost of the oil field itself, and they further require world-class technical sophistication to execute.   Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most important injectant we work with because of its physical potency and its abundance. Furthermore, CO2 emissions are being regulated ever more tightly, driving needs for commercial management. Our EOR projects result in the long-term storage of industrial CO2 as well as meaningful oil production.   Although our flagship projects involve gas injection, we are pursuing a wide variety of other oil and gas opportunities that require a high degree of scientific and technical expertise.

This cast off ore from long ago mining activity contains gold content that is profitable to mill at current prices. NRP owns 50% of the mill operation and has secured 70 patented mining claims with over 250,000 tons of ""dump ore"" and over 1.2 million oz of conservatively estimated underground reserves. Funds raised will be used to build a 400 ton/day mill, get into full production processing ore dumps and to continue acquiring strategic gold properties in the district. They have built two pilot mills to prove the concept and have had extensive testing conducted by multiple independent assay firms to validate the level of gold content in the head ore and the concentrate they produce. In addition to the properties they already control, 2 -3 million tons of dump ore remain available in the district at relatively cheap acquisition prices because there is no mill in the region. This mining district is an EPA designated ""superfund"" site because of the toxic metals leaching out of the dump piles throughout the watershed which provides drinking water supply to much of Denver. Local governments have spent millions of dollars on water treatment. Their process effectively cleans up the toxic ore dumps by milling the ore into concentrate that is shipped to the smelter. The tailings from the milling process are detoxified. The process is a profitable way to solve a major environmental problem at no cost to taxpayers. The project is profitable with gold prices above $750/oz. At current gold prices above $1200 per ounce, there is conservatively $85 in gold per ton of dump ore and their all-in cost/ton is $56. This gives us an excellent 34% profit margin which will increase significantly as the price of gold rises further.",Manufacturing,,,1-10,1,,143000,USD,143000,143000,USD,143000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The mission of Brain Power Wellness is to help transform the culture of its partner schools through self-development, mindfulness, community building, retreats, SEL, holistic wellness, and brain training for teachers, students, parents, and administrators.  Brain Power Wellness was founded by Dave Beal, a 5th-grade teacher from Brooklyn, New York.  Passionate about empowering his students, Dave saw that they needed help managing stress, and he explored ways to do this in his own life with mindfulness, yoga, and tai chi. After seeing positive changes in his health and a greater connection with his students, Dave integrated mind-body exercises into his classroom. When school administrators saw the results, they asked Dave to develop school-wide mindfulness and SEL programs.  Eventually, Dave left the classroom to share these powerful principles with more students, staff, and schools. Since 2007, Brain Power Wellness has impacted more than 25,000 teachers and half a million students in 500 schools worldwide.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Millions of couples are sending money back and forth every single day and money is the number one reason relationships fail. Today the process for splitting bills and expenses is manual, time consuming, and can be awkward or tense, plus no one likes doing math. Smoov makes it automatic, accurate and easy. While mirroring consumer behavior of sending money to each other via mobile. How? Smoov integrates with users' existing credit and debit cards and pulls transactions into a private running list.  This creates a very low barrier to entry and eliminates awkward conversations about signing up for a new card together - plus they don't want to do that anyway. Couples set up a default split % for all of their shared expenses that they can adjust on a per transaction basis if they want.  Users swipe which expenses they want to move from their private view to the couples shared view.  Smoov keeps track of the total damage (who owes who how much) and whenever the couple is ready, they can settle up via direct ACH transfer through Smoov. Why? Modern couples who value their financial autonomy are getting married later in life, with more independent wealth and studies show they are fully merging their respective finances less and less - in a world where timing is everything, Smoov fits perfectly into that macro trend among others.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Financial Services, Science and Engineering, Software",1,Tucker Cohen,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
