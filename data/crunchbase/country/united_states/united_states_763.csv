Robinson introduced its first helicopter, the 2-place piston powered R22 in 1979. The R22’s simple design, easy maintenance and low acquisition cost made it popular among private owners and flight schools. As costs became less of a barrier, more people learned to fly and the demand for small, affordable helicopters increased. In 1992, following the same design philosophy as the R22 but with Lycoming’s larger, more powerful O-540 engine, Robinson introduced the 4-place R44 (later designated the R44 Raven I). Ten years later the R44 Raven II was announced, the same as the original R44 but equipped with Lycoming’s IO-540 fuel-injected engine and 28-volt electrical system. Designed by Lycoming, in cooperation with Robinson, the IO-540 enhanced the R44’s ability to perform at high altitudes and in hot temperatures. The Raven II appealed to a broader market and by 2003 R44 sales had doubled R22 sales. During that same time period, Robinson began contemplating ideas for a turbine-powered helicopter. In 2005, an agreement was reached with Rolls Royce to develop the RR300 turbine engine, a derivative of the RR250 series. With the engine in place, development of a 5-place turbine helicopter, the R66 Turbine, moved into high gear. The R66 was FAA certified in 2010 to the current amendment of the federal regulations, including the latest crashworthiness standards. Today, the company’s top sellers are its R44 and R66 helicopters, respectively. Both models are offered in a variety of configurations including float, news and police versions. The most recent addition to Robinson’s line is the R44 Cadet, a two-place R44 specifically designed for the training market. Research and development is of significant importance to Robinson with company continually making improvements and offering new technology.  Among its latest offerings are glass avionics and an autopilot designed specifically for helicopters. Robinson places great emphasis on safety, conducting monthly safety courses for helicopter flight instructors and maintenance courses for technicians.  Robinson is also member of the International Helicopter Safety Team. The company manufactures, assembles, inspects and flight tests all of its helicopters at its Torrance, California factory. To ensure the highest quality and maximize efficiency, Robinson manufactures a large percentage of parts in house and employs a highly skilled workforce. In addition to new production, Robinson offers a factory overhaul program for older aircraft.  A worldwide network of more than 400 Service Centers and Dealers provide service and support. To date, Robinson Helicopter Company has delivered over 13,000 helicopters worldwide.",Manufacturing,1,Frank D. Robinson,1001-5000,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

What is HR Software? HR software is an online tool that enables HR managers to set up, organize, track, and optimize human resources activities - all from one place. It saves the HR team’s time and effort by automating mundane tasks. Additionally, it reduces the potential for human errors or operational delays. The ability of HR software to centralize the employee lifecycle from the interviewing stage to offboarding makes it a must-have for organizations. Some of the finer tasks that a cloud-based HR software can help optimize are - managing and updating employee records, attendance tracking, getting insightful HR reports, etc. Capture and update employee information with ease. Freshteam's HR system comes with customizable forms to collect all the necessary information from your employees so that you remain compliant with all federal regulations. With a dedicated employee self service portal, your employees can update their information on their own whenever they want to, without relying on the HR team. One stop shop for all your employee documentation. While Freshteam onboarding will help you get all the employee contracts e-signed, the document management system in Freshteam will store all the documents in the employee profile; making it easy for employees and the HR team to access them. Better insights with HR reports. With curated and customized reports, make data-driven decisions for your organization. Learn which hiring platform is more effective, where do candidates drop the most in the hiring pipeline, who is the best interviewer and so on. Employee data under one roof Right from the moment an employee joins the organization till their retirement, HR Software will store and manage all their records and documents under one roof. HR teams and employees don’t have to go through mountains of paperwork to update employee records. Everything is available at their fingertips.  Also, the data is retrieved easily based on the HR task at hand. For example, an HR professional concerned with onboarding wants to see a different set of information than someone concerned with time offs. A modern HR software should be able to make accessing relevant information easy. Streamlined Applicant tracking system The ATS feature in HR Software will take care of the entire talent acquisition and onboarding process, right from job posting, candidate screening, candidate engagement, till offer management and employee onboarding.  With ATS, collaborating over hiring decisions becomes easier and efficient. Interview scheduling, communicating with candidates, or collecting and processing feedback, it can all be coordinated from a single central hub.  When the process becomes automated, both the HR employee and the candidate have a delightful experience. Effortless Employee Self Service: Modern workforce looks for a fully automated workplace. In fact, it is an important criterion while choosing to work in an organization. Manual, redundant ways of working are time-consuming and are prone to error. With a dedicated employee self service portal, your employees are not bogged down with paperwork and external dependencies.  With the employee self service feature, you can free up your HR teams’ plate to manage the strategic part of HR instead of operational. In addition, with employees working on their own data, you can count on information being more accurate. Make informed decisions with HR Analytics: With HR software, it becomes easier for HR teams to access and analyze trends, understand what needs to be prioritized, and what needs to be improved. With customizable reports from the HR system, HR teams can present data of their liking and make decisions with more clarity and accuracy. For example, if you see a trend of employees applying for a time off, during a specific month of an year, you can deduce that employees probably feel a little burnout by then. You can introduce measures to mitigate the impact of workload around that time. It’s essential you use an HR tool that can give crucial insights in an easy to analyze fashion. Error-free employee management: Automation takes away the factor of human error. HR Software automates Applicant tracking, time-off, employee onboarding and so on, with little to no human intervention. It removes the scope for tampering or error. This means, your HR team is not spending any time putting off fires. Affordability: HR software comes with a host of features that makes your job easy. You might expect that to make these tools super expensive but that need not be the case. Even the best HR system is affordable. Additionally, HR products will help you save on hiring costs as you need fewer HR folks to manage workload and a quality ATS makes candidate sourcing and screening easy. It also saves on expenses caused by human errors. Employee Data Security: With an HR software employee information stays safe from accidental deletion and unauthorized access.

Zara Realty,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zara-realty,Real Estate,"Jamaica, New York, United States","Zara Realty Holding Corporation, based in the U.S., is an luxury apartment management firm that offers 1, 2, or 3 bedroom establishments.","261,894","Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",$1M to $10M,Active,2011-06-11,day,,,,,For Profit,http://www.zararealty.com/,"Zara Realty is a professional real estate firm based in Jamaica, New York. The company is a family-owned and operated enterprise, with President George Subraj as head of the firm. Tony Subraj is the company’s senior vice-president, with Jay Sobhraj and Ken Subraj both assuming executive vice-president roles.   The company was founded in 1981, and quickly became known for its wide range of high quality residential options available at affordable prices. In its more than 30 years of service to the community, it has established itself as the premier New York real estate firm, providing the residential market with a slew of high value rental properties, most of them located in the Queens and Long Island areas east of Manhattan. By focusing on this particular section of New York, it is able to keep rental rates down while ensuring a higher level of quality with its residential homes and apartments.   Rental options offered include 1, 2, or 3 bedroom units, available in a variety of designs and floor plans. All units come with appliances and furniture included, and most are located within easy access to essential services and amenities. Public transportation options are abundant and close by, and parents and families have convenient access to schools, hospitals, and shopping centers. All these features come together to provide a comfortable and rewarding living experience right at the heart of New York, without all the trappings of big city living.   This focus on a more family-centric lifestyle is one that the team takes very seriously. A proudly family-owned business for more than 30 years, the company’s approach to its service reflects the very same principles that George Subraj and his close-knit family espouse in their own personal lives. For the Subrajs, service to the community and to the real estate market is intrinsically tied in with each other, and the company’s focus on providing the Queens community with high-quality rental options is reflective of that principle.   Of course, this approach has paid off in a big way for the company as well. Their growth over the years has been nothing short of spectacular, and its constantly expanding portfolio of properties and holdings serve as ample testament to the success of the business formula. In 2012, the company acquired a sizable five-building apartment portfolio in Queens for a cool $39 million, greatly expanding its existing holdings. Purchased from real estate firm Urban American, the properties made an ideal addition to their existing holdings due to their location and design.   In June 2016, they added yet another high value portfolio to its holdings with the purchase of a 6-building, 96-unit residential complex in Jamaica. Purchased for $21.5 million, the properties comprised sizable units all large enough to be expanded into two to three bedroom units. Covering a total area of 42,500 square feet, all 96 units are rent stabilized as well, making them even more attractive prospects for individuals and families looking for cost-effective rental options east of Manhattan.",Real Estate,1,George Subraj,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
