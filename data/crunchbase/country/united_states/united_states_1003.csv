We are located less than ten miles from the beautiful Bridger Mountain Range and ninety miles from Yellowstone National Park. We’ve come a long way from our humble beginnings… OP/TECH company started in 1982 in Jackson Hole, Wyoming with the development of the Fast Cap™ product. At that time, OP/TECH USA was only a small dream of a man named Bill Heckerman who was a born innovator. He knew that there was a better way to protect a lens and he was bound and determined to develop it. As an engineer, he was always designing no matter where he was at the moment. The Fast Cap™ was originally designed on a napkin from the Silver Dollar Bar. Who knew that the napkin could be the start of such an enterprising little company? Shortly after the introduction of the Fast Cap™, the Fashion Strap came on the market. Everyone thought we were crazy. After all, who wanted to pay for an aftermarket strap when a webbing strap came with the camera? Besides, what was this neoprene material all about? No one had ever seen neoprene used in this manner before and unless you were an underwater diver, you may have never seen it at all. Looking back, it’s amazing that Bill Heckerman had the tenacity and determination to keep moving forward. Bill was a true Montanan to the core and he wasn’t one to back down if the going got tough. We lost Bill Heckerman in 2009, but his legacy lives on. We’ve continued to think outside of the box and anticipate customer needs so that we can meet them with an innovative solution. Our product offering has expanded greatly over the years yet our commitment to superior function and quality remains. Our products carry a lifetime warranty against defects in materials or workmanship because we feel that people still want a company and product that they can depend on.
