We assist companies in the confidentiality of key business secrets made available under the Freedom Of Information Act (FOIA).  Our core service provides protection against the release of an Importerâ€™s Bill of Ladings and other import records, which are considered sensitive. In recent years several enterprises have made it their core business to gather, organize, and redistribute nearly a billion import records through the FOIA act.  Therefore sparking a new genre of business intelligence.  This intelligence reveals a Companyâ€™s trade secrets such as manufacture identities, arrival dates, and product descriptions.  Having visibility into a Companyâ€™s supply chain jeopardizes their competitive stance.  Which is why Trade Privacy LLC has developed a service to protect Importerâ€™s activities. What we do: 1.  (TRADE-LOCK) We get acknowledgement from the U.S. Customs that disclosing the importing records of a particular U.S. importer to the public, substantially damages their competitive position.  Thereby, earning a Confidential Status for up to 2-years at a time where relevant info will be concealed at Customs. 2. (TRADE-RADAR) We compile all U.S. importing records daily and build a proprietary database for internal use only.
