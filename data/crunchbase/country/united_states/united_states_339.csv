Trevi System has developed an innovative and highly efficient Forward Osmosis (FO) process, in order to produce clean water from saltwater, brackish water, or industrial wastewater at a much lower cost and energy use as compared to Reverse Osmosis (RO) technologies. Rather than force water through a membrane as in RO systems, FO relies on osmotic pressure to draw water across the membrane.  In the FO system, the “feed” solution or contaminated water is pumped to one side of the semi-permeable membrane.  The “draw” solution, which has a high concentration of a specially designed chemical and a low concentration of water relative to the feed solution, is pumped to the other side of the membrane.  The water molecules are attracted or pulled through the membrane via osmotic pressure – that is, the water molecules want to migrate from an area of high water concentration to one of low water concentration. Accordingly, water is pulled through the membrane using no energy, leaving the salts or other contaminants on the opposite side.   The benefits of the Trevi FO system are numerous: it requires only a small fraction, of the electrical energy of current RO systems; it uses relatively low-cost waste heat or low-temperature heat to separate the draw chemical from the clean water; it can be customized to work under specific water conditions such as seawater, brackish water, municipal wastewater, or industrial wastewater; when used for desalination, the system can also be customized to produce brine streams of varying salt concentrations depending on the environmental requirements of the location; and it operates at ambient pressure, avoiding the extra costs of the high-pressure stainless steel plumbing required by RO systems, and the need for expensive high-pressure pumps.","Energy, Natural Resources, Sustainability",1,Steve Sitkiewitz,11-50,2,,8146792,USD,8146792,8146792,USD,8146792,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The US DOE has surveyed 400 top energy efficiency technologies and concluded interior and exterior storm window rank #3 in their carbon reduction potential. Replacement and storm windows are expensive and unpleasant to purchase and install. Solution: Indow, of Portland, Oregon, provides building owners with attractive, affordable, easy to install (and remove), interior window inserts that block drafts 100%, reduce noise up to 70% and save 20% on heating and cooling bills. Our inserts are composed of acrylic glazing edged with our patented Compression Tube and press inside window frames without a mounting bracket. The product comes in seven grades optimized for different needs such as comfort, quiet, IR blocking, UV blocking and more.  Market: In the US alone there are almost 1 billion single-pane windows and hundreds of millions of under-performing double-panes. Our comfort market is focused on owner-occupied homes built before 1950 with single-pane windows and household incomes of $200k to $1M+. Average net revenue of $360 per Indow insert and 2.5 million households fitting this customer profile yield a total US addressable comfort market of over $12 billion. More than 50% of our revenue is to window soundproofing customers blocking outside noise. These customers span a broader range of building types and demographics. The commercial building market potential is also in the tens of billions. There are vast international opportunities for comfort, noise, and energy efficiency. Competitive Advantage: No window insulation solution provides Indow’s unique combination of ease of installation, performance, noise reduction, cost, and aesthetics. Competing interior storm window solutions have inferior aesthetics, more complicated installation, and fail to deal elegantly with out-of-square window frames. Double-pane replacement and storm windows provide inferior noise reduction, are more expensive, and are very disruptive to purchase and install. Our competitive barriers are sustainable. We have received utility patents on three generations of Compression Tubing. Efforts to design around our patents will add complexity and cost. Our marketing is top of category and our proprietary IT system streamlines ordering, measuring, and manufacturing. We have defined an aggressive product and process development path, including the highest performing interior storm windows on the market, and the most cost effective ones. Go-To-Market Strategy: We sell the majority of residential revenue direct to customers via our inside sales team. We also maintain a dealer network focused on commercial projects in major metropolitan areas.  New product development : We will transform the market through dramatic reductions in transaction costs as we make it easier and more affordable for customers from all walks of life to gain comfort, quiet, and energy efficiency.  In Q1 2022 Indow is Beta testing a new product family which will streamline customer ordering and have a much lower entry level price. Our new products and transaction models will enable ecommerce sales, retail sales, and rapidly scalable sales through larger distributors with hundreds of outlets. We also have new product designs for the acoustic and commercial markets.","Other, Platforms, Real Estate",1,Sam Pardue,51-100,4,Early Stage Venture,4100000,USD,4100000,5202500,USD,5202500,"Keiretsu Capital, Portland Seed Fund, WR Hambrecht, Vision Ridge Capital Partners, Alliance of Angels",2,13,,Private,,,,,,

I tried to use the multi-level-marketing model, but I couldn’t get those businesses off the ground. The innovative business model that Prosperity of Life is based on has interested parties reaching out to me for further information. The training and support I received from this business gave me the confidence I needed to start on my own.

I was searching for a way that I could achieve freedom while still being able to use my skills and grow. Joining Prosperity of Life was my best decision ever!
