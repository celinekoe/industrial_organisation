In 1972, the company expanded into the coal trucking and transportation business and purchased a boat to shift barges along the river.  In 1974, Economy Barge was started at the request of the Ohio River Company with focus on the barge repair industry sector.  The success of these ventures led to the creation of Superior Marine Ways, Inc. founded in December 1977, by Dale and Carolyn Manns.  The company was headquartered in Proctorville, Ohio until 1984.   In the spring of 1984, Superior Marine purchased the Burlington, Ohio property, which currently houses the company’s headquarters.  The current office, fabrication and machine shop were built at that time.  Superior then expanded its operations from barge repair to include; inspections, cleaning as well as fabrication and construction.  Currently, Superior Marine has a 28,400 square feet building, two dry docks and eight harbor vessels at their Ohio River mile post 314.9 facility. The summer of 2016 started the expansion to a new subsidiary company, Precision Paint Systems, LLC located adjacent to the Burlington, Ohio facility.    The expansion includes a 26,000 square feet indoor facility, providing a cost-effective and environmentally friendly way to perform blast and painting on marine equipment.   Five new sets of waterways allowing for transferability from land to water for barges and boats were completed with the expansion.   The expansion allows Superior to capitalize on drydock availability to expand services to include ship repair.    In early 2018, Superior Marine acquired an existing river business in Charleston, WV.  This acquisition rounded out the services Superior, which include; dredging, river construction, stevedoring and transloading.

Rewards.com is a brand agnostic loyalty point’s clearinghouse that consolidates all your loyalty programs into one easy efficient marketplace where customers shop, earn points, redeem points, and take advantage of discounts. Rewards.com was spun off from DBG Loyalty in Dallas, a leading innovator in loyalty and rewards marketing programs for Bank of America, Sony, Caesars Entertainment, General Motors, Nissan, Toronto Dominion Bank, American Airlines, Marriott and more, equating to over 30 million customers. The startup includes the executive leadership and mature platform from the parent company. The platform is solid and proven, with 10k registered users, over 7000 coalition merchants including Jet.com, Amazon.com, Walmart.com, Uber, Quicken Loans, Smithsonian, Hyatt, Susan G. Komen, and many more. Revenue is generated each time someone makes a purchase on a merchant site. The merchants pay a commission of 3% to 75% of the total sale to Rewards.com. They also provide special offers, coupons, and discounts for driving high sales volumes to their online storefronts. Rewards.com keeps 40% – 60% of the commission and passes a portion on to the customer. Rewards.com has a significant advantage because it is brand agnostic means it has partnerships and partnership potential with thousands of companies. Being an agnostic loyalty point’s coalition that consolidates loyalty programs into one easy efficient shopping site, is a market first. URL: www.Rewards.com  Industry: Loyalty Points Clearinghouse  What: Consolidates all your loyalty programs into one easy and efficient marketplace  Beta Launch: June 2017  Current Situation: Platform is built and already has 10k active users; over 7000 coalition merchants including Jet.com, Amazon.com, Walmart.com, Uber, Quicken Loans, Smithsonian, CBS, Hyatt, Susan G. Komen, and more.  PROBLEM IN THE MARKET Customers have an average of 29 loyalty programs per. Redeeming is a nightmare.  Customers are tired of too many programs and not enough reward. SOLUTION Rewards.com is a brand agnostic loyalty points clearing house that consolidates all your loyalty programs into one easy and efficient clearinghouse marketplace where customers shop, earn points, redeem points, and take advantage of discounts. The company was spun out of a 15-year old loyalty database marketing company (DBG Loyalty located in Dallas) who is a leading innovator in loyalty and rewards marketing programs for Bank of America, Sony, Caesars Entertainment, General Motors, Nissan, Toronto Dominion Bank, American Airlines, Marriott and more, equating to over 30 million customers. WHY NOW? Coalitions are highly successful in other countries and have been for many years.  The timing is right for the United States and Rewards.com is the right opportunity because it is credit card, bank, and retailer neutral, giving it an edge in forming partnerships with coalition members. MARKET SIZE $291 billion ecommerce industry in the US. (*IBIS World) The Rewards.com Marketplace literally allows a shopper to purchase anything. Electronics, Department Stores, Travel, Office Supplies, Gift Cards, and Home goods are among the most popular categories. Shoppers of all ages, races, and incomes have increasingly more expectations of lower prices combined with a higher value. Rewards Marketplace is the solution for both, giving the Rewards Marketplace an edge over singular businesses that depend on either a low-cost or high-value strategies. The target market includes shoppers who are making purchases online or through a mobile device or tablet, as well as at in-store. Our goal is to identify profitable customers and their purchase patterns, and reward desirable behavior accordingly. Truly giving insight and understanding to behavior loyalty. BUSINESS MODEL Breakage and float are two strategic parts of gift cards and point redemptions. The value of unredeemed points and unused gift cards has significant value. Rewards.com sells points as part of their service offering to marketplace members, and breakage has accrued value. Ultimately Rewards wins if a shopper redeems their point because essentially they just made another purchase that is subject to retailer commission. In addition, revenue is derived from: •	Merchants pay a commission of 3% to 75% of the total sale to Rewards.com for customers and provide special offers, coupons, and discounts for driving high sales volumes to their online storefronts. •	Rewards.com keeps 40% – 60% of the commission and passes a portion on to the customer. •	Revenue from “Featured Advertising” and product placement •	Revenue from Email promotions to the Rewards.com customer database TECHNOLOGY •	Scalable software architecture with the flexibility to dynamically target customers and feature partners. •	Easy for customers to use and gain valuable shopping experiences with the incentives for the masses. COMPETITION Ebates.com is a cash-back model. Although hugely successful they struggle with shopper engagement and retaining shoppers year-after-year. Churn is high and engagement is low. COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE Rewards.com has a significant advantage because it is brand agnostic means it has partnerships and partnership potential with thousands of companies. Being an agnostic loyalty point’s coalition that consolidates loyalty programs into one easy efficient shopping site is a market first. •	Mature and proven technology platform is live •	Seasoned executives who innovated loyalty programs for American Airlines, American Express, IHG and more. •	Estimated customer base 30mm •	Signed strategic partnerships MARKETING PLAN With a $3m raise, $2m will be spent reaching two goals. •	The first goal is to reach 105k active subscribers to reach $7m in revenue. •	The second goal is to reach 180k active subscribers to reach critical mass. FUNDRAISING 2016 – Raised $750,000 in Friends and Family 2017 – Raising $3m on a $12m valuation, Class A shares, with a 5% Dividend USE OF FUNDS Mainly digital marketing in the form of extensive retargeting, content marketing, PPC, social media influencer outreach, email marketing, Public Relations, etc. FOUNDING TEAM Todd Rowan, CEO Todd is the founder and CEO.

Businesses want to be found by new customers, who need to know accurate locations, hours of operation, and other information about the places they want to visit. Application developers need affordable data without onerous legal restrictions or complicated deal terms. Currently, the best place data is very restrictive, expensive, and controlled by a small handful of companies. Quality varies globally, with data concentrated in the biggest markets and poor coverage elsewhere. Even the highest-quality data isn't fresh enough: who hasn't searched online for a store to find it closed or with different hours? Creating and maintaining a dataset like this is a very difficult problem. Restaurants open and close, a store changes hours, a doctor moves her practice across town, or a public building might close for temporary renovations.

We are developing a protocol that will incentivize the collection and maintenance of data for the places people care about worldwide.

The firm provides its services to institutions and high net worth individuals. It invests in the public equity and fixed income markets across the globe. The firm employs a global macro-style approach to investing. Moore Capital Management was founded in 1986 and is based in New York, New York. Moore Capital Management, ran by Louis Bacon. Moore, named after Bacon's middle name, is a $10 billion global macro set of hedge funds. The next few funds we will be covering are global macro oriented funds, which is a switch from some of the more value oriented funds we've been covering, like the 'Tiger Cub' funds including Stephen Mandel's Lone Pine Capital, Lee Ainslie's Maverick Capital, John Griffin's Blue Ridge Capital , and Andreas Halvorsen's Viking Global. Global macro funds seek to find investments in whatever market they can gain an edge, whether it be equities, bonds, currencies, debt, commodities, and more. So, keep in mind that these equity positions only represent a portion of the fund's overall holdings. They are not required to disclose holdings outside of equities, notes, and stock options. Louis Bacon is a famed trader and risk manager. He comes from the group of ""offspring"" of the legendary Commodities Corp. Bacon emerged as one of the great macro traders alongside the likes of Paul Tudor Jones (Tudor Investment Corp), and Bruce Kovner (Caxton Associates). And, interestingly enough, Bacon helped get his firm off the ground when Paul Tudor Jones stopped accepting capital from investors and instead turned them to Bacon's firm. Returning 31% annually since inception in 1990, Bacon can be very proud of his flagship fund, Moore Global Investments, but, it doesn't stop there, as his returns have shown little correlation to the stock market and low volatility. He is the definition of a risk manager. Bacon credits his risk management skills to the futures markets, where he learned to be sensitive to market action. And, he learned such skills at an early age. While getting his MBA at Columbia, he used his student loan money to trade. And, he lost it all. Clearly, he learned a lesson he would never forget. Such a lesson stuck with him as he worked various jobs in the financial industry before eventually starting his own firm. And, in his first year managing Moore Capital Management, he returned 86%. Bacon strives to identify long running macro trends. While he has a longer-term macroeconomic view, he won't let that stop him from making money by trading around the position in the mean time.","Financial Services, Lending and Investments",1,Louis Bacon,251-500,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
