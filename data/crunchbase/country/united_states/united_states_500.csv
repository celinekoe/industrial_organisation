The number of high-schoolers that pursue science, technology, and engineering is not high enough to fill the job openings within Chicago’s growing technology sector. In 2008, Mayor Daley recognized the workforce need and challenged us to create a public school that would match students with the right curriculum, teaching approach and connections to industry to inspire a new generation of technology leaders. Unlike other successful urban high schools, Chicago Tech Academy doesn’t impose barriers like location, money, or skill level on acceptance. We seek students that are motivated by the power of technology and excited about special opportunities to build critical relationships within their desired field. Outside of standard subjects like math and reading, students take 2 technology classes per day, learning everything from mobile app development to project management. By the time they’re seniors, students are able to work on a team consulting clients on their development and design needs. Many students are being held to a higher academic standard than they have been their entire life, and it’s working; ChiTech students show 2-5 times more academic growth in a year than the average CPS student. Students are also paired with a dedicated, one-to-one mentor as part of Generation Tech Mentoring. Mentors guide career exploration and set high expectations for students. Students learn how to think and act like a professional from their mentor.  We’re in our third year and looking forward to graduating our first class in 2013. We’re currently in the process of scaling up Generation Tech Mentoring and launching ChiTech Labs, an innovative partnership model that gives students resume-building experience through joint projects that create value for our partner companies.","Education, Software",1,Terry Howerton,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The founders formed this premise when they were the clients of agencies and simply could not find an agency that could deliver the services, personnel, and business model they needed to solve their business challenges. So, they built that agency themselves, and that is how DMG was born. It was the agency’s obsession with quality of results and service that sparked LEWIS to acquire DMG in 2013, bringing together two of the most respected names in the industry. Combined, they are more than 550 people in 27 offices around the world. Their clients range from early-stage venture-backed start-ups to multibillion-dollar international conglomerates – and they are poised to offer the same integrated engagements, deep level of interaction, and commitment to results across all of them. DMG's founders and principals, Eric Davies and Andy Murphy, remain integral members of the LEWIS team, leading strategic initiatives on behalf of the firm and their clients.

Provide helps child care providers increase their incomes and spend less time on administration. It also reduces the risk of accepting government subsidies, enabling providers to serve the families who need them most. Our service includes three core verticals: (1) assistance claiming public funding; (2) licensing and compliance support; and (3) expense tracking to maximize tax deductions. As we grow, Provide will also connect child care providers to ongoing political work to help them advocate for a streamlined system of fully-funded early childhood education.

We are an all American company based in San Jose, California. We design, develop, and manufacture R/C helicopter products in the USA and overseas. We have grown to become a world class manufacturer, leading the market in R/C helicopters. As the product for the entry level market was constantly being raised in price, Century Helicopter Products responded to the growing need for a good, low priced unit. We designed, manufactured and launched the now world-renowned HAWK series. The current model, Hawk Pro, features the most advanced compliment of upgrades and construction quality in the industry. The Hawk Pro is the ultimate choice for an entry level nitro machine. For our bigger size nitro machine, we have our Radikal N640. It has filled the gap between the 600 and 700 size machines. By offering better fuel economy the Radikal N640 provides the power to keep up with the big boys. Without having to take that giant leap to a 700 class helicopter, the pilot can now enjoy the presence of a larger helicopter at a more affordable entry fee. For the electric market, carrying on the tradition of providing enthusiasts with a durable and an inexpensive way to have fun, we have our Swift line of large electrics and our Radikal E640. The Swifts and Radikal E640 are the perfect choice for all pilots looking for performance in an electric machine. Among all others, Century is well known for petroleum gas powered R/C Helicopters. Our current line, the Radikal series, offers one of the lightest airframes on the market. Designed from the ground up, the simplicity of the design has been executed elegantly offering you the performance you’ve been seeking from a gas powered R/C helicopter. The economic flight times and aerobatic flight performance of the Radikals make them the perfect choice and great additions as top of the line machines to your current fleet. In 2006, Century Helicopter Products has established an agreement with a brand new factory in China to manufacture our products. We have a major control on this factory which will help ensure a constant and reliable flow of our products. They provide almost all of the Century Helicopter Products' current line of R/C helicopters, parts, upgrades, and accessories but also OEM’s to other major brands.

To ensure that parents and caregivers get a real break, typical siblings are welcome to stay at Jill’s House. Their hope is that their model will help change the way communities address the needs of families with children with special needs.  Jill’s House is named after a very special young lady. In 1992, Jill was born a strong and healthy baby to her parents, Lon and Brenda Solomon. Unbeknownst to them, Jill was born with Dravet Syndrome – a rare seizure disorder.  At three months old, Jill started having multiple seizures every day. The Solomons’ happy and peaceful life with three sons and a baby girl began to unravel. Lon and Brenda suffered tremendous stress and exhaustion. Sleepless nights and regular trips to the ER marked their lives.  Jill’s House serves over 500 families raising children with special needs, including many military families. While all Jill's House families experience intense stress, those dedicated to serving our country encounter added complications like deployments and frequent moves. ""I’ve been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan 10 times. Jill's House gives us that moment to simply slow down,"" shared Pat Work, father to Jill’s House guest JP.  When you sponsor a child's stay at Jill's House on a monthly basis you give a recurring gift of Jill's House to families like the Works, keeping their marriages together, restoring their family and giving them a moment to just breathe.","Community and Lifestyle, Health Care, Other, Social Impact",,,101-250,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,Praxis,,1,,Private,,,,,,

Our preclinical, Phase I, Phase I/II and Phase II clinical trials have demonstrated boosting of HIV-specific T cells and specific killing of HIV-infected cells that are not eliminated by current antiretroviral drugs. DermaVir has an excellent safety profile similar to vaccines used in healthy adults and children. The goal of DermaVir immune intensification is to modify HIV disease, decrease antiretroviral drug exposure while maintaining undetectable HIV-RNA levels, thereby achieving a remission (functional cure) in HIV-infected patients. We also have an extensive pipeline of product candidates, a number of which have animal proof of concept, for example, for the treatment of Chlamydia, called ""ChlamyDerm"" and our allergen-specific immunotherapy, called ""DermAll"".

DeLille Cellars currently produces five Bordeaux-styled wines: Grand Ciel, Chaleur Estate Red, D2, Harrison Hill, and Chaleur Estate Blanc.

We have built a traditional ""chai"" styled winery on the family farm owned by the Lill family. This beautiful ten-acre site sits above the Woodinville valley floor, overlooking the wineries of Chateau Ste. Michelle and Columbia Winery. The traditional DeLille Cellars structure allows for winemaking methods as seen in the finest chateaux of Bordeaux, including an underground barrel cellar. All wines from DeLille Cellars are made with the highest handcrafted standards. Only grapes from the oldest and best vineyards in Washington State are acquired. They are hand picked and double hand sorted at crush, insuring that only the finest berry clusters enter fermentation.
