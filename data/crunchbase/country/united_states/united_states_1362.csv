Our goal is to drive targeted, localized traffic and leads to small and medium sized businesses using multiple strategies and tactics. Most SMB verticals are still using antiquated marketing methods in order to reach their targeted customer.  There are literally hundreds of strategies and tactics that can be deployed. Unfortunately, SMBs have neither the time or specialized knowledge necessary to execute.  LocalCustomer has developed a streamlined process which allows SMB's to implement a local marketing strategy and monitor the results from one centralized dashboard.  The LocalCustomer platform matches SMB verticals with certified vendors that may specialize in a specific strategy, tactic or niche. Once on the LocalCustomer platform an SMB can plug into multiple vendors without having to worry about setting up new accounts, losing data or even finding the vendor in the first place. LocalCustomer tracks these campaigns and the results which provides a more targeted, focused strategy to the next SMB who becomes a client within the same vertical.  LocalCustomer provides its own packages for its clients with a heavy focus on customized, local videos that are used for video advertising, video SEO, and brand awareness campaigns within the target market. Our process allows allows SMBs to experience the same high quality production that larger businesses have afforded to do for years. Our team understands that video as a communication medium is the future of  online advertising.  In 5 years almost all online advertising will be viewed instead of read.  Of the nation's 28 million SMBs  the ones who take advantage of this opportunity will have an incredible competitive advantage which will mirror the beginning of search advertising. LocalCustomer with its partners and clients intend to create a the first virtual SMB agency where the changing strategies and tactics are implemented quickly based on real-time big data.","Advertising, Sales and Marketing",,,1-10,1,,20000,USD,20000,20000,USD,20000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

For example, if you are concerned about your current long-term care plan, or have yet to construct a plan, an elder law attorney can advise you on the various options. In addition to this, an attorney can also help lay out a plan to make sure your wishes are carried out if you become disabled or incapacitated later on, and helps you decide who will be in charge of your care if you are unable to care for yourself. When a person has to move into a nursing home, they are required to divest themselves of their assets in order to pay for their care. However, by placing their assets into an Irrevocable Trust, the assets can be protected from high nursing home bills. However, it’s important to remember that this type of transfer must be done at least five years before a person goes into a nursing home. For many people, the best choice for long-term care costs involves setting up a Pooled Income Trust. Open to people of any age, it allows them to become financially eligible for insurance programs such as Medicaid, while at the same time preserving their monthly income in a trust to cover living expenses and other needs. By taking advantage of this option, a person can obtain Medicaid home care services for their long-term care needs, while continuing to have the money available to support themselves while at home. A variety of people can greatly benefit from establishing a pooled income trust, including recipients of personal injury settlements, elderly people who are ill and living at home, younger people who have special needs, and people who are applying for or already receiving government benefits.

Like any other relationship, FIT MATTERS. myEDmatch is a job-matching site for educators that connects schools and teachers with shared missions, beliefs, and goals.  We help great teachers and great schools find each other, leading to great outcomes for kids. Every year, more than half a million teachers in public and private K-12 schools change jobs.  An estimated 1 out of 2 new teachers leave the profession after five years, largely due to dissatisfaction with their work environments.  The cost of recruiting and training new teachers each year is a staggering $7 billion across the country – not to mention the devastating impact teacher turnover has on students and communities. So myEDmatch has made it radically easier to connect the right teacher to the right classroom.  Teachers and schools build online profiles, get matched with high-fit counterparts based on a survey of their core beliefs about education, search for jobs and candidates that meet their needs, and communicate with their favorites, ultimately landing the right teacher in the right classroom. We help teachers: * Develop a comprehensive digital resume and teaching portfolio * Get matched with good-fit schools * Find job opportunities that meet their personal and professional preferences * Save time and energy in the search for their first or next teaching job And we help schools: * Instantly access thousands of candidates from across the country for hard-to-fill positions * Stretch their limited dollars and save them countless hours with our efficient platform * Identify teachers that fit the culture and mission of their school community Teachers can build an online profile and search for jobs for FREE at www.myEDmatch.com.
