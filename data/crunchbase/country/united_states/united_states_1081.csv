They quickly realized that this management process was inefficient and disjointed to say the least. “For the first six months [using multiple platforms], they had no idea whether they were making or losing money,” Katie said. After adding a second clinic and struggling to manage everything on multiple systems for years, they set out to create a software that would allow their clinicians to streamline their work and leave tangled practice management processes behind. Combining their skills in software engineering and practice management, they created HENO — an all-in-one solution that has since saved them time and money. By making HENO available to all physical therapy practices, the Hohmans hope that clinicians will now be able to streamline management tasks and provide more time for what is truly important — the patient.","Health Care, Information Technology, Payments, Sales and Marketing, Software",2,"Jeff Hohman, Katie Hohman",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
