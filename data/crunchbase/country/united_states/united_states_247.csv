As ComputerCare’s business grew and further systems development was required, Abe brought in Rick Graham and later Gerard Presepe to develop and expand their line of apparel industry software solutions, manage staff and service their growing client base. Rick has a business and finance background and was the IT and Production Manager at a textile manufacturing company where Abe was installing CAMS™. Rick became so instrumental in converting this business to CAMS™, working so closely and effectively with Abe, that he was offered a partnership in ComputerCare. Gerard has a mathematics and computer software background, and began his career as a cryptographic mathematician for the National Security Agency.  Realizing that his skills were better suited to a business environment, Abe immediately engaged Gerard to join his growing Team. In 2003, Abe retired and Rick and Gerard assumed ownership.
