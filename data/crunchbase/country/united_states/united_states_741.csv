Consumers love their sweet drinks, but they've also grown tired of the high sugar levels and artificial sweeteners used by most brands. While evaluating natural sweeteners for another project, the founder of Halo - Len Boyko, discovered that water/sap from maple trees, which has for centuries has been boiled down into maple syrup, had enormous potential to be a locally grown solution to a massive global problem; calories in drinks.  Humans, scientists and chemists have been making sweetened, bottled beverages in labs and giant factories for 100 years. And they've spent billions of dollars trying and failing to make a tasty, low calorie drink without adding stuff that may or may not kill us.  All this time, maple trees have been beating the beverage industry at their own game, effortlessly making a low calorie, pure, organic, and delightfully sweet drink. Nothing added.  The potential of maple water is unrivaled as a beverage; being both a base and an ingredient that could give every drink a better sweet. Halo named their brand, BetterSweet to provide enormous flexibility for future line extensions beyond the single ingredient maple water.
