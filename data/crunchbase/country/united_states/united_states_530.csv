Their goal is to bring advanced physics simulation engines that enable true to life, immediate interaction to the nascent virtual reality (VR) industry. They have created a cutting edge physics engine named ""Midas Physics Engine"" to accomplish this, and they are using it to build their own VR games to show off its power and potential. The current generation of VR content focuses on the loose interaction between players and the virtual environment, be it a gadget, a gun, a house, or a scenic landscape. The next generation of VR will foster a much closer interaction between players and the virtual characters. This will be powered by advanced physics simulation technology that will significantly enhance interactivity and invoke strong emotions in players. Research shows that a VR world governed by the same laws of physics as the real world brings a visceral feeling of immersion to players who interact with it. The next generation of VR doesnâ€™t have a ready to use physics engine yet. The world lacks a high fidelity physics simulation engine that addresses all the key requirements of VR to make the virtual reality world feel real: - Physics Driven Characters -  Instead of keyframes, characters are driven by AI and physics simulation which makes them react realistically to every touch and interaction. - Jitter free and explosion free simulation - Their joints are rock steady, prevent positions from flickering inconsistently, and never let parts explode. Without Midas Physics Engine, VR will have physical inconsistencies that will instantly destroy the illusion of reality that is critical to the user experience. - Complex Articulation Structures - Midas Physics Engine can handle modeling complex real world objects like chains, ropes, cranes, and other highly interconnected objects. Mere box colliders are not enough give virtual worlds the feeling of being real.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Gaming, Hardware, Science and Engineering, Software",1,Kevin He,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,"TSVC, Youku Global Media Fund",,2,,Private,,,,,,
