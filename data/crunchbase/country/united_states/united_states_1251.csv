Alderac Entertainment Group gave three ambitious lunatics with keyboards and a dream the chance to produce a d20-based espionage roleplaying game and the world was never the same. Blending elegant, balanced rules with thrilling original settings, Spycraft and its many derivatives landed on the gaming scene like a neutron bomb. Sales charts burst into flames, players took to the streets with graffiti campaigns to spread the word, and the designers were pelted with ridiculous gilded awards in the shape of Ursula Andress in that awesome bikini from Dr. No. Well, that last part might be a bit of an exaggeration, but so far no one’s disproved it in a court of law so we’re sticking to the facts as we know them. Shortly after the release of the game’s second edition, Spycraft 2.0, AEG discontinued most of its RPG lines. This left Spycraft without a home and gave its creators an opportunity to steal it away and make with the happy, happy fun time (read: global domination). Back room deals were brokered and sacrifices were made, and here we are: a band of merry maniacs and a growing army of the coolest, most dedicated fans in the biz, scheming from the shadows. Crafty Games is responsible for the Mistborn Adventure Game, based on the New York Times best-selling novel series by Brandon Sanderson, as well as Fantasy Craft, a high adventure OGL toolkit game that lets you build and play in your world, on your terms; and Little Wizards, a starter RPG designed to introduce kids aged 6 to 10 to the hobby we all know and love. Their next roleplaying game project is the highly anticipated Spycraft Third Edition, a fresh start and a brand new direction for the World’s Greatest Espionage RPG.","Content and Publishing, Gaming, Media and Entertainment",1,Patrick Kapera,1-10,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Log in to your apps through Hardly’s software and with a couple of clicks you can customize the alerts you want to receive at any given time— by project, person, or priority level. You can finally concentrate on getting work done, with less stress. And then once you are done? We have all of those social and promotional pings waiting for you.  – WHY CHOOSE HARDLY?  –  Hardly recognizes that people are dynamic and needs change. One day, you may need some notifications and not want others. The next day, your needs may be the exact opposite. Distracting notifications aren't limited to shopping websites or social media. Sometimes, distractions can come from another client or a coworker. Our app allows you to easily adapt and hone in on your needs for that day, without fear of missing anything important.  — Need to mute a specific client's pings across 6 different apps for one day? One-click.  — Need to prioritize everything on one project but mute the others? One or two clicks.  — Want to mute everything except your mom? Cool. We'll let in your mom's social pings, her emails, her texts and hold everything else. ""BACK UP, WHY DO I CARE?"" 23 mins are lost for every distraction and that adds up to 5 weeks a year— poof! But turning off all notifications is a luxury for bosses and independent workers (aka, not a realistic option for most). Alert fatigue has been a frequently discussed issue in the healthcare and emergency worker industry, but no one has addressed alert fatigue for collaborative desk workers. And current focus apps don’t take into account people’s changing priorities and needs for work and life— they are all cold turkey.
