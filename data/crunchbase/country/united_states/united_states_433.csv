SecureLive Server Edition PHP is designed for web hosting providers, web developers, or anyone with a custom built website.  Our Server Edition (SE) products are the choice of hosting companies and resellers because of how easily SecureLive can protect all the websites on a server.  Web developers love how customizable the security system is, and how it automatically attaches itself into any custom PHP website.  A single SE account can run on up to 4 servers, and keeps individual settings for each domain.  The truth is, when it comes to PHP server protection, no other security application or system can match the superiority and aggressive crime fighting abilities of SecureLiveâ„¢. SecureLiveâ„¢ is the world's first intelligent hacker-crime fighting machine.  The internet is still a wild frontier and protection is vital for the reputation and longevity of your business. Without tight security you are at risk. But trying to find tight security for your Joomla site can be daunting. Even though there are scores of security products out there, they simply do not work well enough to protect you from hundreds of thousands of different attack types that exist. With new threat types being born everyday, most of these products become ineffective overnight leaving you vulnerable and exposed. Weak or inadequate protection may lead to a false sense of security which will ultimately damage your REPUTATION, cause you loss of TIME and MONEY.

That's why you need SecureLiveâ„¢! For one low monthly price, SecureLiveâ„¢ will plug every security hole on your website or server. Never worry about keeping up on the latest hacks again. Say goodbye to never ending security patches and frequent updates because SecureLive updates itself dynamically. Stay current on the latest security threats without lifting a finger.
