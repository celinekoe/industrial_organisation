This website is a directory of bars & pubs where sports fans can search for the best local places to watch their teams. The Back-Story Necessity is the mother of invention. Co-founders Tom O'Malley & Don Lavis began building BarChannels after countless frustrating occasions of needing such a resource. Every week seemed to present the same question: How can a couple of rowdy, high-fiving gentlemen find a bar that is filled with our team's fans and playing our team's games? You can't! Well... you couldn't. But now you can! There are many wonderful websites, apps & guides out there to help people discover bars in their city. A simple search of these resources will conclude that almost all sports bars play a wide range of games. However, many do favor a handful of specific teams and those places truly are your best chances for a great time! BarChannels.com was created to bring like-minded sports fans together at the best places to watch their favorite teams. The 5 Commandments May we never stray from our founding principles: 1. All bar listings shall be kept accurate and up-to-date by our editors. 2. Reviews & ratings shall be informative, helpful and un-biased. 3. This site shall never be overrun with ads, pop-ups or promotions. 4. Simplicity is key, while maintaining sexy aesthetic standards. 5. Push to exceed expectations with fresh content & new features.","Apps, Events, Media and Entertainment, Software, Sports",2,"Don Lavis, Tom O'Malley",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

There is always a need for legal advice when it comes to running any business, but most companies are far too small to support a legal department of their own.  That’s why Kendal Law Group PC exists.  We offer legal solutions to business owners. Corporate business lawyers aren’t always the easiest to work with, but we’re proud to say that we stand out from the rest in that regard.  We want to ensure that our clients are able to solve their legal issues and achieve their objectives in a timely and cost-effective manner. However, we also understand that business law brushes up against several other areas. One example is commercial litigation, and we offer comprehensive services in that regard.  Estate planning seems like such a personal matter, and it is, but that doesn’t mean it is entirely separate from your business.  As the owner of the business, there is a very real chance that debts the company owns will fall to you.  Should you pass before getting your estate in order then those same debts could be forwarded onto your loved ones.  Rather than leave them trying to deal with managing all your leftover debts or going through an annoying and lengthy probate process, why not get everything in order today to save them the pain and confusion?  Working with an estate planning attorney, such as those in Kendal Law Group, can even help you to secure your financial footing and protect your assets so that those previously mentioned debts don’t take you by surprise.  By considering estate planning from a business perspective, you can see just how important it is that you get started planning your estate today and stop waiting until it is too late.

Answer: baby steps - take on a simple piece of the problem, make it an amazing experience, and add on from there. Enter HomeBuzz - a Yelp-like experience for homes. Allow real estate professionals to continue doing their job, compete for commissions, separate the weak from the strong, and allow consumers to benefit. Wouldn't you like to know who has seen a home that is for sale, what they thought about it, and how much they thought it would sell for? Better yet, when the home sells, rank each user according to who was closest to the actual sales price. View, in real time, who is commenting on what property, what they are saying, and how good they are at it. Next baby step - allow users to transact real estate from their mobile device, in real time. Submit an offer, chat with the seller or agent, receive a counter-offer, and work toward an accepted purchase contract, all done within minutes, instead of days. Next baby step - invite all parties involved in the transaction (lender, escrow agent, appraiser, title officer, home inspector, etc) into the conversation. Setup a to-do list for each party and a timeline. Monitor, in real time, who is responsible for what action, and when that action will be complete. Sign documents, complete addendums, review reports, revise terms, and close the transaction. All of this will be done from any device, from anywhere in the world. Next (not so) baby step - roll the platform out globally, and allow transactions anywhere in the world, completed in real-time. This works for rental properties too - San Francisco and NYC were looking at you first.
