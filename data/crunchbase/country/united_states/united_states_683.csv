Feeling limited by the choices available to her and uninspired by boardroom attire, the designer began designing tops that paired sophistication and sensuality. Long before day-to-night pieces were wardrobe staples, Kay Kamran pioneered versatile, feminine, office-appropriate lace tops. Before setting out to share the creations she designed at her kitchen table, Kay Kamran took her signature lace to a dye house to treat the fabric and soon debuted her designs in New York City, launching Kay Celine. Within no time, the orders flowed in and Kay’s collection was born. The tremendous response to the line underscored the previously overlooked need in the marketplace for wearable, fashionable clothes that were appropriate for both work and weekend. For two decades, Kay Celine has favored style over trends, offering wearable silhouettes in constantly evolving prints and fabrics. While the brand quickly established a reputation for its lace and underpinnings, Kay Celine has expanded to include array of fabrications and designs with a focus on bold prints and colors. Always chic and contemporary, Kay Celine pieces are feminine, functional and practical. The brand’s continual growth has included a move toward both office-friendly jersey essentials and day-to-night chiffon pieces. Each design reflects Kay Kamran’s belief that fashion should be free of limitations—every piece should translate into a variety of situations and moods. To that end, every season includes Kay Celine’s signature animal prints and vibrant colors in chic, timeless styles that transcend age, making statement looks wearable for every day.","Clothing and Apparel, Commerce and Shopping, Community and Lifestyle, Design",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
