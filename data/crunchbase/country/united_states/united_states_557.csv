Think back to the last time you had to find potential buyers for your product. The last time I did it I was a Chief Marketing Officer at a tech company. I was paying $70,000 a month to a company that found email lists and send out blasts.   The problem with these campaigns was that the response rates were abysmal with open email rate below 2%. The Spray and Pray method of finding customers don't work anymore. This brings us to Neural Markets. With our suite, you enter your company or product URL, and we create a market for companies that have current initiatives that would benefit from your products.   Neural Markets also gives you the ability to simulate a new market by letting you change product features or messaging and then seeing in real time what your market would be. Once Neural Markets goes thru its Match-making process, we present you with an intelligent map of the systems, tools, and services a company uses.   We call this map a Smart Stack, and we believe it is key to understanding your customer. Think about it. With Smart Stacks, you can walk into a customer and have the confidence of knowing exactly what tools they are using.   In addition, Neural Markets presents you with an Organization Chart detailing essential information about influencers in the customer's buying cycle.   Finally, Neural Markets analyses the personality traits of these key influencers and writes tailored emails or social posts that will directly resonate and help build a strong relationship.   Neural Edge is a game changer. Now with a push of a button, you can create a dynamic market for your products and services. Join us on this revolutionary journey!
