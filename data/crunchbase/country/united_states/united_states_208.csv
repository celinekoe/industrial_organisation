Michael pioneered pre-mixed paints in his trading area, an innovation that garnered M.A.B. a loyal following of professional users. In the early part of the century, Michael expanded M.A.B.’s reach, opening new stores throughout the Philadelphia area. Following the death of Michael A. Bruder in 1932, Michael’s son Thomas A. Bruder took control of the company and continued to oversee its growth. By 1939, there were 13 stores in the region. During Tom’s reign, he made his father’s dream a reality and left behind a vital and growing company. Thomas A. Bruder, Jr. succeeded his father as President of M.A.B. in 1967. Under Tom Jr.’s direction, many new products were introduced and field sales service teams were established to provide information and guidance to builders, architects and contractors in the rapidly evolving paint industry. In 1969, M.A.B. Paints purchased the Smith-Alsop Paint Company, adding new locations in six midwestern states, Alabama, and Florida. Throughout the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, M.A.B. continued to expand its geographic reach with new stores in new markets servicing legions of new professional and do-it-yourself customers.",Manufacturing,,,501-1000,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
