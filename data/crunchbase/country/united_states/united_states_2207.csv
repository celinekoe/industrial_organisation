I will try to avoid all of the enticing self-promoting egos, visions of grandeur, innuendos, and flowery promises normally laced in proposals. I retired out of the construction/home improvement industry over 20 years ago. My company had over 5000 employees and subcontractors in five states. I know how to expand, manage, and grow a business with multiple locations.      Two years ago while living in Maui my wife was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. With a 96% death rate they naturally took her home to Mandeville. This brave woman turned down chemotherapy and radiation making her possibly the rarest survivor in the world. She will tell you that Ion Alkaline Water is a huge part of her recovery.     I have never been more passionate about anything in my life as I am about Ion Alkaline Water. At 67 I hope to do this quicker than the 25 years it took me to grow the construction business. I have five new locations that I personally plan to open this calendar year.     Mandeville Louisiana was a real retail challenge for several reasons. The people are full of life and very friendly but the state is not known for its healthy lifestyle choices ranking third in the nation for obesity. It is rated at number 44 for the lowest income levels, and 45th on education levels. I personally thrive on challenges, yes I spent some money, learned a lot and the store was a huge success its very first year.     Their Ion Alkaline Water purifiers generate a huge profit revenue stream of 3 to 5 hundred percent; but it was the rental market that I established that bridged the gaps, and every rental unit turned onto a sale within six months. They are the future of all world water.","Commerce and Shopping, Health Care, Natural Resources, Sports",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
