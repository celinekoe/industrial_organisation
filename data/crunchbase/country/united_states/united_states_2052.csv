We are capitalizing on three macro trends: 1.  Corporations' need to control growing healthcare costs 2.  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that allows premium discounts inside Health Contingent Wellness Programs 3.  Wide adoption of social networking  Most health improvement programs fail for three reasons: 1.  They do not account for participants' readiness to change  People change in five stages:  pre-contemplation, contemplation, planning, action and maintenance.)  Most online wellness programs only address action items, alienating 80% of the audience.  The Stages of Change model determines what stage of change a person is in and provides coaching and tools to move them to the next stage. 2.  They do not have analytics or a solid ROI CFO's will not budget for programs that do not have a ROI.  We are developing partnerships with health analytics companies that provide before and after assessments based on the company's historical claims data.  This will give us a solid ROI to present to CFO's while maximizing our revenue potential. 3.  They don't leverage the power of groups People change in groups.  Peer pressure, competition and encouragement help people change.  Most health improvement programs focus on the individual and do not capitalize on the potential of groups. The OptaHEALTH program coaches people inside a private social network with a user experience similar to Facebook.  We group people by their change needs (i.e. """"quit smoking"""") and change readiness.  Health coaches participate in these groups, helping move people forward.  Online exercises move participants through the stages of change.  Engagement is supported by points, rewards and incentives for participation along with departmental contests that create competition.","Community and Lifestyle, Health Care",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Apprema,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/apprema,"E-Commerce, Email, Payments","Sunnyvale, California, United States","Apprema is an e-commerce site that provides social gifting, group payment and delivery services.","2,250,672","San Francisco Bay Area, Silicon Valley, West Coast",,Closed,2007-08-23,day,,,,none,For Profit,http://www.apprema.com,"Founded in 2007 by CEO Mark Schreiber, Apprema has developed an easy-to-use online payment and delivery platform for social network gifting. With its exclusive, patent-pending Micro Gifts, Pay Manager (Group Payment), Gift Cards+ and Gift Delivery Network (GDN), Apprema addresses a myriad of obstacles facing consumers who wish to conduct their gifting and delivery online. In addition, Apprema offers unparalleled value, flexibility and choice when it comes to giving Gift Cards.  Using Appremaâ€™s Micro Gifts, consumers can give gifts online that are between $2 and $10 in value. Simply pick a gift from one of our top retailers, like Starbucks or iTunes, wrap it up in one of our designer eWraps, & send it to their email or Apprema Gift Box (a widget that you can easily download to your social network of choice). Apprema Micro eGifts have real value (unlike Facebookâ€™s virtual â€œgiftsâ€) and are a lot more fun to gift and receive. We expect the revenue potential for Micro Gifts to exceed sales of Facebookâ€™s virtual â€œgiftsâ€ (a buck for a jpeg!) in the coming year.  Note that in January 2008, Jeremy Liew of Lightspeed Venture Partners analyzed Facebookâ€™s â€œgiftâ€ sales and concluded that they would yield $15 million this year. Recently, he revised that revenue number to be between $28 million and $43 million.  With Appremaâ€™s exclusive Pay Manager, obstacles commonly associated with group gifting are now a thing of the past. After selecting a gift and providing other group gift participantsâ€™ email addresses, Pay Manager takes over and handles all the payment reminders and processing. No one gets stuck holding the bill or running around collecting payments, which makes Pay Manager a green group gifting solution.  Many consumers have told us that they love giving Gift Cards due to the convenience, but feel that maybe it is a bit impersonal. Others say they want to experience the fun of picking out a personal gift. With Gift Cards+ they get the best of both worlds because they can quickly select a Gift Card and also suggest an item that the recipient may want to purchase with it.  For example, their special someone loves pop music, but they donâ€™t know much about pop artists.  No worriesâ€”they can get him or her an iTunes Gift Card, and attach an image of the latest album release from Justin Timberlake.  Of course, the recipient doesnâ€™t have to buy that particular album; it is simply a fun suggestion.  With Gift Cards+, consumers suggest a gift and let the recipient choose.  Appremaâ€™s GDN is poised to become the new FedEx of online gift delivery. With the GDN, consumers can send gifts via email or the Apprema Gift Box, a widget they can download to their social network of choice. Apprema email gifts delivered via the GDN are not the ho-hum, drab text e-mail/purchase confirmations that most retailers sendâ€¦customers dress â€˜em up & â€œwrapâ€ them in the designer gift eWrap of choice.","Commerce and Shopping, Financial Services, Information Technology, Internet Services, Messaging and Telecommunications, Payments",1,Joyce Fee,1-10,1,,,,,800000,USD,800000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Too many times they’ve gone to see a movie excited by the usual advertising and reviews, then were let down. Why should out-of-touch payroll critics be able to tell you what films you’ll like? They find that user reviews are an afterthought to the studio-owned movie “review sites”. The real problem with review websites today: There isn’t anything that empowers you to write a review. Flicksea is a social atmosphere that can paint a more accurate picture of whether or not you would actually like a film and for you to share your feelings about films you’ve seen. Instead of relying on hired critics to represent popular opinion, Flicksea empowers people to become their own critics and provides a platform where their views are shared with the masses.
