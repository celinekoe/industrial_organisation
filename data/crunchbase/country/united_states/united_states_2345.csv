Our technicians sincerely care about you and your family and will do their best to deliver 110% each and every time. We are well aware of the dangers associated with pesticides and other bed bug killers.

Instead, our technicians will only incorporate the use of the latest, most effective, and safest techniques available. With our company, you’ll never have to worry about suffering adverse reactions or risking your health. Although there are some great, professional exterminators in Indianapolis, consumers need to proceed with caution. Some of these companies do not screen their employees and this can put the consumer and their family in a potentially dangerous situation. This is something we will not tolerate. Our company makes sure all employees are thoroughly background checked and drug-screened before they’re allowed to enter the client’s home. Bedbug infestations can be very embarrassing. We understand this and will do our best to keep your problem a secret from your friends and neighbors. During our visit, we’ll do our best to conceal our tracks, so nobody will know why we’re there.
