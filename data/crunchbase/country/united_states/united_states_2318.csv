We look forward to earning the right to count you among our strategic partners, and guarantee a release to you and your down line should you ever decide to pursue another relationship. However, we're confident that this is a promise we'll never have to deliver on. Like any marketplace, the insurance and annuity arena is always changing. In recent years, the fixed annuity space has grown to a $98 billion industry, with fixed-indexed products accounting for over $54 billion of that figure. Current trends indicate that those numbers only stand to get larger in the years to come, with fixed-indexed annuities comprising an ever-increasing piece of the pie. Our aim at M3 is to rapidly grow this portion of your business by giving your producers the resources they need to effectively position fixed annuities, and the guarantees they offer, within your clients' portfolios. Even as fixed annuities grow in popularity, there is still plenty of information out there that is either outdated or simply inaccurate. A partnership with us gives you access to a staff well-versed in the ins and outs of fixed products, and the situations for which they are most appropriate. We understand that fixed annuities aren't necessarily for every client, or for a client's whole portfolio. Even so, with access to over 30 carriers, we can bring additional value to any book of business.",Financial Services,,,11-50,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
