Riven Accelerates Product Introduction with 3D Reality.  Quickly Diagnose and Fix Deviations from Design Intent.   Reach better decisions with your team and customers. New Product Introduction (NPI) is the most critical stage of manufacturing and it’s broken. An overwhelming majority of companies miss critical ship dates and suffer cost overruns due to NPI issues. Our experience designing and manufacturing thousands of physical products led us to deeply understand the costly mistakes, inefficiencies and frustration caused by sparse, error-prone analog 2D information and poor communication during NPI. These perpetual problems are only getting worse with shorter product windows, more geometrically complex products, higher quality expectations, engineering capacity constraints and fragile supply chains. Riven accelerates product introduction by vastly simplifying how teams develop, iterate and build physical products. Riven fixes broken workflows and enables everyone across the supply chain to work together – visually – on the same product by applying ‘rich as-made’ 3D part insights and digital models. By combining accurate digital 3D copies of real physical 3D parts with intelligent, collaborative software, we are creating a digital-first NPI workflow that improves customer responsiveness, time-to-market, part accuracy and production processes while minimizing development iterations and waste.

In 2014, the AZZLY executive team was requested to provide the same streamlined solution for under served behavioral health and addiction treatment facilities to accommodate their unique processes and regulatory requirements. They began collaborating with Addiction Treatment Clinicians, Joint Commission experts, CARF and State Substance Abuse licensors to ensure that AZZLY’s software would be the best replacement technology for addiction and behavioral health providers. What was missing in behavioral healthcare and addiction treatment was the same rigid standards of care expected from medical practices.

When BACtrack was founded in 2001, breathalyzers were primarily for law enforcement use and costs were high. Keith Nothacker, CEO and Founder of BACtrack, recognized that someone could be arrested with a Blood Alcohol Content of 0.08%, but that the general public had no way to test and measure their own BAC. He developed the first line of consumer breathalyzers.  PIONEERING AN INDUSTRY In 2004, BACtrack was the first company to ever receive US FDA 510(k) marketing clearance to legally sell breathalyzers to consumers for personal use. In fact, BACtrack worked with the FDA to create the evaluation and regulatory criteria for the personal breathalyzer category, which became the benchmark against which all other products were tested.  Since then, the company has worked to simplify the product, reduce the cost	of the technology, and	increase consumer awareness.	 Today, BACtrack offers a wide range of breathalyzers for both personal and professional use, and they are used by consumers, businesses, schools, clinics, hospitals, law enforcement, and even the U.S. military around the world.  DEFINING THE SMARTPHONE REVOLUTION In April, 2013, BACtrack launched the BACtrack Mobile Breathalyzer, the first smartphone breathalyzer to combine professional-grade fuel cell sensor technology, Bluetooth®-connectivity, and app-enabled features. With BACtrack Mobile, users can obtain a BAC result, view safety information and monitor how alcohol affects the body at each BAC point. BACtrack's unique ZeroLine® feature also shows a user approximately how long alcohol will remain in their bloodstream after consumption.  BACtrack released its second smartphone enabled breathalyzer in July, 2014. The BACtrack Vio Smartphone Breathalyzer has many of the same features as BACtrack Mobile, but is packaged in a compact, keychain design. INDUSTRY AWARDS AND RECOGNITION BACtrack's suite of products continue to be recognized by top research and media publications. BACtrack is featured in the 2013 December issue of Popular Science. It received the 2013 Best of What's New Award (Popular Science's top honor) for its innovation in health. Popular Science stated BACtrack and the other award recipients are ""poised to change the world.""  In April 2014, the BACtrack Keychain Breathalyzer and BACtrack Mobile received Car and Driver's highest ratings in an industry wide comparison testing of the most accurate personal breathalyzers. CNET rated BACtrack Mobile as ""very good"" on the usability scale.  In the 2014 Edison Awards, BACtrack Mobile won a Bronze medal for the Security and Safety Category. It also won an Australian Good Design Award for being one of the best designed and most innovative products of the year across a range of fields and industries.  BACTRACK CONSUMPTION REPORT In June 2014, BACtrack was the first company to release alcohol related data to the public concerning US drinking habits via the BACtrack Consumption Report. The report is compiled from Blood	Alcohol	Content	(BAC) data collected anonymously via BACtrack Smartphone Breathalyzers, and will be updated regularly to provide insight into	alcohol	consumption patterns around the world. The goal	is	to	enlighten	the	general	public	on	alcohol	consumption	habits	so	that	 they 	become more responsible	drinkers. RETAIL PARTNERSHIPS BACtrack has forged extensive partnerships around the globe with the major retail and ecommerce stores. BACtrack breathalyzers are carried in over 10,000 retail locations across North America, including Best Buy, Costco, and Walgreen's, and are available at major online retailers such as Amazon, Walmart.com, Brookstone, and Drugstore.com. BACtrack products are also available in over 25 countries and 4 continents.  PRODUCT OFFERINGS The BACtrack product line includes the following: Smartphone Breathalyzers: BACtrack Mobile Smartphone Breathalyzer, BACtrack Vio Smartphone Breathalyzer BACtrack smartphone breathalyzers wirelessly connect to your iOS or Android device via Bluetooth®, and with the free BACtrack app, a user can save, track, and optionally share their BAC results. Professional Series Breathalyzers:  BACtrack S80 Pro, BACtrack S75 Pro, BACtrack Element.  Each of the Professional Series breathalyzers is equipped with the proprietary Xtend Fuel Cell Sensing Technology, which deliver consistent, reliable BAC results with police-grade accuracy, from 0.000 to 0.400% BAC. BACtrack Mobile is also a Professional Series model. Elite Series Breathalyzers:  BACtrack Keychain, BACtrack Go, BACtrack S35.
