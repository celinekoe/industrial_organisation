Even when other vital organs keep working, without brain wave activity, the body is an empty vessel. Modern science understands more about the brain than ever before. For instance, they now know that the brain is plastic — meaning that is can change itself, and does so based on the input it receives. this is called neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity means that they are NOT victims of genetics or limited by an imperfect IQ as once believed. It also means you have the power to create your own success — your own fate, as it were — simply by providing your brain the stimulus it needs to transform you into a mental powerhouse, capable of fashioning any life you desire. There is a growing body of compelling evidence for the supportive role visualization plays in achieving the mind/body connection. Visualization directly influences the body by calming the mind, slowing breathing and heart rate, relaxing muscles and lowering blood pressure, creating an optimal environment for mind/body balance and for radiant good health. BrainTap is a favorite with those who strive for peak performance. With programs to enhance learning, master a sport, get super fit, improve sales performance, or even attain great wealth, BTT provides the right mental rehearsal and mind-set to get there faster and with less effort. Moreover, they are now faced with a new kind of “super-stress” never before seen in human history, and it’s directly linked to their high-tech, overloaded lifestyles. The effects can be devastating, robbing you of good health, energy, mental harmony and the quality of life that is your birthright. Your body is designed to be in a relaxed, healing state most of the time. These days, however, most people spend the better part of their day in stress overload. Your brain copes by generating more high-intensity brain waves and suppressing those that calm and focus you. Once your brain habituates to this stress pattern, it becomes difficult to wind down. You may experience foggy thinking, poor memory, lack of motivation, negative self-talk, difficulty concentrating and low energy—all of which set the stage for unhealthy lifestyle habits such as stress-eating and smoking. Regular use of BrainTap Technology re-balances brain wave activity, allowing your brain to relax, rest and reboot. As you’re guided through various states of consciousness, you can change unwanted behaviors and habits, including those contributing to smoking, poor sleep habits and over-eating, all while helping you feel more relaxed and attentive, energetic, and motivated to succeed. These doctors know that relaxing, rebooting and strengthening busy brains is sure to boost the success of their patients’ regular care plans.","Consumer Electronics, Education, Hardware, Health Care, Software",2,"Nicholas Zaldastani, Patrick Porter",11-50,1,,,,,,USD,,BAMCAP,,1,,Private,,,,,,

Transparency is the guiding principle of our research.

Simply put, there should be absolute clarity on how we gather the data, formulate our analysis and convey the results without any ambiguity or obfuscation.

Because of the pervasive nature of applications in our everyday life, there is a growing demand for accurate, timely and meticulously prepared research reports that quantify, analyze and predict the total available markets for applications.    Definitions Of Applications And Applications Markets We use a fairly broad definition for applications. Applications are software programs and/or presentation layers that enable users to automate a discrete enterprise function. Examples include ERP(Enterprise Resource Planning), general ledger, human resources, manufacturing, order capture, sales and marketing and other back-to-front office functions. For vertical-industry applications, we define them in the similar vein - meaning that these applications are designed to perform any one of the five following functions - back-office, front-office, customer information management, operations and specialized capabilities like Picture Archiving Applications for healthcare providers. Other examples of vertical-industry applications include Fulfillment in Communications, Project Costing in construction, Catering in Leisure and Lodging, Claims Processing in insurance, Point-Of-Sale in retail, Smart Metering Infrastructure in utilities, and Student Information Systems in education.","Apps, Data and Analytics, Design, Information Technology, Internet Services, Sales and Marketing, Software",1,Albert Pang,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

In fact, the COGS can be zero to negative.  Our five-year-old test facility in Ontario, CA takes in 10-20 tons of waste daily and produces 20-25 tons of dried larvae and twice that in frass (organic fertilizer) monthly.    After 8 years and $12 million in friends and family investment, we are ready to move to a larger 'city-sized' facility.  We are roughly break-even in our Ontario test facility (and this is without ever having sold the frass, which has a market value almost equal to the insects themselves, and for which we just received regulatory approval).  The $6mm expansion round that we are looking for willtriple our capacity to 75 tons of dried larvae and 150 tons of fertilizer a month, and make us very profitable.  This puts, us on a path towards debt and equity financings of larger muni- and metro-sized facilities that produce 180 tons and 450 tons of dried larvae per month, respectively.   Vivotein is an extraordinarily impactful company.  We prevent food waste from entering landfills and converting to methane, which is 30x worse than CO2.  Our larvae are a superior substitute for ocean-destroying fishmeal (so we eliminate fishmeal) and deforestation-inducing soy monocropping (we reduce reliance on soybeans). Our fertilizer is organic and prices at a premium, and we produce no waste.  Our children will one day marvel that any organic waste was ever prevented from circulating back into the food chain using the BSFL, nature's apex decomposer.    Vivotein has the leadership, know-how, vision, and waste partnerships to build facilities in every one of the 37 US cities with 500K or more people, and of course we can expand internationally as well. We'd love to schedule a further conversation.  We have a data room with a video virtual tour, our financial model, a cap table, and legal docs.

The system also collects granular data on talent’s responsiveness and on-the-job performance. - The majority world can produce more than just outsourced coders, so we invest in our talent’s own ideas too.

When his father operated their home table saw, a board began to bind, then kicked back, detaching most of his right thumb while he was fumbling to find the “Off” switch. This moment in time was etched in Jack and his father’s minds, and with it came a determination to guard machines properly to avoid these types of accidental injuries. Jack and his father began designing a rough prototype of the new hands-free emergency stop and, over the next number of years, refined their concept. After his father became seriously ill and unable to work, Jack redoubled his efforts and founded his first safety company, ReiTech, in 1994. He then went on to complete the design of the new standardized, hands-free emergency stop control he and his father had worked tirelessly on for so many years. As the company grew, they realized the need for better tools to help guide users through the difficult task of machine inspection and documentation, and with that, Machine Safety Management was formed. With experience in machine safety including Best New Products awards, expert witness testimony, and service on the ANSI B11 19 committee on machine guarding, Machine Safety Management and ReiTech have come to be known as “The Experts in Machine Safety”. Machine Safety Management is built on a passion that cares first for people, is persistent and flexible in finding a solution, and humbly knows that even the most well trained operators need protection.  With decades of machine safety expertise and an unmatched breadth of simple-to-use products and services, Machine Safety Management helps to protect operators and organizations by helping them develop a proactive safety program with properly documented due diligence.","Design, Manufacturing",1,Jack Reiter,11-50,1,Seed,220000,USD,220000,220000,USD,220000,,,,,Private,,,,,,
