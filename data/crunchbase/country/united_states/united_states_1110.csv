They welcome your love and support in their mission of compassion through art. The initial concept of painting for people in hospitals was born in 1975 when John Feight volunteered in Northside Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. The idea to establish the Foundation for Hospital Art developed through years of painting in hospitals and seeing the comfort art gave to the patients, medical staff and visitors. Out of this experience has evolved the firm belief that nothing a hospital can provide in the way of technological and scientific marvels is as supportive as an atmosphere of compassion, both human and aesthetic, in these institutions where they all must spend time - to give birth, to be healed - or for some, to die. The traditional hospital setting is exemplified by white, sterile walls and ceilings. Examining rooms, waiting rooms, corridors - areas where health professionals and other caregivers work, where families and patients wait - are too often colorless, lifeless, and certainly not inviting. The Foundation for Hospital Art was officially established in 1984 and is dedicated to involving patients and volunteers worldwide to create colorful, soothing artwork donated to hospitals to help soften the often stressful hospital experience. Each PaintFest is unique and special, but all are filled with smiles, joy and the common goal of caring about people. NO ARTISTIC EXPERIENCE is necessary. Their technique enables everyone to participate. All you need is a heart to make beautiful things happen.","Community and Lifestyle, Health Care, Other, Social Impact",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

It helps you find the best hotel at the lowest price based on your unique taste. Save Money With FindOptimal, you can compare prices of the same hotel from different online travel agencies (OTA) and the hotel’s own website. We partnered with the largest OTAs on a global basis, including Expedia, Hotels.com, Priceline, Agoda, Booking.com and more. Our partners have the strongest negotiation power to get you the lowest price on the hotels you like. Using FindOptimal, you can get the best of the best without searching all those websites one by one. FindOptimal can save you up to 40% in hotel booking by splitting your multi-night stay into several bookings. Thanks to the contribution of Revenue Management, hotels charge very different rates at different nights. Fortunately, FindOptimal provides you a tool to take that advantage. FindOptimal can retrieve the nightly rates of all booking combinations during your stay and work out the most economic solution for you in several seconds. Save Time What distinguishes us from other hotel search sites is that we facilitate personalized hotel search. With FindOptimal, you can find the hotel that best fits your special taste and budget in the shortest time. FindOptimal has a web app specially designed for mobile. With the FindOptimal mobile app,  you can enjoy the easy and smart hotel searching and booking on the go. Although mobile optimized web sites or mobile apps have become common, many people don’t like to book a hotel with mobile phones. Because the mobile screen is too small, it is not very easy to type and select. FindOptimal minimizes the effort you have to do with your smart phone because it knows all your preferences, given that you have defined them with your home computer before. FindOptimal does all screening and evaluation work before delivering the final results to you. With FindOptimal, searching hotels on your mobile phone is a breeze. Reduce Risks That’s not all. With FindOptimal, you can do hotel search among 1.6 million properties, 37 million rooms worldwide. We leave no stones unturned to make sure you won’t miss any good deals anywhere you travel. FindOptimal covers all large hotel chains and independent properties, from luxury 5 star hotels to budget hostels. We also search vacation rentals including vacation houses, apartments and condo resorts. Additionally, we can find you home style accommodations such as bed & breakfasts and guesthouses too. Booking secret hotels without knowing the hotel identity may save you up to 60%, but it comes with risks.
