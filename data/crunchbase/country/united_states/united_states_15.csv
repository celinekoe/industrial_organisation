We aggregate demographic user data and reorganize it into a clean, user friendly interface that allows users to â€œSocialize Their Vacationâ€ before they ever arrive. Current travel sites use the term â€œsocial travelâ€ but only allow users to share information amongst existing friends. Vacation Relation connects users that have never met before and transforms a virtual connection into a real life relation when they arrive. All communication is done through the user's existing social networks (Facebook and LinkedIn). These conversations combined with statistical data also allow users to plan and book their vacation based on socialistic aspects. This functionality does not exist in the current online travel market. Mission Statement: To provide users with a better overall vacation experience through the use of their existing social media.

Don Beasley and Stephen Hubert were helpful with the accounting and legal systems, Emma Jean Cervantes joined the board and Wanda Bullock, RN served as volunteer nurse. The agency was finally incorporated in 1982 as a private not for profit organization. Medicare certification was achieved in 1984. Community support for a hospice program was evident from the beginning. Furniture and items needed to set up office were donated, and a Venture in Mission grant from St. Andrews Episcopal Church established Mesilla Valley Hospice as a viable program.
