Not only is 3B Medical, Inc. focused on producing high-quality medical technology, but they also help to alter the lives of consumers for the better. With various products to help sleep disorder sufferers (and their significant others!) get a restful night's' sleep, they enjoy being a part of something that promotes a healthy and balanced lifestyle.  Led by co-founders Tom Thayer, President, and Alex Lucio, Executive Vice President, 3B Medical Inc is a growing company in Winter Haven, Florida. Over the past few years, the company has shown double-digit financial growth, plans to create about 30 manufacturing jobs in early 2018 and continues to put in new patents to the FDA. Not only has 3B Medical, Inc. experienced internal growth, but they’ve encountered external development as well. Alex Lucio has taken on a more public role by representing 3B Medical at trade shows, such as the annual American Academy of Sleep Medicine “Sleep” 2017 conference in Boston, and acting as the company spokesman. Alex spoke publicly to a handful of local newspapers including the Florida Business Observer, The Tampa Bay Business Journal, and HomeCare Magazine. In fact, Alex Lucio has shaped 3B Medical’s product portfolio from the company inception, and he continually searches for new and innovative products to bring to market. Not only is he directly responsible for executive management of 3B Medical, but Alex is also accountable for charting 3B Medical’s strategy to position the company as a global leader in the sleep and respiratory space. Under Alex's leadership, 3B Medical Inc was the first company in the world to produce sleep apnea devices that use cloud technology and feature comprehensive compliance and efficacy data reporting. This type of technology was missing from the market, so Alex Lucio and his team jumped at the chance to develop a device that would put his company on the map. After a few years of development, the groundbreaking iCodeConnect™ hit the market. This HIPPA-compliant device reports live data from sleeping patients to doctors in real time, which helps to diagnose and treat sleep apnea in a more efficient manner. Since the release of the iCodeConnect™, Alex Lucio hears a lot of satisfaction from his customers about how getting a restful night’s sleep for the first time was life-changing for them -- and their partners.  Alex Lucio and the 3B Medical team are excited to see what else is ahead for their company in 2018. You can expect to hear more about their interface technologies, which will use silicone gel adhesives to comfortably stick to patients while they rest.",Health Care,1,Alex Lucio,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The Virtual Engagement and Data Analytic System – an interactive live support application hosted on Google Glass (and other devices) was conceived and developed to solve the very specific needs of healthcare facilities & industry suppliers. As equipment, implants, and surgical tools evolved to do more, most of them have also become more complex. Perioperative support for these implants and instruments is further complicated by changing regulations and new industry-wide policies which control and limit the interactions of suppliers and healthcare providers.  A critical issue for manufacturers and suppliers is adapting to industry efforts focused on reducing supplier traffic in operative areas. These changes have made on-site supplier support more difficult, and squarely place the additional burden on doctors, nurses and management.  Remote Reps has designed a Virtual Engagement System that is hosted on Google Glass, and other wearable and mobile devices. The proprietary features not only solve the critical market problem of medical device/technology case coverage in a changing healthcare environment, but delivers added value in other business operations. By providing smart, big data analytics on case coverage instances Remote Reps can revolutionize the way suppliers and facilities view surgical case support.   That potential to provide big data analytics, automated billing and tracking services and best practices consulting is made possible by using our Virtual Engagement System on Google Glass or other hardware.   An integral part of the company’s long term and rapid growth strategy is to leverage remote case observation as a means to provide valuable data and analytics that can improve the efficiency and reliability of supplier’s R&D, manufacturing, and supply chain operations.","Hardware, Health Care, Information Technology",,,1-10,1,,50000,USD,50000,50000,USD,50000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Welcome to Aballoon, the first music collaboration platform, digital record label & mutual fund where artists & fans collaborate and create songs together, and where investors earn money by making this happen. Before getting into the securitization of our music royalties, I’m going to talk about our technology… We’ve built a platform that allows people from all around the globe to collaborate online through the beautiful craft of writing lyrics together, or just by writing and storing their lyrics privately. This platform is built in a way that allows us to develop internal applications like our unique music streaming service and our music encyclopedia, “Aballoopedia”. One of the best things about our platform is that it’s not only an entertainment music website where we distribute our content, it is also a space for creation & collaboration, and it functions like a social network that allows our users to share and dedicate their favorite songs from our catalog; which brings me to the next point… OUR CONTENT During the past 4 years, we’ve managed to discover and polish an outstanding formula to generate music content like no other… We have come up with a music collaboration model that even allows non-musicians to be part of music creation by writing lyrics on our platform and having well-known artists collaborate and create songs out of those lyrics through our record label, Weballooning…  And I know that you’re probably wondering what exactly is Weballooning... Weballooning is the name of our digital record label, which in other words means it is an asset generator!  Weballooning consists of arranging live music sessions where we gather musicians and artists from different bands and have them write and record a song within 48 hours, using some of the lyrics that their fans have posted on our platform. In other words, we’re the first digital record label to produce and sell music written between artists and fans. And believe me when I say that the results are mind-blowing. The sound of the songs is an unprecedented thing. We currently have more than 250,000 monthly listeners on Spotify and YouTube, and over 9.2 million plays with just 12 launched songs, and without any budget for marketing, which takes me to the next and probably the most important thing about this presentation: Music Backed Securities… We’ve already started collecting and managing music royalties out of our current songs catalog but we need liquidity to scale, That’s why after more than 2 decades of having such a financial instrument issued by David Bowie and financial innovator David Pullman, we want to retake the “Bowie Bonds” concept and turn it into the first Music Backed Securities market.  According to Billboard Magazine, Bowie Bonds were ahead of their time however, thanks to the re-emergence of the music industry and the rise of the Blockchain technology, we want to create the first financial market and mutual fund that issues and sells Asset Backed Securities collateralized by pools of songs and/or song derivatives that can serve as a new investment vehicle to be traded in our own platform or even just used as a collectible! We’ve worked and released songs with national and international famous Latin-American artists, and we’re looking to broaden our horizon by reaching out and inviting worldwide music celebrities to collaborate next. We believe that true innovation comes not only from creating great products, but creating a new mindset… That’s why for the first time ever we’re making it possible for non-musicians to be part of music creation, for big artists to collaborate and engage with their fans in a new way, and for investors to be part of the next generation of Music Backed Securities with which they’ll be able to, not only diversify their portfolios and periodically earn yields over long periods of time, but to be part of the creation of amazing music between artists and fans. Because we believe that, if a single mind has been able to create a masterpiece, imagine what we could create all together.
