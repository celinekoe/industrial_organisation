The Ventura Film Festival was founded in 2004 by Jordan Older and has screened hundreds of films, usually over 200 films each summer, and has attracted attention from the international film community.  Some of the highlights have been hosting award winning filmmaker Dylan O’Neil, the first ever world champion surfers Peter “PT” Townend and Ian Cairns, 4 time world champion Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu/MMA fighter Fabio Leopoldo, and the 50th Anniversary of West Side Story, which included hosting the entire Academy Award winning cast of West Side Story, including Academy Award winner/Golden Globe winner George Chakiris and Golden Globe winner/Academy Award nominee Russ Tamblyn. Jordan Older, the Ventura Film Festival founder and executive director, was selected to take part, along with many of Hollywood’s top stars, in the 50th Anniversary of West Side Story and Hollywood’s footprint/handprint ceremony for Academy Award winners Rita Moreno, George Chakiris, and Golden Globe winner Russ Tamblyn at the Chinese Theater in Hollywood.  This event also doubled as the official BluRay release by Fox and MGM of West Side Story, which is widely considered by critics and fans to be the best musical of all time. The Ventura Film Festival is unique.  Not only does the Ventura Film Festival raise awareness for important environmental issues, it also raises money that is donated directly to select non-profit environmental organizations.  So far, the Ventura Film Festival has supported the Surfrider Foundation and Save the Redwoods League as well as donating money to the Ventura County Library.  Even more, the Ventura Film Festival is a 100% volunteer based organization without ever having a single employee or full time staff-member.  Along with an all-star volunteer advisory panel, thousands of volunteers have signed up to produce the largest film festival ever in Ventura County. The Ventura Film Festival is located in Ventura, California, USA which is situated just 60 miles from Hollywood on the Southern California coastline.  The Ventura area boasts near perfect weather and one of the best sunsets in the world.  Ventura and the surrounding area has miles of uncrowded sandy beaches that include some of the most famous surf spots in the world such as the Rincon Point and Ventura County Line.  Within a short drive can be found other popular tourist destinations such as Los Angeles, Malibu, and Santa Barbara. Filmmakers and writers from more than 25 countries have participated in the Ventura Film Festival which screens films in all genres including features, shorts, documentaries, animations, music, and surf films.  The Ventura Film Festival also has a screenplay and teleplay competition.  Film and screenplay submissions are accepted year-round and are free of charge.

Since its inception in 2005, the healthcare software developer has created innovative clinical solutions in treatment planning, delivery and management of brain tumors and other neurological disorders. Treatment planning plays a critical role in maximizing the benefits and minimizing the risks of treatment delivery to the patient. Prism software leverages existing investments in scanners and treatment systems to optimize planning workflow. Prism makes the power of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and advanced physiological sequences practical in the treatment planning process. With Prism, treatment plans based on fMRI and DTI studies deliver treatment that is faster, safer and more effective for the patient. Pre-treatment mapping identifies functional structures to avoid during treatment, enabling physicians to deliver treatment that reduces the risk of post-treatment complications. Prism helps establish critical spatial relationships between the patient's anatomical and functional structures in relation to the physiology and pathology of the patient's condition. This allows the physician to avoid damaging valuable tissue during the course of treatment.",Health Care,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
