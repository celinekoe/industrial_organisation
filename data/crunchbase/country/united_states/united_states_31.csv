There is a process called “network due diligence” that answers the question. “Will my network function at the new building?” The process answers questions about cost, risk mitigation, fail over, and current contract obligations that need to be addressed prior to the move. Timing is critical and should be set in motion no later than 90 days prior to the move. It is better to complete network due diligence, before the lease is signed. Many clients discover, after the lease is signed, that good reliable (affordable) internet connections are not available at the new office. Your current Internet Service Provider may not have adequate service at the new address, so another provider that fits your tolerance for risk and your budget must be selected. Internet Broker: Think of the ISP (internet service provider) as the landlord who wants to “rent” an internet connection to you based on 12, 24, or 36 month terms. All enterprise grade bandwidth pricing can be adjusted based on competing offers. An Internet Broker can gather competing offers and actually drive your monthly costs lower. The Internet Broker receives a commission from the ISP a free service to the client. Cabling: A free evaluation will help determine the type and quantity of cables needed for your new office. Space can be listed as “plug and play” with cabling already installed. It is in your best interest to have the cabling tested. The space may have been divided, and the landlord does not keep records on, or guarantee installed cabling. Network Move Management: This is a service that allows you to outsource the entire network move operation. Several companies are part of the network move. Cabling, Phone, IT, Riser Management, one or more Internet Service Providers.

What better credentials would a manufacturer of mining equipment need? In other words, they have ""been there and done that."" They understand the inner workings of mining equipment first hand because they have ""hands on"" experience that some manufacturers may lack. That speaks well for  the quality of equipment Johnson Industries manufactures and explains the unsullied reputation they have earned over the years. Johnson Brothers Coal Company was established in 1974 by five Johnson brothers - Greg, Garla, Gwendel, Garnie, and George, all coming from different walks of life, but all with an innate ability to think and create. Their ability to design innovative solutions to the challenges they faced on the job paid off. The Kinney Branch Company that Garnie supervised became the highest ton per man hour coal producer in the United States. A  back injury shortened George's coal mining life, but maybe it was a ""blessing in disguise,"" because after that he devoted his time to design and production. In 1981, they established Johnson Industries and immediately started manufacturing the industrial duty car, followed by the Super Low Tail Piece. A patented laser alignment tool for the underground mining industry (Slimm-Jim Laser) was developed next and it quickly gained industry acceptance. Johnson Industries' next proud accomplishment was the Stinger - an MSHA permissible and explosion proof personnel carrier that became a top seller in the industry. One rugged product after another has emerged from Johnson Industries, with each piece proving increased efficiency and improved safety.","Manufacturing, Natural Resources, Transportation",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The question was asked of whether the properties of this tree could be transferred to other plants to improve their growth and health. Seven years and hundreds of trials later, the answer appears to be that yes, the properties of this amazing tree can be transferred to other applications, with resulting benefits in plant growth, vitality, and yield.
