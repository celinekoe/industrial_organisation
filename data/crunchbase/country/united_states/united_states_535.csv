What separates us from other MBSE resources is that they offer tool specific training. They provide more than just integration, as they supplement the tool vendors in training and mentoring. They don’t just offer courses in SysML alone. They are focused and dedicated to helping systems engineers do SysML in the actual modeling tool. They provide instruction on SysML for IBM Rational Rhapsody, NoMagic's Cameo Systems Modeler™, and PTC Integrity Modeler, so that people will know how to use the tool and apply the language. In addition, they are committed to building tools to help SysML to be more palatable to systems engineers. Rather than using a particular tool straight out of the box, the user can come to MBSE Solutions to help them automate all of the things that must happen in the language, and allow them to merely click the desired items and draw out the system. All the language will automatically happen behind this. MBSE Solutions is uniquely adapted to helping users create their own domain specific language profile for their industry and needs.

This technology, unlike any other biodiesel producer in the U.S., allows CIBDO to process incoming feedstock at a significant cost savings to other feedstocks in existence. Our supplier of this ultra low priced feedstock is one of the world's largest agriculture companies and Fortune 100 members, Archer Daniels Midland. The 5½ million gallons per year of feedstock that ADM has agreed to supply CIBDO will be priced at 1/3 to 1/2 less than the cost of other feedstock used by the competition. In addition to supplying feedstock, ADM has also given us the option to sell the resulting biodiesel product back to them.  We will be strategical located within a few miles of the ADM facility in Decatur, IL and within hours of two major metropolitan areas, Chicago and St. Louis.  Lastly, the management team has spent over five years developing the technology and has processed all types of feedstock into fuel-grade finished biodiesel. We seek $375,000 to complete the first round of financing; it will be in the form of preferentially-treated equity. This, together with the $2,600,000 already committed in the form of hard assets and IP, will allow the company to construct a biodiesel plant in Decatur and begin producing biodiesel for immediate sale into the petroleum diesel market. In terms of the ""big picture"", management will focus on getting the Decatur location operational, building a supply chain and distribution channels, all while increasing cash flow.  As that is being accomplished, the company will consider various expansion options.  These options may include, but are not limited to, acquiring or building plant(s) near other vegetable oil refineries as well as near ethanol production locations so as to process their corn oil.  Once the company can present a credible deployment picture, it will consider various liquidation options at that time.","Energy, Natural Resources, Professional Services, Sustainability, Transportation",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
