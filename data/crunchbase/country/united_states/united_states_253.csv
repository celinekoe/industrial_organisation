They focus on making your social media presence count.  Through strategic community development & brand reputation management, influencer outreach, fan engagement, core messaging and competitor monitoring they are able to bring your company to the front of the social network class. Why does this matter to your business? You tell us! Every business has their own reasons for wanting to get their brand on social media. Lots of them try, and unfortunately fail. Why? Usually because the person or people handling the social media profiles for the company were inexperienced at digital marketing. They thought all they needed was a Twitter handle and a Facebook page. But then what? They know the tools, tricks, hacks, backdoors, tactics and ‘rules of engagement’ that make social media campaigns sing. An intern with a SnapChat account and 500 Instagram followers doesn’t mean he’s a digital marketer. It takes tried and true marketing know-how and experience to reap the benefits of social media. Boldly Social develops short-term campaigns and long-term relationships. Their campaigns are intended to impact a specific business goal – not guarantee you 10,000 new (and completely unqualified) social media fans or followers. They strive for quality over quantity.  Aim. Fire. Hit your target.","Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Sales and Marketing",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Emmetrope, despite its size, now has best in class movement and stability of effect. Their final push toward the ultimate accommodative lens is about to begin. Computer modeling with finite element analysis demonstrates that their ActaLens platform, in its two layer embodiment, will yield a shape-change lens that offers over three diopters of accommodation. They are seeking series A financing to model, produce and clinically test this next generation shape change lens as well as take their first generation lens through CE mark and launch.
