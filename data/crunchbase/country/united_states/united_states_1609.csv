The company was started as Vantage Technology, a name which it held for the first 18 years of its existence.  The genesis of the company was the realization by founder and CEO Ann Deters that many more hospitals and surgeons would be able to provide the latest in cataract surgery technology to their communities if there were an alternative to expensive ophthalmic medical equipment, instrument and disposable supply purchases.  Nearly two decades later, that original vision is still the heart of Vantage's mission, but the company has grown over the years to offer a full complement of eyecare services, including supplying everything needed to efficiently and cost-effectively conduct eye-related surgeries â€” from the surgeon's choice of intraocular lenses, ophthalmic instruments, and surgical disposables, to the services of a trained technician to help the operating room staff.  Vantage Outsourcing has expanded its company goal of providing ophthalmic medical equipment to sharing the equipment with several facilities. This has worked to alleviate costs and eliminate capital investments for many surgery centers. Vantage has saved the healthcare industry over $60 million in capital costs.  Vantage Outsourcing, renamed in 2009 to better reflect its mission of providing a host of outsourced services, currently works with more than 150 clients in the Midwest, North, South, East and Southeast regions from its home office in Effingham, Illinois and 10 satellite locations.","Health Care, Professional Services",,,11-50,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The first patent issued by USPTO January 2013, five additional patents issued in 2013 with more patent-pending.  The patents describe materials within a new class of materials called covetics, where carbon at the nano-scale is infused and bonded with base metals and their alloys in a single phase which cannot be separated by re-melting.  The nanocarbon bonding allows tailoring of the finished covetic by adjusting carbon content and post processing to enhance the properties of the base metal such as conductivities, durability, and corrosion resistance.  The first $5M investment in TM2 was used to secure composition of matter patents, to develop production procedures and robotics for repeatable control, to setup a studio/research lab (in Dayton, OH), and to develop an understanding of the “covetic” bond and the properties of covetics (first peer-reviewed paper submitted November 2013 by University of Maryland under Academic Research License from TM2).  Market research has been performed in numerous industries following the traditional metals segments of copper, silver, gold and aluminum as well as analysis of the nanocarbon markets concentrating on graphene, CNTs and other carbon allotropes.  Covetics have been shown to contain sp2 and sp3 nanocarbon structures and graphene-like nanoribbons, which enhance many properties of the base metal.  Enhanced properties of covetics, when fully developed, will replace metals in many applications.  Silver covetics, for instance, is very easy to work with, casts into finer part geometry, hardens beyond pure silver without alloying and resists tarnish well beyond fine silver.  Copper covetics can carry much higher current density, with higher tensile strength and resists corrosion better than pure copper.  Capital to acquire production equipment to apply covetics into specific products is being raised.",Manufacturing,,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
