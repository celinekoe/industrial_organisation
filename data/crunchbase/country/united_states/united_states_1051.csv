Unlike other so-called 'smart calendars,' Mynd Calendar's sophisticated algorithms identify the places you're going within the content of your calendar events and accurately predict (even in advance) how much buffer time you need to schedule between meetings given the typical traffic at that time of day.  As you get closer to your appointments, Mynd Calendar tells you when to leave, based on current traffic conditions and launches your favorite navigation app to get you to your appointment on time.   Mynd Calendar also: -Notifies you when you're running late and lets you easily email, call or text the people who need to know from within the calendar. -Automatically identifies conference call numbers and facilitates easy, one-click dial-in. -Discovers the people listed in your calendar events and looks up their LinkedIn profiles and information from your address book, so you know who you’re meeting with and can get in touch with them directly from your calendar. -Pulls in your relevant Evernote notes so that you're always prepared for your next meeting. -RSVP to meeting invites. -Tells you the weather at both where you are and where you're going.","Events, Media and Entertainment, Mobile, Software",3,"Max Wheeler, Scott Putterman, Tony Robinson",1-10,1,Seed,1525000,USD,1525000,1525000,USD,1525000,"SAP Concur, Tugboat Ventures",,2,,Private,,,,,,

FICO scores are a mystery to most people. Precision is a consumer advocate dedicated to educating those that can benefit most from a thorough understanding of the credit scoring system. Consumers obviously have much to gain including; lower interest rates on mortgages, auto loans or credit cards. Whether or not you’re eligible for employment can often rely on your credit score as well. Secondly, those involved in real estate transactions also benefit from increased knowledge of the FICO score. Mortgage brokers, real-estate agents, lenders, investors, and title representatives all have something to gain from a client with optimal credit. Credit scores determine eligibility for loans. With tightening lending guidelines, credit scores are increasingly important in determining whether or not a deal gets done.","Financial Services, Lending and Investments",,,1-10,1,,,,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Hovercraft can transport higher payloads, with less horsepower and fuel, than any other mechanized craft.  There are no other powered vehicles that provide the versatility of hovercraft … OR THE FUN! HW will initiate operations as the only hovercraft dealer of hovercraft in the State of Florida through exclusive dealership relationships with the two of the three leading recreational hovercraft manufacturers in North America.  HW has formed relationships with two of these entities effectively ‘rolling up’ two thirds of the domestic competition and the largest manufacturer in the United Kingdom and is in position to build and dominate the market for Personal Hovercraft. The US market for their hovercraft overlaps three segments of the Power Sports market, Personal Watercraft (Jet Skis), Snowmobiles and All Terrain Vehicles, in addition to segments of the Recreational Boat market. These segments generate approximately $4 billion in annual sales. Jet Skis and Snowmobiles are the most applicable segments. Jet Skis and Snowmobiles generated US sales of $987 million in 2013. HW will initially focus on these market segments by being the first to raise awareness of the fun, excitement and utility found by owning a Personal Hovercraft. For the last thirty years there has been no serious new product introductions in the Power Sports market. HW intends to fully invigorate this market. The Company initiated an Offering of its Units in a Private Placement Memorandum dated September 2, 2014.
