The thing is we don’t do just animation, because we really care about producing a video for you that will be most effective, not only in explaining your product, but actually making viewers understand what it’s about and how it can be useful for them and entertain them so that they associate your product with a positive feeling. Don’t forget that your video is often the first thing a viewer sees of your product and sometimes the only, so you need to make a good first impression. You’re probably already familiar with all the advantages of having a great web video, like an increase in user conversion or the higher ranking of youtube videos by google, so I’m not going to bore you. Long story short, our biggest cost is in analysing your product to pinpoint exactly how it is special and attractive and then to add lots of creativity and a little madness to make your video truly unique and fresh.
