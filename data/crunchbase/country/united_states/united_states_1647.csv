Youâre probably already familiar with all the advantages of having a great web video, like an increase in user conversion or the higher ranking of youtube videos by google, so Iâm not going to bore you. Long story short, our biggest cost is in analysing your product to pinpoint exactly how it is special and attractive and then to add lots of creativity and a little madness to make your video truly unique and fresh.
