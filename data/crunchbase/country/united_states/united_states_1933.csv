The Internet has become the major catalyst for global economic growth. While Internet technologies have done much to extend a company's reach — eliminating the boundaries of time and place and enabling people to exchange information in real time from anywhere in the world — they have yet to enable the Net to live up to its promise as the most powerful channel for ebusiness. It's true that new ebusiness applications are changing business models by enabling highly personalized marketing, online purchasing, and customer self-service. But the voice of the Net remains almost singular while each of your global markets is comprised of customers that speak their own language; have distinctive cultures, tastes, and buying habits; and are subject to their own unique laws. Therefore, the success of your ebusiness initiatives depends directly upon your ability to communicate efficiently and effectively with your worldwide customers, partners, suppliers as well as your own employees. What remains, then, is a serious challenge for ebusiness: to create a digital world in which your customers worldwide enjoy the same quality of experience regardless of language, culture, or national identity.

This limits the amount of time that your post is online for users to see. When the time limit you set has expired, the post will be deleted from your profile, the feed, and from our servers. Bitzy can be thought of as an interesting blend between Snapchat and Instagram, allowing you to send expiring posts to many followers at once. Bitzy allows you to see what's happening right now in people's lives. Honestly, do you really care that your friend went on a Caribbean cruise four years ago? Now you can see in real-time what your peeps are up to. Bitzy cleans up the old news once the time limit expires, keeping your feed more current and up-to-date. Your future boss does not need to know about that crazy night in Vegas (it happens) or who you voted for in the last election. Who wants to be reminded of those times shared with an ex? I mean, they're an ex for a reason, right? Bitzy's dynamic atmosphere changes as quickly as the events in your life. With Bitzy's impermanent feed, these unfortunate circumstances are MUCH less likely to occur. Bitzy provides a safe, mobile atmosphere where you can be yourself.

Posting a Public Bit allows everyone to see your post. Posting a private Bit allows only mutual followers to see your post. Mutual followers are users who follow you AND who you follow. This ensures your Bit is only viewable to those who you're most comfortable sharing with. We welcome your questions and feedback! Don't blink or you'll miss something!

SoMo will launch peer-to-peer lending nationwide in 2013. In 2010 the founder of SoMoLend, Candace Klein, began a micro-lending program matched with a women’s only, training-based program for participants to earn funding for their start-up companies. There were start-ups that were not able to attain funding through this specific program, and it became apparent that small businesses everywhere needed an advocate. The idea for SoMoLend came from this realization and the desire to assist start-ups that were not able to gain funding through the program. SoMoLend was founded in 2011 to serve small businesses that are not being served by traditional funding. SoMoLend was created on the principal of communities and people helping each other out: people investing in people. We strive as a company to assist local businesses, help entrepreneurs to grow, and allow lenders to invest in the companies and ideas they believe in most. Small businesses create jobs and support local communities, but are struggling to get the support they need; this is where SoMoLend steps in!",Financial Services,1,Candace Klein,101-250,5,Seed,3680000,USD,3680000,4225000,USD,4225000,"CincyTech, North Coast Ventures, QED Investors, Blue Chip Venture Company, Skandalaris Center for Interdisciplinary Innovation and Entrepreneurship",2,8,,Private,,,,,,

CREATE CURRENT YIELD:  ● Pursue a disciplined investment strategy of creating Cash‐Yielding Rental Assets, with the goal of  achieving:  ► 10‐12% cash yield within 18 months of acquisition  ► Overall returns of 2.0x equity and a 20% IRR  ► 2/3 of overall return from current cash yield  2. SPECIFIC ASSET FOCUS:  ● From 2010 to 2014 L‐A exclusively pursued Value‐Add Rental Assets:  ► Multifamily  ► Credit Retail  ► Urban Retail/Multifamily Mixed‐Use  ► Limited Service Hospitality  ● L‐A specifically excluded assets that were back‐end weighted, because these asset types did not have the Cash‐Flow downside protection that rental assets have.  ► Residential Resort; Speculative Land Assemblages; Large Scale Development  3. VALUE‐ADD EXECUTIONS:  ● Current yield is too expensive to purchase. Lubert‐Adler utilizes value‐add strategies with strong  local partners for multifamily and urban executions, together with national specialists for retail and  hospitality.  ● Value‐Add Executions Include:  ► Renovations  ► Repositionings  ► Redevelopments  ● Finally, L‐A focuses on prime mid‐size assets ($25m-$75m) that can generate higher margins due  to their execution requirements, as well as being too large for local operators and too small for larger  Funds.  4. DOWNSIDE PROTECTION:  ● Lubert‐Adler is focused on creating downside protection:  ► Redevelopments are targeted to be 2/3rds the cost of its competitive set  ► Targeted margins must be sufficient to offset an expected rise in interest rate",Real Estate,2,"Dean Adler, Ira Lubert",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

These reviews and votes can be cast from the site's iPhone app or from the service's homepage. The homepage also features a stream of the latest comments to come in from other users, as well as a profile for each restaurant in the system that includes all of its votes and comments. There's also a nifty feature that lets you view a heatmap of your current region, so you can quickly figure out the hot spots in town. The gameplay in GraffitiGeo gives you points for checking into certain locations, similar to [FourSquare](/organization/foursquare), but doesn't really let you do anything with them. With GraffitiGeo, you earn points for every action you take, be it voting on a restaurant or leaving a brief comment. Once you've reached a certain point threshold, you can use those points to start a ""mob"", which you can invite your friends to join. Mobs allow friends to pool their points, which can then be used to acquire territory, which corresponds to actual city blocks. Whenever someone votes on one of the restaurants on the block, the mob gets some street cred too. It's definitely going to be confusing at first, but it also brings a team element to gameplay.","Hardware, Software",3,"Jared Tame, Nikhil Pandit, Teng Siong Ong",1-10,2,M&A,20000,USD,20000,20000,USD,20000,Y Combinator,1,1,,Private,,,,,,
