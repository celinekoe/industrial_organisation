Concise real-time advisories and intelligence reports keep TerrorMate users continuously informed as events unfold.

TerrorMate’s unique location-sharing feature allows users to view a map displaying actual locations of friends and family in real time. T-Chat helps users safely and effectively message loved ones and receive prompt replies during an extreme incident.
