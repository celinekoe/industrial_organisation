Scientists continued to work independently after the completion of the program, founding what would become Martek Biosciences. Martek becomes a leader in microalgae research and development and its research soon identified a special type of Crypthecodinium cohnii algae that produces very high levels of DHA omega-3 fatty acid. In 2011 Martek was acquired by DSM a leading global supplier of both marine and unique vegetarian-based omega-3 ingredient solutions. The Brain Armor line is born.

By combining business resources with business networking, FiredUpNetwork goes beyond what other social networks offer and makes the search for new career opportunities easier and more convenient. It is a one-stop-shop for professional change.  SEEKING CHANGE FiredUpNetwork is an all-inclusive resource for people seeking professional change, or Change Seekers, organized around five Resource Sections:     1. Employment Opportunities    2. Entrepreneurial Pursuits    3. Buy or Sell A Business    4. Fundraising    5. Post-Graduate Education  As a Change Seeker, your first move will likely be reaching out to people in your network to share your ideas and seek counsel.  In response, they will introduce you to people and recommend books and resources that may be of help to you.  Each of FiredUpNetworkâ€™s Resource Sections mirrors this process via three subsections including:     1. Resources    2. Recommended Reading    3. Discussion Boards   THE RESOURCES   The FiredUpNetwork team researched and added 1,500 informational items to the Resource Sections before officially launching.  They are designed in a wiki-like format that allows users to rate, comment and add their own information items to the knowledge base.  As such, the quantity and quality of information will grow and improve as the FiredUpNetwork community expands.  A sampling of the resources includes: headhunting firms organized by industry, business incubation firms organized by state, business brokerage and auction websites, angel networks and venture capital firms that specialize in seed and early stage investments, graduate test preparation courses and much more. THE NETWORK FiredUpNetwork is not limited to Change Seekers.  Change Facilitators are an integral part of the network as well. For example, FiredUpNetwork connects  There are three primary ways to develop new contacts on FiredUpNetwork:     1. Interact with members in the resource sections where you can connect via your common interests;    2. Search the entire member database by many different parameters, e.g. location, university affiliation, profession and reasons for which a member joined FiredUpNetwork.  Follow this by introducing yourself with a request to get FiredUp; and    3. Tap into your Extended Network to connect with those who are two degrees of separation away from you.   FiredUpNetwork will be particularly useful to you as you build your career.   It is our goal to constantly improve the site as members comment, rate and add their own resources. Together we can build the most useful resource and professional networking hub on the web.  Your suggestions will be both appreciated and embraced (see the â€œSuggestionsâ€ link at the top when you are logged in).

The mediafeedia technology-platform enables businesses and other organizations to effectively and efficiently manage their social network assets. mediafeedia, via its Software as a Service (SaaS) model, provides its users an online interface dashboard, which becomes the single point from which subscribers manage the content of one or multiple social media assets. Included in the feature set is the ability for the business or other organization to schedule content in advance (hours, days, weeks, months). This feature gives service subscribers complete content management as well as oversight and audit control of Facebook™ postings, thereby diminishing the opportunity for erroneous, fraudulent or careless releases. Additionally, organizations benefit from a time savings as posts can be created in advance when it is most convenient for them to do so and then these posts will be delivered to Facebook™ fans at times determined by the organization to be most optimal.  Organizations that select the paid version of mediafeedia are able to custom-brand their posts on Facebook™, complete with a clickable link to the organization’s Website or other Web accessible digital assets.  The mediafeedia dashboard also enables the business to have team members easily and safely collaborate on content publishing on the organization’s social media properties. The suite of services offered through the mediafeedia platform is very powerful yet affordable and easy to use. Through the use of mediafeedia, organizations are empowered to attract, engage and reward their most loyal customers, fans and followers while saving time and money.  Since the introduction of its dashboard in January 2011 and without any sales or marketing expenditures to date, over 20,000 users have signed up for mediafeedia’s free service plan to manage over 160,000 Facebook™ fan pages.","Advertising, Professional Services, Sales and Marketing, Software",2,"Justin VanBogart, Peter Buonaiuto",11-50,1,,575000,USD,575000,575000,USD,575000,,,,,Private,,,,,,
