Neurons and Synapses are represented by Polymorphic Object Oriented Multidimensional Map Space and Connection Vectors respectively. This Neural Network includes a Cortex for each type of abstract data becoming an Unsupervised Learning Convolutional Network. This constantly growing group of datasets become A.I.L.E.E.N.N.'s knowledgebase and every time a specific synapse is accessed it glows on a 3D working model representing the process of active thinking by exciting the neurons of a certain synapse in multiple abstaction layers autonomously. A.I.L.E.E.N.N. appears to be conscious when inputs of any kind are compared against it's neural network, matching and identifying with Fuzzy Logic algorithms and self-learning new patterns as unknown datasets are presented and analyzed by each one of the Cortexes. This identification of patterns along with specific rules, pre-set objectives, directives, accuracy and restriction parameters are used to identify any desired optimum working area. A.I.L.E.E.N.N. then presents recommendations, predictions, corrective actions and feedback as a closed loop control system but talking human language, thus, effectively showing the behavior of Artificial Intelligence. The polymorphic nature of A.I.L.E.E.N.N.'s Object Oriented Inheritance layers under unsupervised learning enable the processing of any pattern of any size and any dimension. Storing references, concepts, types, properties, values, 3D datasets, stereo images, audio, statistics, characteristics and classes all with inheritance properties in a polymorphic multidimensional abstract layers allows A.I.L.E.E.N.N. to receive, store, compare and identify datasets of any kind against it's current knowledge in memory and compare it to overtime and realtime behavior samples. This means that any given input like images, letters, numbers, words, paragraphs, sounds, video, contexts, trends and any dataset is learned, analyzed, identified and can be identified,  predicted and controlled by A.I.L.E.E.N.N.  The way this is achieved is by unleashing the processing power of multiple CPU and GPU cloud based clusters using multithreaded parallel processing on the code implementation and providing virtually infinite memory space for A.I.L.E.E.N.N.'s Brain to function over Cloud Based distributed processes and storage. A.I.L.E.E.N.N. is the next step for technology evolution, it's created as a result of applying many years of multidisciplinary expertise and the latest technology all this while thinking outside ANY box.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Consumer Electronics, Data and Analytics, Hardware, Science and Engineering, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
