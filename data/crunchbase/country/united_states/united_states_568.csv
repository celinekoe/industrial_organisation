The Principals of Topstone each have more than 15 years experience operating on a large scale in this space, at various times owning and managing hundreds of single family homes in a scattered sites around economically developing cities. Cities are chosen often because they are at the tipping point of the redevelopment cycle, which although not guaranteed will often result in value increase to properties in the portfolio in additional to higher than average returns generated from the cash flow from rent collections.    Investor’s funds are estimated to be held for 2-3 years. Alternatively investors may continue to retain their position for upwards of 5 years or more. The homes will be found and purchased through current Multiple Listing Service listings, approaching off-market owners, banks, private lenders, wholesalers, brokers and utilizing social media & digital marketing campaigns.     Extensive research has been done to identify markets where the demand for subsidized housing in relation to the population of that city is particularly high. Additional research also confirm that the demand for subsidized housing units far exceeds the available supply. These markets are ripe for investment as affordable housing tenants are unable to find landlords who are willing to supply homes to program voucher holders.
