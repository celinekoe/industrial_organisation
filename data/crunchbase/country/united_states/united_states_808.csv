In 1998, Mixnet was the first vendor in the Commonwealth of Virginia to provide a web-based instrument and image software application mxCourt — for remote access to Circuit Courts. Mixnet has scanned and converted various document library deposits (e.g. circuit courts, medical research, European Union library in Luxembourg etc.) into online digital search and retrieval applications via the Mixnet mxCourt software. The mxCourt application is growing daily and is hosting over 1 million documents that can be searched and accessed online via subscription and transaction based services. Starting in 2003, Mixnet has provided an online tax preparation and e-file platform that enables tax payers to electronically self prepare and file or efile their federal and state taxes return through the self preparation tax platform. Mixnet is working with various partners to comply with the standards set by the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) and the participating state tax agencies. Security, accuracy, and speed are essential for this valuable application. In 2013 Mixnet  expanded the existing mxCourt court document, efile, index, remote access and backfile integration application into a paperless SaaS court application. The upgraded mxCourt version is completely paperless and enables circuit courts and others to manage all court related documents. mxCourt allows legal professionals, land record title researchers etc. to efile court documents and instruments via the mxCourt SaaS computing application. Indexing and document sharing is all done online and the court offices only need internet access and a browser to manage all court instruments. No software or hardware investment is required by the participating court since fees only apply when court documents are efiled. ",Internet Services,,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
