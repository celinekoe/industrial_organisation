Human-centered design is an approach to interactive services, products and systems, research, design, development and management that aims to make them usable and useful by focusing on all the users, their needs and requirements, and by applying human factors/ergonomics and usability knowledge and techniques. This approach enhances effectiveness and efficiency, improves human well-being, user satisfaction, accessibility and sustainability; and counteracts possible adverse effects of use on human health, safety and performance.

As the planet’s leading 501(c)(3), non-profit, non-partisan scientific strategy skunkworks, WIN enjoys being honored even further as a credentialed NGO.  In fact, earth’s only NGO with a cyber focus. Since 1989, WIN has proudly deployed its battle-hardened SOLUTIONneering™ Formula, WIN’s very own painstakingly produced proprietary methodology.  While rooted-in-rigor, the innovation-infusing, problem-pouncing, silo-smashing, bias-blitzing, obsolescence-avoiding, chaos-conquering, and future-forecasting SOLUTIONneering™ Formula destructively diminishes and disrupts detrimental and deleterious #DeEvolution.  By doing so, WIN successfully executes challenging #MissionsThatMatter by #ConnectingTheThoughts in Outer-Space, Cyber-Space, and Neuro-Space (AI). To defend the U.S. and our people, enterprises, and allies, WIN masterfully matches the world’s #MarketsToMakers by #SwitchingThePitch and #ConnectingTheThoughts.  This 180-degree flip from the faulty traditional “build it and they might come” entrepreneurial myth paves the way for WIN to successfully solve U.S.’s toughest and roughest problems…with Earth’s strongest and smartest innovators. Above all, WIN remains obsessively and unapologetically laser-focused on protecting individuals and enterprises from even the earliest infectious signs and symptoms of economy-killing scourges.  These plagues include creativity-chasms, catatonic-complacency, cognitive-collapse, chaotic-catastrophes, innovation-insolvency, de-evolutionary-despair, start-up-non-starters, paradigm-paradoxes, unagile-agility, and, most dangerous, idea-idiocracy. By safeguarding US innovation, the World Innovation Network, in turn, protect our U.S. homeland, our U.S. health, and ultimately…. our U.S freedom.",Professional Services,1,Robert Katz,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
