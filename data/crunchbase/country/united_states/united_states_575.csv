For over 30 years, Californiaâs Technology and Healthcare Executives have relied on ABLâs CEO Round Tables, through its peer advisory-board approach, to accelerate their corporate and professional growth and help them build great companies. In monthly, confidential sessions, ABLâs professional facilitators assure that Members are updated on the latest âbest general business practices,â and enable the Members to leverage one anotherâs business savvy, as they apply lessons from the Group to their most pressing concerns. ABL supports the needs of its top-level Member Executives â the CEOs, Presidents, COOs, and Division GMs of venture-backed, privately held, and publicly traded companies â by providing them with a collegial setting in which to draw on the experience, knowledge and skill sets of their peers, who are in non-competitive sectors of the technology and healthcare industries. Leveraging ABLâs unique, industry-specific approach, Members share âWhatâs Keeping Them Up Nightsâ in the Round Tables, and gain feedback from each other on how theyâre dealing (or have dealt) with those same issues. Together, ABL Members accelerate their real-time learning about how their peers are taking advantage of their industryâs emerging opportunities (and dodging its challenges), by: Sharing experiences; Learning new approaches; Rethinking their assumptions; Exploring opportunities; and Forging business relationships. Traits ABL Members have in common are: -A desire to grow their organizations more successfully -Recognition that fast-changing environments wonât allow for yesterdayâs solutions to solve todayâs (let alone tomorrowâs) problems -An openness to adapting approaches to their own firms that are working in other organizations, frequently very different from their own. Through this process, thereâs an out-flowing of insights, ideas, and introductions, leveraging each Memberâs time and investment. The broad spectrum of ABL Technology Members include the CEOs of licensed and cloud-based software and systems, hardware, B2B and B2C tech products, e-commerce, website design, SEO, and hosting, managed services and systems integration, 3D printing, instrumentation, engineering, optics, imaging, photonics, data and communications companies, tech-enabled manufacturers, and more. ABLâs Technology Round Tables are currently offered in Orange County, West Los Angeles, and the Downtown Los Angeles Area. The breadth of ABL Healthcare Members include leaders of non-profit, proprietary, publicly-traded, and governmental organizations. ABLâs Healthcare Round Tables are currently offered throughout California, in: San Diego, Orange County, Los Angeles, San Francisco, the East Bay, and Sacramento.","Information Technology, Professional Services",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Sleeping On Air,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sleeping-on-air,"Business Development, Business Information Systems, Business Intelligence","Portland, Oregon, United States",Retailing is not dead! The Mattress business is thriving and is mostly recession proof.,"2,007,547","West Coast, Western US",Less than $1M,Active,1994-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,http://www.sleepinginairports.net,"Retailing is not dead! The Mattress business is thriving and is mostly recession proof, and is a business that still depends mostly on brick and mortar locations to be successful: The first, most-important thing to know about a mattress is, Do you like how it feels? This year, one Mattress Retailer of Specialty Beds will top a billion dollars in revenue with no significant competition. If you want this unique mattress technology--this billion dollar technology--for all practical purposes,  you have only one place to go. More than 90% of this company's sales come from their Retail Stores. In the Portland, OR area, there are four stores in a fairly tight geographic region. These four stores should produce in excess of ten million dollars in revenue. (All figures and estimates taken from quarterly SEC filings). This market is ripe for one or two strong, properly-focused competing stores; DIRECT COMPETITORS, not conventional Mattress Stores that sell """"ordinary"""" brands and products, or who merely dip their toe in with one or two """"me too"""" products. That will be Sleeping On Air. This company sells an excellent, high profit-margin product, but there are  a few places where their business model is lacking. For example, dictated prices means no price negotiation, making them vulnerable to price competition from savvy, similar-product competitor. And all their mattresses are made-to-order; it takes up to two-weeks to get a bed. This makes them vulnerable to an In-stock, fast-delivery competitor.  They are also weak on after-the-sale service. A more nimble competitor could out-perform them easily, making unhappy customers very impressed with your service. This is a fantastic opportunity, with a realistic chance to grab 15% of the local market share in the first year, by providing comparable quality both faster and cheaper.The goal is to open one Sleeping On Air Store first, with a second location in 9-12 months. Recouping total investment in 12-18 months is very realistic.","Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Professional Services",,,1-10,1,,,,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
