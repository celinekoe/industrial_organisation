The company offers a wide product selection, competitive prices, a powerful but easy-to-use website, extremely rapid fulfillment times, and a dedicated customer service team. The admin site provides a web view into the heavy-duty database that stores all company data: from the contents of customer shopping carts all the way up to multi-year revenue reports. This tool is not only extremely powerful, but also very flexible. Admin users have the ability to work mostly independently, since all the tools they need to do their work are in one easy-to-access place. And since every staff member gets their own unique login, can be tracked throughout their day, and can perform management tasks like tracing mistakes and performance evaluation, through the auditing tools provided by the system. The executives or all-level access users, get the benefit of large-scale, aggregate reports which provide up-to-the-minute information about sales, inventory turnover, outstanding invoices, customer accounts, product popularity, expenses, and much more. The most notable advantage provided by this system is the real-time nature of its database. Because everything is tied together into a single, unified system, everything occurs instantly. For example, if a customer sends an email query about their order 30 seconds before it ships out the door, the mail server picks up the message and attaches it to the order in the database. The fulfillment rep will see this appear on their screen and can take action to adjust the order as appropriate, right then and there.",Commerce and Shopping,2,"Adam Wiggins, Jedi Wright",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The goal of the organization is to extend a large volume of animal data, showing excellent efficacy in neurodegenerative models, to the modeled human diseases. Possible lead indications for which there are proof of concept data: Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer’s and/or Parkinson’s Disease, Central Nervous System Injuries, and Seizure Disorders. There is very limited industry progress for the above indications. The current treatments for MS relapse are by injection with no long term benefit for neurodegeneration and disability and highly variable safety profiles. No combined anti-inflammatory or aggregate disposal therapies are presently available for neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, or Huntington’s diseases. CHECs are unique because they target all the principal cellular pathologies in degenerative diseases (inflammation, cell death, protein aggregation) in an orally available formulation.    Company advisors are Timothy Cunningham, Ph.D., who discovered and isolated the compounds, and Jeffrey Greenstein, M.D., who is a neurologist/immunologist that will supervise clinical applications. The peptides are protected by issued US patents and several patent applications.     CHEC PR takes a flexible position for selection of initial lead indication and for equity sharing. Accommodating investor interest and needs in this way is expected to expedite capitalization and clinical development,     Key Milestones:  - Selection of lead indication - IND enablement thru Phase I    Summary: CHEC PR has a highly qualified team of advisors that have developed these novel peptide therapeutics with potential is in several multi-billion dollar markets.
