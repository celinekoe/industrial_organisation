Built on user generated content, jobSphere relies on volunteers to post jobs using a bookmarklet and encourages volunteers to check for new jobs once a month from a selected list of sites.  jobSphere's basic principle is that if one user finds and posts a job in ten minutes that one user can save a hundred users 1000 minutes of searching.

The idea for backdoor was born when Daniel, a social networking native, thought that in a world of increasingly open and public communication, there was a growing need for people to have a place to share personal feedbacks, thoughts and feelings with their friends, without the need to disclose their identity.  In a few months after its launch, Backdoor has reached a large user base spread across various continents and demographics, allowing friends to share with each other feedbacks, opinions, feelings and ideas. When receiving a backdoor message, a user will know that it comes from someone he knows and he has selected and he is also able to get a series of clues on who that person might be.  Backdoor was born as an App, but we like to think about it as the platform to enable a new form of transparent human communication.","Information Technology, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Messaging and Telecommunications",1,Daniel Singer,51-100,1,Seed,200000,USD,200000,200000,USD,200000,ArpexCapital,,1,,Private,,,,,,
