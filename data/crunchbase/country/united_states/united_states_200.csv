As a result, approximately 80% of their business over the last decade has been to help applicants finance either the purchase or the refinance of a co-op apartment. They offer rates from a number of different institutions, so every single day they are able to offer their customers the best rates available, not to mention a superior product mix. I love what technology has done for their industry and my business: it speeds their processes, makes all of us more efficient and helps you to receive your application and commitment documents much quicker than you would have in the past. However, my love for technology has some limits. When I call a company I personally detest going through automated phone systems to get an answer to a quick question, and I suppose most people that are looking for a service feel the same way. My solution: I actually have knowledgeable people answer their phones! Why is it important for you to consider using us? Large institutions often dislike dealing with co-ops, they will reduce costs by having automated phones pick up your call, direct your call to an automated queue and then make you wait an unbearable amount of time to speak with someone. If you are patient/ lucky enough to get a ""live body"" on the phone, the chance of that individual knowing the necessary details for a co-op transaction AND competing with their rate is remote! When I started this mortgage company, I wanted to provide better service and, by representing a broad variety of lenders, I believed that I could offer competitive rates and products at the same time. It turns out that I was right! I hope that you will agree that they succeed with regard to these issues. They have a staff that is dedicated to this effort, and as a result their company has been described as a co-op financing boutique. You will find that if you call their office during normal business hours, your call will not be answered by a machine. In fact, more than likely, the person picking up the phone will know a LOT about co-op apartments. They will strive to offer you great service and a great rate for your transaction! They would love to be able to assist you with your transaction, so I encourage you to give us a call!",Financial Services,,,1001-5000,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

New Mexico Water and Electric also reminds our potential customers how the installation of most residential systems will involve a considerable amount of roof work. This factor makes it critical to make sure the installation process is not only professionally executed, but also raises questions about how non-local firms might respond, or not respond when eventual roofing repairs or replacement becomes necessary. NMWE customers secure a reliable connection for followup repairs, maintenance assistance, and other services by our experts.

All of your family and friends with whom you have traded your MiCard will immediately see your new achievements. This app will undoubtedly keep players motivated. As a kid, my friends and I collected and swapped baseball cards. We would compare and brag about our favorite players and our most valuable cards. This was early the 1980’s. There were no personal computers, internet, or mobile phones. It was a simple time and it was AWESOME! Times have changed, and all generations of kids and adults are computer savvy. Laptops, internet, tablets, wi-fi, smart phones, and smart tvs are part of our lives. We are all connected 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. However, baseball has remained America's favorite pastime. Although the game is the same, the way we interact is different. Welcome to MiCard! The idea for MiCard came from our inability to share our baseball and softball stats with family and friends. There are many apps that allow the user to input stats and track them on their own. Additionally, there are apps that allow coaches to track players stats and manage their team. MiCard is different, Players own their stats forever. MiCard offers an easy way to share with family and friends, the fun of trading your MiCard and the opportunity to collect MiCards to “See How You Stack Up.” MiCard allows you to enter your individual stats and updates in real time! All of your family and friends with whom you have traded your MiCard will immediately see your new achievements. This app will undoubtedly keep players motivated. Some key features of MiCard include: PHOTO UPLOAD PITCHING AND POSITION GAME STATS ADD INDIVIDUAL GAME HIGHLIGHTS AND NOTES CHARTS OF YOUR BATTING AND PITCHING TRENDS. STACK UP OF YOU VS YOUR MICARD COLLECTION SHARE YOUR MICARD VIA EMAIL TO FAMILY AND FRIENDS SEARCH FOR OTHER MICARDS TO ADD TO YOUR COLLECTION OR TO TRADE YOUR MICARD WITH ASK FOR PERMISSION TO TRADE MICARDS FOR RESTRICTED ACCOUNTS APPROVE OR DENY MICARD TRADING REQUESTS. IF YOU ARE OLD ENOUGH TO BE AN ADMIN, YOU CAN CREATE SUB-ACCOUNTS SO THAT YOU CAN MANAGE THEIR STATS AND MICARD TRADING TO CONTROL YOUR PRIVACY. After you sign up, please provide feedback.

It takes your data and using our platform turns it into a fast, manageable, and intuitive web interface that allows you to filter, sort, aggregate and group the data in a way for the end-user to understand it better. This end-user could be a colleague creating reports, an interested data-geek, or a consumer.  dataPreneur is a Santa Barbara, California based startup. The platform lets virtually anyone with data turn that data into a market-ready web and mobile app composed of raw data, not just developers or those who have traditionally controlled data warehouses. dataPreneur uses a platform developed over a 10-year period at the enterprise level, and now desires to move to the consumer market with this same technology. It has the potential to query millions of records of data to drill down to the most precise detail, or zoom out to understand broad trends. Searching data is different than searching documents. In a document search you type in a word or a string of words, and the search engine returns all the documents in an order that is determined by the search engine. With our platform, you give directions and it returns data according to your request. Thus the data becomes dynamic; you can search, see the results, then search again until you get the answers you need.","Apps, Internet Services, Mobile, Other, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
