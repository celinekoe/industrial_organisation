The Companyâ€™s growth has been rapid, as it now employs over 300 associates and serves over 180,000 patients.  Additionally, DCC has expanded their line of complementary products that address the complications of diabetes. Simplex Diabetic Supply recently changed its name to Simplex Healthcare.

Currently in beta, expensr has a very clean and simple design with some great features which many users will find appealing.  One nice security feature allows users to upload bank statements manually. Unlike some other financial management applications that require bank usernames / passwords, users can upload .ofx files -- these files only contain the bank account number. Importantly, expensr does not store the .ofx file after parsing it, only the transactions in it. Another interesting part of expensr is the social networking aspect. Since expensr is a social network, users can compare their spending against others. This means users are able to see aggregated data of a particular tag and anonymously compare spending against others. E.g. you can compare rent with other young professionals in San Francisco. Or how much people are spending on groceries in Boston?

There were a lot of lack-luster visual merchandising and guerrilla marketing events which were being held for a number of high profile brands in the area.  After attending numerous expos, conventions and conferences our founder decided he could offer a much better experience for both the brand and the consumer by assembling a talented team and introducing  his personal flair. A team was carefully assembled to offer the resources and talent necessary to make the dream a reality, and so 4EON  was born. With our talent, determination and  innovation, it wasn’t long before we had secured a number of clients and our company was well on it’s way to success. In 2009 we made our way to New York City to create an event for one of our clients.  From that point forward, many other American events fell into place and it wasn’t long before 4EON, Inc had grown into a multinational, experiential marketing firm. Today, our clients span a variety of locations, sizes and industries; including: Automotive, Fashion, Media, Music, Health, Telecommunications, and Food. We attribute all of our success to our motto: “For Everything or Nothing” which is not only our motto, but our approach to each and every campaign.  We believe that you have to push the boundaries to create an experience that will create the impact each of our clients deserve. So each of our events is approached with the idea that nothing is impossible.
