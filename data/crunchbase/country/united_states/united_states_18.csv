To achieve that goal, DataNovo has created the first AI- and machine learning-based system that offers three core features: (1) licensing; (2) AI-driven prior art searches; and (3) patent analytics.  For licensing, with a single key stroke, DataNovo's Software-as-a-Service platform allows any individual or corporate entity to identify potential infringers and associated infringing products to every U.S. patent, and helps patent owners advance monetization efforts and secure licensing opportunities.  For AI-driven prior art searches, with a single patent number (instead of keywords), DataNovo offers users the best prior art against that patent instantaneously. Using artificial intelligence and machine learning, DataNovo aims to reduce search speed, improve result accuracy, and minimize cost. Companies interested in patent landscape can also use DataNovo's patented platform to check if their new product may infringe on any existing patent.   For patent analytics, which are suited for patent owners or business competitors who are looking to gather, analyze, and assess patent validity strength before pursuing or defending patent lawsuits, advancing licensing deals, or structuring M&A transactions, DataNovo's business intelligence helps facilitate real-world settlement, licensing, and purchase negotiations.  With DataNovo, companies are able to obtain stronger, more defensible patents, challenge frivolous lawsuits, assess critical licensing or infringing intelligence, and make informed business and strategic decisions throughout the companies'​ life cycles.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Professional Services, Science and Engineering, Software",2,"Alex Chan, Alexander Loginov",11-50,1,Seed,122000,USD,122000,122000,USD,122000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The idea of spending valuable time searching for them was not appealing, but missing tools also meant he was unnecessarily losing profits. After futile efforts to find an immediate, off-the-shelf solution to this problem, Kafka decided to develop his own system. The first iteration of ToolWatch addressed many of Kafka’s tool-related challenges. However, it wasn’t long before he developed the vision of a total solution for tool, equipment and materials management. Over the next decade, this vision gained rapid acceptance in an industry long plagued by high levels of tool loss, damage and hoarding. Since then, Kafka and the ToolWatch team have implemented thousands of customer-suggested improvements and enhancements, culminating in what is today the world’s leading tool and materials management solution. More than 4,000 organizations in more than 20 countries use ToolWatch to streamline the process of managing tools, equipment, materials and consumable items across their organizations.
