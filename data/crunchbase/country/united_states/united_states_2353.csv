Kloset Karma was born from the realization that fast fashion is a global epidemic. These days, with the increasing use of social media and self exposure, clothes only last one social media posting at a time, which increases the need of cheap and under-quality clothing. In an era where selfies are here to stay and sharing our daily activities is part of our lives, fashion conscious millennials are forced to renew their wardrobe constantly even after wearing an outfit just once, without knowing the real human and environmental cost behind cheap fashion. This fashion exchange marketplace allows users to earn points as well as buying points, to exchange for a whole new wardrobe and keep up with all the social media sharing and never ever repeating an outfit again without breaking the bank!

The founder's company, SAS Games, has developed the successful series of TiViTz math/strategy games and tournaments that have already motivated hundreds of thousands of students to master their math skills. TiViTz was recently named a Microsoft Education Partner of the Year and has won multiple awards from Dr. Toy to Creative Child to National Parenting to Parents' Choice. To reach millions more kids, SAS Games has spun off a new venture called TiViTz eSports to develop an online youth eSports club with games, competitions, activities, avatars, currency and prizes to address the lack of math skills in our youth and to offer a less expensive alternative to math tutoring. Due to the shift of kids' ""heroes"" from traditional sports teams to eSports players, TiViTz eSports has partnered with Team SoloMid (one of the most successful eSports teams in the world) for eSports-related prizes and for membership promotions of the TiViTz Dollar Math Club...where kids (ages 9-15) will compete in eSports-style TiViTz competitions (PvP, Battle Royale, Team Leagues). TiViTz eSports is currently in partnership discussions with several other eSports teams, including those in the NBA 2K, Rocket League and League of Legends. Unfortunately, most parents cannot afford the $40+ per hour for a math tutor. But fortunately, they can afford a $1 per week membership for a youth-driven TiViTz Dollar Math Club. By taking the approach of ""kids helping kids speak math"", TiViTz eSports will help address the looming STEM crisis...3M US STEM jobs unfilled by 2020 and 420M unfilled globally by 2030.  Bottom line: TiViTz eSports will harness the power of eSports to motivate kids to “speak math,” so they can pursue STEM careers, fill our Information Age jobs and shape the future...how many jobs can you think of that don’t involve ANY math?",Education,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

At A Forever Recovery, we understand that no one approach to addiction treatment will work for every individual. We offer a moral reasoning approach to recovery from addiction, so each person can take his or her path to recovery with the spiritual, cognitive, and fellowship support he/she may need. We take an individual approach to heal the mind, body, and spirit of each person with our comprehensive and flexible track options. In addition to offering multiple paths to recovery, we also understand that the process of overcoming addiction is only beginning when drugs and alcohol are removed from the body in the withdrawal process. Previous Trauma and Low Self-Esteem Most addicts have some kind of trauma, or series of events that cause them to think poorly of themselves, and not realize their own power and worthiness for happiness and sobriety. This makes addiction more of a symptom than the problem itself, as underlying trauma is often the catalyst for the dysfunctional behaviors associated with addiction. If we only treat the addiction, and never get to the root of the trauma, we are only masking the problem. At A Forever Recovery, our approach is individualized to change the way people feel about themselves, thereby changing their behavior and empowering them to make the proper decisions to cope and be happy in recovery. Our Approach to Recovery Our drug rehabilitation program is unique in our approach to overcoming addiction in a way that works for everyone. Our clients are given time necessary to accomplish the goals required for a safe and empowered reintegration to society. We understand that every individual is different, and there is no set time period within which any one person’s issues can be addressed. Getting to the root cause of the underlying issues driving addiction is the most important part of treatment, and healing cannot take place until those issues are addressed. Empowerment For Self Healing We empower each person to live life the way it is intended. A life of addiction is riddled with sadness, low self-esteem, and disappointment. This is not the way life should be for anyone, and we want all who walk through our doors to become empowered to make the right decisions for the best interests of themselves, their families, and their communities. The word empower means to give power or authority to. If an addict is given only one general path to recovery, and not provided with the option to heal according to his or her own beliefs and comfort levels, empowerment is taken away from the very start of the road to recovery. Multiple Tracks to Recovery At A Forever Recovery, we understand that every person will have their own path to healing, and we develop a program that guides each individual through a series of courses and individual counseling that fits his or her own belief system and learning preference. The methods we use to accomplish this imperative element for recovery are evidence-based, comprehensive, and personalized. Our faith-based treatment track allows our clients who are either believers in, or have an interest in, the teachings of Jesus Christ. For these individuals, the exploration and strengthening of their Christian faith will fortify the spiritual support they will need to maintain their recovery after treatment. Aftercare Treatment For Continuing Sobriety Since we provide multiple options for the most individualized and effective treatment program for every person, the path to healing at A Forever Recovery starts with empowerment, which is the essential element in all practices required for sustained recovery. The process of tackling daily stressors and triggers, rebuilding broken relationships, finding (or maintaining) a job, and doing all of this while remaining focused on sobriety and health can be daunting and overwhelming. We understand the difficulties associated with an addict returning home to his/her family, spouse, parents, friends, and/or co-workers. AftercareThere are insight, communication, and coping skills that must be at work on multiple levels within the inner circle of a recovering addict returning home in order to facilitate sustained sobriety. This is why our aftercare program is so important and tailored specifically for the needs of each person and his or her inner circle prior to leaving treatment. We at A Forever Recovery, we want the same thing that families and loved ones of addicts want. We want them to be happy, healthy, and making the best decisions for what is right for them and their recovery. develop a plan with each individual before he or she leaves treatment, covering all aspects of life outside the facility walls. We help establish connections to support groups and religious institutions, facilitate the continuation of healthy recovery-minded activities, provide resources for sustained fitness regimens and nutrition, and review contacts for whom a personal accountability partner will be available for any needed support or assistance. Our aftercare program provides constant contact with both recovering addicts, and their families and loved ones to be sure things are on track for a successful recovery. We Can Help You Or A Loved One Overcome Addiction If you or a loved one are suffering from addiction, please call us at 1 (888) 738-4579. We can talk with you today about how we can empower you or your loved one to overcome addiction in a way that is truly holistic, healing the mind, body, and spirit for a lasting recovery and true happiness in life.
