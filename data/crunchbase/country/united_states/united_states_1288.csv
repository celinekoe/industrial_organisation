What it is : Startup Ecology is a better way to teach entrepreneurs to build startups - Their do this by creating an environment that forces us to think better and work more effectively.  Think of it Like the Xavier school for gifted startups - Startup Ecology is a leap forward in startup evolution. Why it matters : Startup ecology is a chance to make history. This approach has never been done before. It is a new way to turn ideas into customers. Their do this by placing the best of coworking, accelerators, hackathons, and tech campuses, into experience. Their have begun with a physical -real world model and are exploring how to bring it into a online model. How it works : Entrepreneurship is an innovative art (unlike business management which is taught as an administrative science, but could use a bit more art.) Learning to become an entrepreneur from a book is like learning to become a designer or a musician from book. It usually won’t happen because the learning the arts requires skill set training in peer driven environment.  Startup Ecology is the first ever co-working environment driven by the principals of skill set training in a peer based environment.  Startup Ecology blends best practices in startup development with advanced thinking in organizational psychology. This allows entrepreneurs with a startup idea to be part of a workspace that trains them, mentors them, and grows them through peer interaction. This is much more than a mere co-working space, and has significant advantages over incubators and accelerators.  Projects that emerge from Startup Ecology Community will be in an excellent position to obtain funding and other growth opportunities. Problems that their overcome: Hindsight bias -  by overvaluing successful case studies, mentor bias  - overcoming the knowledge curse bias, and by shifting thinking dynamics rather than just loading more knowledge and information.","Financial Services, Health Care, Lending and Investments, Real Estate",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

C5i was in the business of “Cyber Security” (Information Security) before the word was even coined. C5i is focused exclusively on providing a comprehensive suite of Information Assurance, Cyber Security Operations, Cyber ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) and Cyber Warfare services. Today, more than ever, government, businesses, and the public are acutely aware of the need for information security and a cohesive, coordinated approach to the protection of vital information and critical infrastructure. In every market sector, however, companies and government agencies make fragmented and redundant investments in monitoring and control of critical systems. This approach is capital-intensive, intelligence-poor, and can hamper a company's ability to respond promptly to system failures and security breaches. C5i's unique blend of security, networking, and management expertise provides clients with the most robust best-of-breed and industry vendor agnostic solutions in the security field. We did not invent the Internet, but we help secure it. We do not develop Industrial Control Systems, but we secure them. We do not develop fighter jets, but we help secure and accredit their applications and systems.  This concentration on our core competencies gives us the edge needed to be agile, to attract likeminded Cyber Security experts who are 100% Cyber Security focused, and to provide the highest level of security for our clients.","Government and Military, Information Technology, Professional Services",,,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Since the screen is used for Triangulation only, and not for identification, the method is far more versatile than existing systems that attempt to ascertain the identity of an object by computing its silhouette either by vision systems or touch sensors. Both position on the screen and orientation are computed by the IdentiToy Technology. The orientation of two toy figures or dolls facing each other on the screen can be used to create an interactive experience between the figures. Further since the unique 128 bit RFID’s create an essentially unlimited number of unique ID’s, a single App or OS can automatically recognize and launch the correct interactive environment for each toy.
