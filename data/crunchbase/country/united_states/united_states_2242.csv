What if that one missed call is your most loyal client and because they couldn’t reach you they changed services? Don’t take that chance! They provide phone coverage 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Their staff is comprised of tenured agents with a passion for customer service and will represent your business with the professionalism it deserves. Staffing issues? Emergency? Language barriers? No problem. Coverage, both English and Spanish, is always available even when life throws you a curve ball such as a sick employee or natural disaster such as a hurricane.  Think you can’t afford it? Think again! An average, entry level, 40 hour a week receptionist makes roughly $23000 a year plus the cost of hiring, training, insurance, and benefits. Depending on your call volume, their answering service runs about $400-$1000 a month with none of the other fees!  SDVA Solutions also provides virtual assistance services including scheduling, billing, data entry, print marketing, online chat monitoring, and many more administrative tasks.
