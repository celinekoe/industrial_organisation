(formerly Ispiri, Inc.) is a software, services and appliance company focused on providing solutions for personal digital content management. In September 2003, Mirra announced the Mirra Personal Server, designed for consumer and small office/home office (SOHO) professionals who need a simple and affordable way to protect, remotely access and share their files, photos, email and other important digital content. The Mirra Personal Server made its debut at the prestigious DEMOmobile Conference, where it won a DEMOgods award. Mirra began shipping to customers online and through select Best Buy Co. stores in December 2003. The Company plans to implement its national retail rollout in Q1 and Q2 of 2004.  As consumers and SOHO professionals acquire digital cameras, adopt broadband and implement wireless networking at a rapid pace, they're discovering that their digital files, email and photos are increasing in value and volume, requiring simpler, more reliable ways to protect their data. And their growing reliance on digital content calls for new ways to share and access it. In the end, our personal digital content is more valuable, and irreplaceable, than our PCs - and we want it protected and accessible from anywhere, at any time. To date, there have been no easy solutions that address the increasingly complex issues faced by consumers and SOHO professionals - or solutions that haven't also required the help of a ""smart cousin"" or professional IT advisor. Mirra Personal Server serves that need, we believe.

Through seminal studies of learning and memory in fruit flies, a key function of the CREB (cAMP Response Element Binding Protein) gene was defined for the first time. The CREB gene encodes a protein which regulates the biochemical pathway that converts short-term memory to long-term memory - and it appears to function similarly in both fruit fly and in man.  Further functional genomic studies have identified a large number of additional genes that participate in this (and parallel) memory pathway(s).
