Food Safety: Organic, GMO-free, free range, grass fed, etc., are common food lingo, but we rarely hear, “where are our gloves that touch the food made and what is in, or on them?” Our gloves are third-party verified clean and tested food safe, so we can answer these questions! Gloves are implicated in 15-18% of all foodborne illness (CDC et al) contributing to over 7,000 sicknesses, 19,200 hospitalizations and 450 deaths every year - costing the economy and business hundreds of millions of dollars in lost production and related impact. 2. Sustainability: The US food sector uses 30 billion PVC vinyl gloves a year. These gloves have been banned or discontinued in most western countries due to carcinogenic chemicals, poor food safety, and serious environmental issues... but not in the US!  Vinyl gloves are thick, wasteful and of inferior strength. They also release dioxin at manufacture and disposal and in many cases contain harmful phthalates, even BPA. We supply a very large US Food retailer with our new tech glove which strengthened their food safety, increased employee satisfaction and reduced their environmental impact by eliminating over 1.2M pounds of glove waste every year. 3. Supply Chain Transparency: The British Medical Association’s In Good Hands report covers labor issues in Southeast Asia’s glove factories. The reports states: ""The manufacture of disposable medical gloves is at high risk for labor rights abuse."" ""...endemic and serious labor rights abuse of workers in factories in Thailand, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka. This includes both factories manufacturing for small-scale medical glove suppliers, and those manufacturing for major international brands.""
