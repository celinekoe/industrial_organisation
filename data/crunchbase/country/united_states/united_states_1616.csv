They strive to produce innovative solutions and offer expert professional services that meet ever evolving needs of their customers. Their flagship product, Argo Trading Platform, is built upon a set of quality software components such as order router/OMS, risk management server and front-end, matching engine, market data dissemination, trading front-end and C++/.NET/Restful API. These components are architected to work in concert to provide a fast and robust, yet flexible, asset-agnostic, multi-user trading environment. Realizing the extreme importance of highest throughput, lowest latency and adaptability of financial data delivery mechanisms, they have designed RMCast — their own reliable multicast messaging system. Use of the most advanced communication techniques along with the industry standard FIX protocol gives their platform a cutting edge advantage over competitors. Their team of talented software engineers has decades of combined first-hand experience in building and implementation of complex software systems. Their success is based on intensive use of object-oriented techniques, design patterns and best of breed communication frameworks. Their research and development is a continuous investment. Argo SE has started as a one person company back in 2004. Being involved in a number of software development projects for various trading firms I was unimpressed by infrastructural software components used in (under hood of) trading applications. I felt that there was a lot of room for improvement, a need for a better solution. A solution that would communicate faster and more efficiently. Process data faster.  I have started from a key component that glues all the architectural elements together – multicast and topic-based messaging system, RMCast. RMCast was designed to satisfy high throughput, low latency, scalability and adaptability demands of modern market data distribution and real-time risk management systems and it became their first commercial product. Later on Simex, a high capacity/low latency matching engine, was added. By that time Argo was no longer a one person company. It was a tightly knit team of three devoted software engineers working long hours and building a system from the very bottom up. Order router, market data feeder, exchange connectivity modules, Risk management facility followed, all of them adding up to a complete, scalable, expandable, trading solution. A better solution.  Today they offer Argo Trading Platform – a complete electronic trading solution. Their clients are prop. trading companies, hedge funds, trading technology providers, broker-dealers and alternative trading systems.  Their development teams are located in US and Ukraine. Their engineers have a lot in common – best education (at least masters degree in computer science from top engineering schools), ability to solve difficult problems, passion for the art of computer programming.","Data and Analytics, Financial Services, Information Technology, Lending and Investments, Professional Services, Software",1,Igor Zvenigorodsky,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
