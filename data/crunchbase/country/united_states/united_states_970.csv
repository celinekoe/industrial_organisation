The business was made possible by the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 which allowed carriers to publish and file their own tariffs with the Interstate Commerce Commission and Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities. With offices next to the 1835 Town Hall at 33 Main Street, TRI began word processing with Tandy Model 12 computers running TRS-DOS and the Scripsit word processing software. It was evident that computers were going to be a major factor in the evolution of TRI. In 1988, TRI relocated to an even older dwelling in the center of town at 9 Waushacum Avenue. The commercially zoned property with a building built in 1840 had been the home of the Davidson family since the 1940’s. The original bark covered birch and oak timbers are still a major part of the structural integrity of the building .

AllegiantMD was born out of the evident need of hospitals to partner with loyal and business minded physicians in order to efficiently meet the operational, quality and clinical care needs of their radiology departments. In the current and continuously evolving radiology market, several non-traditional national radiology companies have emerged. Many of these radiology companies are not owned or operated by radiologists. AllegiantMD, a Physician owned and operated company, recognizes the need for hospitals to partner with business minded individuals who understand both the practice of medicine and the concept of fiscal responsibility. AllegiantMD meets the needs of today’s radiology departments by providing sub-specialty care to the facilities it serves through a combination of various services including on-site and remote coverage.

Hospitals send 1.4 million patients home for 4-6 weeks to administer their own IV antibiotics every year. Twenty percent of patients on outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) are readmitted, each costing $80,000 on average. This is a $22.4 billion problem. Clinicians at the 12,200 home infusion providers in the US have no objective way to identify non-adherence to intervene and prevent readmissions. Rather, they call patients to detect non-adherence, which is time-consuming, inaccurate, and prone to reporting bias. They need a better tool than a phone to monitor adherence.  The solution is HIVE’s patent pending CloudConnect smart catheter. CloudConnect is a reinvented IV line with a simple embedded mechanoelectrical sensor that detects when a medication source is connected. CloudConnect wirelessly sends this information to electronic medical records. HIVE’s value proposition is that clinicians can detect non-adherence in real time and make treatment decisions and prevent costly readmissions based on objective data. HIVE offers CloudConnect as an alternative to the need for clinicians to call every patient with standard IV lines.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",1,Joe Beggs,1-10,4,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,"mHUB, MedTech Innovator, Skandalaris Center for Interdisciplinary Innovation and Entrepreneurship",3,3,,Private,,,,,,
