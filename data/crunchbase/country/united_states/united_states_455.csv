Our flagship product, The Brobe is a luxurious robe with a built-in attached bra designed for women throughout different stages in their life, like cancer treatment recovery and childbirth. The first functional, yet feminine garment for women, designed specifically for women with breast cancer and for nursing mothers. We are first to market, and constantly researching new opportunities to help people heal beautifully. Today, the Recovery Brobe features two pockets on either side to host post-operative fluid drains. The detachable Recovery Bra, also sold separately, features inside pockets for ice packs and/or prosthetic breast. Its Velcro front-closure makes independent dressing easier and more comfortable. The robe’s ¾” sleeves allow for easy IV access during treatment and the fabric is durable, yet luxurious for comfortable wear. It has become the FIRST bra + robe combination designed for breast cancer recovery, made to be worn before, during and after recovery. Since then we’ve expanded our line of recovery accessories with the Shower Belt by Brobe. We are constantly seeking new opportunities to help people feel comfortable while they heal. After the success of the Recovery Brobe, a new group of women – new and expectant mothers – raised their voices, asking for a functional, yet feminine nursing garment for wear in the hospital and at home. In 2013, the Mommy Brobe launched, featuring the same high-quality design in a bra + robe combination specifically for breastfeeding.  We focus on the patient's wellness, not their sickness. Our hope is that we can empower each person to regain their independence, dignity and sense of control to overcome some of life's most challenging physical curveballs.","Clothing and Apparel, Commerce and Shopping, Community and Lifestyle, Consumer Goods, Design, Health Care",1,Allison Schickel,1-10,3,,,USD,,,USD,,"HATCHER+, Quake Capital Partners, SWAN Impact Network",,3,,Private,,,,,,

Manual bus routing takes months to create and lacks key resources for true optimization, meaning time and money are wasted. The result? District teachers were being laid off and school programs were being eliminated. The founders of BusBoss knew there had to be a better way. Their philosophy was if they could save one teacher’s position, keep music, sports or other programs running, it was worth developing a bus routing software system that helped school districts save time and money. BusBoss bus routing software has evolved greatly over the past years, but their values remain the same: Their team philosophy is based on collaboration and a can-do attitude; they always champion innovation and integrity. Above all, their customers’ needs come first. With their spirited approach to creating a comprehensive and sophisticated school bus routing software package, transportation directors and contractors are now able to create optimized and efficient school bus routes for their districts.
