Since NGL Media is a B2B company with their own multi-screen distribution platform, they have the freedom to leverage the sum of the parts across all things video without imposing their brand or limiting theirselves to any one outlet.  In short, their holistic approach to video ensures maximum TOTAL market reach with the advertiser always coming first. The core NGL Media team is comprised of three entrepreneurs and one very famous actor/comedian (hint:  his last name rhymes with Leguizamo), who are dedicated to re-imagining the ways in which Latinos can be reached and engaged with video.

Additionally, as VCs look for certain key attributes in investment opportunities, we assist the companies to highlight and communicate these points effectively. Investor Contacts Most VC firms specialize by stage, sector or geographical preference and usually work with a trusted ecosystem of executives, advisors and other venture capital firms when making new investments. Over the last decade, we have worked with over 100+ venture capital firms (including most top-tier VCs) closely in various roles ranging from sharing portfolio companies as investment opportunities, board advisors and co-investors.

While conventional calendars provide time management features, they do little to realize the value of time. Our vision is to organize time & make it meaningful. By fusing calendar events with real-world semantic knowledge, we can develop a web-scale graph that collates all the facts about people, places, and events. We call this the Time Graph. This computational breakthrough of organizing the web as things, not strings, was first achieved with the introduction of the Google Knowledge Graph. By applying similar ML techniques, we can explore the world as made up of things, and we can experience the world as made up of events — of happenings. In our everyday happenings, we carry on tasks — forging relationships, indulging curiosities, pursuing purpose and happiness — all within a ticking clock. It's why, as time charges forward, it can feel like we have limited control over the use of our time. We give too much time to tasks that should take less time, and not enough on activities that give our hearts joy. Why does a Monday DMV visit feel it drags on forever, and a Sunday brunch spent with closest friends too short? Because the conventional calendar treats the physical flow of time as constant, its value unchanging and independent of any external context. It is why we are developing Timeless calendar to enrich each event with its own meaning and value relative to the vantage of the observer. Or philosophically, time is indexical, as the value of time can be measured only in relation to the context in which it occurs. Our philosophical rumination on the meaning of time is a reflection of our own challenges of organizing time. Intuitively we feel our experience of time and events is complex and filled with personal idiosyncrasies. In our lifetime, we make millions of time-event decisions from small to big: when to wake up, when to eat, when to meet with friends and families, when to exercise, how much to sleep, when to take a vacation. While we can work harder to earn more money, it is impossible to earn more time. So we use time-saving services or get help when we lack the necessary qualifications to perform specific tasks. The Internet provides improvements in the retailing of goods through increased speed, convenience, and large inventory. Amazon made it possible to instantly fulfill millions of orders with a click of a button. We believe we can achieve the same economic value for millions of service providers and billions of service customers. The calendar is the de-facto time management tools to match people’s time & services. Our business plan is to build a calendar as a service marketplace to help us save time — by getting helpful services with a tap of a button.",,1,Zi Wang,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
