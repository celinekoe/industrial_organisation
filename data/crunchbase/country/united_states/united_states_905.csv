For any property, you can see a list of comparable homes and how much they sold for. There are also useful heat maps that show housing trends for a given city or region at a glance. One may wonder what Cyberhomes has to bring to the table in the slew of real-estate websites. Fidelity National Financial has a direct view on every home transaction in the country. Other than the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) that brokers use, any company that wants information on properties sold, home ownership, or mortgage issuance needs to license it from one of two sources: either Fidelity National Financial or First American (Zillow accesses its data from First American). Since CyberHomes has a direct line into the Fidelity National Financial database, it is possible that we will see information updated much faster.
