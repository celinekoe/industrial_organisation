US retail candle sales are estimated at $3.14 billion annually, and over 1 billion pounds of wax are used in producing candles each year. However, the industry has very little regulation - the majority of the wax material used contributes to deforestation, destruction of native pollinator populations, and relocation of indigenous peoples. Inexpensive candles are often made with toxic materials, such as wicks containing heavy metals and petroleum based waxes such as paraffin.  Our vision is to open up a conversation about the industry, and sell a product that is transparent about sourcing both wholesale and direct to the consumer.
