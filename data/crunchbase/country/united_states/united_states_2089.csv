At the NeuroDevelopment Center, you can build a strong, supportive, and collaborative relationship with an experienced psychologist. With our wide range of tools for testing and assessment, we will help you understand your difficulties.  Then we will work with you to implement the solutions that are right for you. We won’t just listen, nod our heads, and sympathize. We will help you with the hard work of change and growth. We hope you will learn more in these pages about our psychological services, and then decide to join us. You have many choices: traditional and innovative approaches. Many people are helped by traditional forms of treatment like medication and counseling or psychotherapy. But way too many people continue to struggle and suffer with psychological disorders despite multiple attempts to get help. Many go from doctor to doctor. Take pill after pill. Some finally just give up, too discouraged to make another phone call, tell their tale again. Fortunately, brain science has pointed the way to a promising new approach to therapy. Research has shown that our brains are capable of enormous change. It’s called neuroplasticity. This finding is giving rise to new solutions that harness this capacity for change to treat many psychological disorders or conditions.  At the NeuroDevelopment Center, we closely follow the research on these promising approaches. We recognize the need for scientific evidence, and carefully evaluate the research on new therapy methods. But we also realize that it takes decades to compile conclusive scientific proof. You may not want to wait until the research is conclusive. So we offer neurofeedback and Cogmed working memory training and even our Preschool ADHD LEAP program – research supported treatments that harness the brain’s capacity for change through brain exercise and training. We offer the tried and true as well. Our professionals have decades of experience with proven traditional psychological services like individual psychotherapy, family, and group therapy. At the Neurodevelopment Center, you have lots of choices. Join us. We can sit down together, understand your situation, and decide what approach is the right one for you. For many conditions, we have solutions: ADHD + ADD Anxiety Attachment disorder Autism spectrum disorder Brain injury/Concussion Bipolar disorder Cognitive decline Depression Learning disabilites Migraines PTSD","Education, Health Care",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

By doing so, Equal Foot minimizes contract risks for all parties involved, reducing delays in performance, misunderstandings of performance, risks of non payment, and the costs of conflict resolution.   Pretty much any contract involving remuneration can be entered into using the service, from sale of goods (products, imports/exports, etc.) to provision of services (home improvement, construction, software development, etc.).  Parties can add boilerplate terms, conditions, specifications and warranties and any particulars. When both parties agree to the terms of contract, it becomes a binding contract.  		 Parties can then manage the contract, deliverables, performance and payments using Equal Foot's tools, with each milestone payment made by the buyer into a secure escrow account so that the seller knows it will get paid if it performs. After seller performs the milestone, the buyer will release the payment from escrow. If the parties have a dispute, it is resolved efficiently and economically through Equal Foot's dispute resolution process, administered by the American Arbitration Association.","Other, Professional Services",2,"John D.
