Our solution redefines the healthcare experience of patients, payors, and providers by connecting all participants in the healthcare decision to create bundled pricing in real time, simplify scheduling, secure payor approval, and guarantee immediate cash payment™. Savvos eliminates the need for health plans to develop networks or direct contracts for elective outpatient care by making immediate cash payment the future of mainstream healthcare.  Savvos members know the cost when scheduling care, and providers are paid immediately; this unique combination reduces medical costs up to 90% compared to traditional networks or legacy billing practices.  The implementation of immediate cash payment solutions within health plans has resulted in a drastic cost reduction compared to billed charges, contracted rates, direct contracts, and allowable amounts for elective outpatient care.   The examples below are pulled from actual procedure requests within the Savvos system: Example 1:  Inguinal Hernia Repair	CPT Code 49505	Zip Code 46123 Proposed Cost Without Savvos: Billed Charge for Facility Only: $19,739 Allowed Charge for Facility: $13,560 Allowed Charge for Surgeon: $2,200 (estimated cost) Allowed Charge for Anesthesia:  $800 (estimated cost) Total Allowed Charge without Savvos: $16,560 Savvos Solution: Immediate Cash Pay Bundled Price: $8,330 Result: 49.7% reduction in costs through Savvos Example 2:  Tympanostomy 		CPT Code 69436	Zip Code 23502	 Proposed Cost Without Savvos: Allowed Charge for Bundled Price: $11,810 Savvos Solution: Immediate Cash Pay Bundled Price: $2,200 Result: 81.4% reduction in costs through Savvos Example 3:  Cervical Disc Rep	CPT Code 22856	Zip Code 80233 Proposed Cost Without Savvos: Billed Charge for Facility & Anesthesia: $85,000 Allowed Charge for Facility & Anesthesia: $34,450 Allowed Charge for Surgeon: $4,068 Total Allowed Charge without Savvos: $38,518 Savvos Solution: Immediate Cash Pay Bundled Price: $12,500 Result: 67.55% reduction in costs through Savvos Example 4:  Total Lap Hysterectomy	CPT Code 58570	Zip Code 92861 Proposed Cost Without Savvos: Allowed Charge for Facility: $27,325 Allowed Charge for Surgeon: $4,200 Allowed Charge for Anesthesia:  $1,108 Total Allowed Charge without Savvos: $32,633 Savvos Solution: Immediate Cash Pay Bundled Price: $7,895 Result: 76% reduction in costs through Savvos The movement towards price transparency requires more than a casual listing of chargemaster prices or regional averages.  Savvos connects patients with actual prices from facilities located in the patient’s local market, resulting in dramatic cost savings to the health plan.  Most patients are provided with generous financial incentives to engage with affordable providers through Savvos, including waiving the deductible or waiving all out-of-pocket costs.  The results of implementing Savvos are powerful: 1.	Enhanced member experience through Savvos messaging center that connects all parties involved in the decision-making process for a specific procedure 2.	Dramatic cost reductions for health plans 3.	Improved member benefits through generous incentives such as deductible waivers 4.

Clinical laboratories play a vital role in healthcare by providing crucial information through laboratory tests, which often guide medical decisions for both individuals seeking treatment and those focused on preventive care. The team behind Tribal Diagnostics has personally experienced the pain of losing loved ones to various health conditions, such as substance abuse, cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and COVID-19. This drives them to address the issue of healthcare accessibility, particularly in underserved areas, where many individuals are unable to seek proper care due to the high cost. In 2016, Tribal Diagnostics was established with the intention of being part of the solution. Their goal is to simplify healthcare by offering high-quality laboratory tests at transparent and affordable prices, ensuring that more people can access the care they need.","Data and Analytics, Health Care",1,Cory Littlepage,101-250,1,,3200000,USD,3200000,3200000,USD,3200000,Raven Indigenous Capital Partners,1,1,,Private,,,,,,

Their customers include financial institutions, retailers, government agencies (including central banks), mints, jewelers and other commercial operations around the world. Their global network serves customers in more than 100 countries. They have ownership interest in companies in 41 countries and agency relationships with companies in additional countries. They employ approximately 59,900 people and their operations include approximately 1,100 facilities and 12,000 vehicles. Brink's was founded in 1859 and their headquarters are located in Richmond, Virginia. Brink's was founded in Chicago on May 5, 1859 when Perry Brink purchased a horse-drawn wagon and made his first delivery. The wagon bore his new company's name – Brink's City Express. Chicago was booming, fueled by new railroads built to exploit the growing economy of the surrounding Midwestern U.S. With railroads came manufacturers, distributors, banks and insurance companies, all of whom attracted business travelers to the new city. In the early days, Brink used his single wagon to transport travelers' luggage between Chicago rail stations and hotels. In 1860, Brink's employees delivered luggage and parcels during the Republican National Convention, where an estimated 50,000 delegates and spectators assembled to see local dark-horse candidate Abraham Lincoln win the nomination over other contenders. In 1871, the Great Chicago fire destroyed some 18,000 buildings, including the headquarters of Brink's City Express. Miraculously, Brink's horses and wagons were saved and the company was back in operation within a week. As Chicago recovered, Brink's grew. By 1872, Brink's ran 20 wagons to every part of the city three times a day and had begun service to the prosperous new suburbs. The company advertised fees less than those of competitors: 25 cents to deliver a trunk from a train station to anywhere in the city.","Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Professional Services",1,Brink's Co,10001+,,IPO,,,,,,,,,,9,Public,1996-01-12,,,BCO,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/brink-s-ipo--c194e19c,NYSE - New York Stock Exchange
