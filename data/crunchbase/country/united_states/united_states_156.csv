More about my company :- MealBnB stands for Meal Bigger & Better for selling homemade parties online. MealBnB business model of sharing economy is as successful as Airbnb & Uber, And the expected market share for MealBnB will be bigger than Airbnb & Uber because each house worldwide has a kitchen. I started MealBnB because I want to contribute at solving the unemployment problem by helping people work from home The problem that I am solving  MealBnB is a Win-Win situation because it will create jobs by helping people to work from homes and save money for its customers instead of going to expensive restaurants.  So MealBnB will be the middleman between party organizer at home and online customers. My solution, and the unique about my approach to the problem :- MealBnB will help people  - Who can't cook like students, single people. - Who don't have time for cooking like employed and big families. - Who tired of cooking like old people. MealBnB doesn't require renting stores nor hiring employees to run the business since the whole business will be conducted from homes.  This will eliminate the need for rental premises and reduce operational costs thereby maximize shareholders’ capital.  This is a great opportunity to invest in a fast growing business with minimal competition rates that will provide amazing returns for your investment on the global scale.
