SURF provides users with freedom of work, letting them interact with applications, data, and each other securely. It addresses the critical business asset neglected by security experts for years: The browser. The browser is the access frontier for everything: users, data, corporate assets, applications, development activities - and cyber criminals, too. SURF Security has transformed the browser into your strongest security asset while providing complete end-user privacy – all with full compliance.
