Platform Beds experienced steady growth. With the success of the initial launch, in the following years more brands would be added that had seen success with consumers at a store level and soon the online retailer would be offering dozens of different brands online.

Their aim is to optimize the advertisement units of your website. They attempt to capitalize on a primary shortcoming of contextual advertisements: After their initial placement into text by publishers, formatting, placement, and layout is seldom altered and tested to see if response can be improved. YieldBuild is able to automatically optimize your siteâ€™s ad spots with the most profitable combination of ad layout, style, and network. The system continually tests alternative configurations of layouts, networks, and color as it looks for the highest performing ones. It takes about 10,000 impressions to train the system. As users become unresponsive to the ads, the system switches to a more profitable combination of layout and networks. Setup is easy and similar to Google AdSense. In addition to supporting some of the most popular ad network options, YieldBuild offers its publishers two ad source options - the Premium Display and Premium Text Ad Programs - with which to maximize page revenue. Drawing from choice network and agency network sources, like Microsoft pubCenter, Advertising.com and Traffic Marketplace, the Premium Ad Programs grant medium-sized publishers access to ads typically restricted to much larger publishers only.","Advertising, Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment, Sales and Marketing, Software",2,"Paul Deeds, Paul Edmondson",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
