Managers input employee information, including positions they can work, skill levels, approved time off, and pay rates into a Set Up Wizard, which takes about 1-2 minutes per employee if management fills every field. This is done only once. Managers then use a User Wizard to create templates for schedules. For example, a manager might create a ""Saturday"" template, a weekly template, or a ""Tax-free weekend"" template. When scheduling, the manager selects the templates to fill, and TimeForge AutoScheduler automatically schedules employees in the optimal budget-friendly schedule, honoring employee requests. After set up, it takes less than five minutes to create an employee schedule. Employees each have a password-protected account on TimeForge through which they can view upcoming schedules. Additionally, TimeForge sends automatic notifications to employees when schedule information is posted or changed. These notifications can be sent through email, text message, Facebook, or all three.  TimeForge also offers attendance tracking, through which each employee clocks in or out using their TimeForge account password. TimeForge also offers biometric fingerprint scanners, which absolutely eliminate the possibility of buddy-punching.

And that information overload led to a greater dependence on search engines, question and answer sites, and discussion forums. Today, the focus is turning to individuals, and empowering each of us to connect with the right people and the right information, at just the right time - leveraging location services where appropriate. Splore helps people pursue the things that are most important in life - their passions, causes, hobbies...by helping to leverage the increasing wealth of data and knowledge available around the world. Our initial focus is on peer to peer healthcare. Chronic illness affects nearly half the population of the United States.  While physicians provide critical diagnosis and treatment options for their patients, these individuals and their loved ones must deal with traumatic lifestyle changes every day, often for the rest of their lives.  Not only do these conditions result in 7 out of every 10 deaths in the world, and many billions of dollars in medical costs, but they also leave hundreds of millions of isolated and unhappy people in their wake. Splore was founded by physicians and technology professionals.  Its immediate goal is the development of social/mobile software solutions to empower patients to create meaningful peer-to-peer connections with other patients, healthcare providers, and an entire wellness ecosystem looking to improve the lives of those suffering from chronic disease.","Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment",2,"Larry Padgett, Shawn Ivey",1-10,1,Seed,700000,USD,700000,700000,USD,700000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

In response to this evolution, Gramercy has thoughtfully and deliberately expanded our investment capabilities. We offer a wide range of investment solutions across emerging markets. Gramercy’s experience predates our founding by over ten years. Many of our investment professionals have been active investors in emerging markets for their entire careers, which has provided them with a thorough understanding of the complexities of the asset class. Due to the multi-asset collaborative effort of our Investment Committee, the firm is afforded a unique perspective of the market. Our extensive emerging markets experience, particularly within the distressed arena, has allowed us to develop deep local relationships in emerging markets countries.
