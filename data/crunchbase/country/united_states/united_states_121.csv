The service, which has garnered numerous accolades throughout its industry, has been featured by a number of different media outlets including The View, the New York Post, and USA Today. That last publication made special note to single out that the service “has kept teens out of dangerous situations.” When commenting on the service, popular media personality Rosie O’Donnell stated that she uses it personally. “I use TeenSafe. As a parent of five, this is what I’m doing and it’s working,” said O’Donnell. One key tool the service provides to parents is the ability to monitor their child’s text messages. This feature can monitor both incoming or outgoing text messages and even allows parents to view messages that have been deleted off their teen’s phone. In addition to text messages, the service provides parents with the ability to keep track of other forms of communication that their child engages in, such as phone calls and third-party messaging apps. The monitoring service also extends functionality to tracking phone location, both past and present, as well as keeping a log of websites a child visits. With a particular focus on combatting cyberbullying and online predators, the service is used extensively to help monitor social media services as well. With those types of apps and sites being a primary place for bullying to take place, many parents find that monitoring their child’s habits connected to social media provides them with a chance to protect their child from the nefarious behavior. This type of safeguarding ultimately helps parents contribute to their child’s overall well-being. Privacy is a top priority for the company that runs the TeenSafe service. In the pursuit of full data security, all collected data is protected with SSL and encryption that is compliant with NIST Encryption Standards. As a result, all transmissions remain secure and encrypted until they are received by the parent utilizing the service. To further safeguard privacy, the company does not view any encrypted data generated by monitoring. This means data is only viewable by the child and the parent.","Apps, Community and Lifestyle, Mobile, Software",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
