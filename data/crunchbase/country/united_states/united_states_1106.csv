Conversations are at the foundation of every relationship and relationships are what drive engagement and loyalty to people and brands. Virsona is redefining how people can connect with one another to strengthen relationships between friends, family, characters or brands. Virsona enables users to create virtual personas, or Virsonas, of real-life, fictional or historical figures, living or dead, who through an online chat format independently and intuitively remember, react and respond just like the person or brand they were designed to emulate. The Virsonas are powered by the company's innovative, patent-pending artificial intelligence technology, which gives the service its human-like chat capabilities. Users create Virsonas by building online life archives of facts, letters, journals, memories and photos and then invite family and friends to access and interact with their Virsona and its content. The more information that is added to a Virsona the more accurate and interactive that Virsona will be. There are two different types of Virsonas. The first is your own Personal Virsona and the second is Community Virsonas. You can interact with Community Virsonas simply by clicking on the picture and chatting. To add information to an existing Community Virsona or participate in building a new one, you must create an account and log in.    A Personal Virsona allows users to establish a digital immortality by creating and building an interactive legacy and archive for people to communicate with and access for generations to come.  With a Personal Virsona based on your own life experiences, you can ""live"" forever online.  The first step in creating your own Personal Virsona is by establishing a free account and login at www.virsona.com. Once you create your free account, you can start populating your Virsona with your life memories. The more memories and thoughts you add to your Virsona the more your Virsona will remember, reason and react just like you.   Consumers populate their Virsonas thru a chat box. The conversation looks much like an Instant Messaging, or Text Messaging chat. Simply click on the chat box and type away. Consumers can also populate their Virsona with emails, video, photos, etc.  Through regular use of the Virsona, users can ""train"" their online self to act, ""speak"" and behave like they would in real life. Personal Virsonas can also be shared with friends and family and can be made private or public.   Virsona is the key to consumers' ""immortality.""
