There are over 4.5 million households that could benefit from the adoption of clean cookstoves and the market value for clean cookstoves in Kenya is approximately $150,000,000. Wisdom Stoves manufactures and distributes energy efficient stoves for rural and peri-urban families in Kenya. The wisdom stove differs from other stoves in the market because it does not require power to operate and is able to burn any biomass material, rather than just the pellets needed for other stoves. By turning biomass waste into charcoal the stove helps customers save 50% of the money usually spent on fuel, making it affordable as well as beneficial to customers? health.
