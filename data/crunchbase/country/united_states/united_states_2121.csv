Richard Cross designed the Zig Jig to catch trout in streams and rivers. The Zig Jig is a hand tied marabou jig with a powder coated head and a very sharp, extra strong hook. It is manufactured by fisherman, for fisherman. Richard Cross designed the Zig Jig to withstand the abuse from rocks and gravel and to keep you hooked up when that big fish hits. We offer a wide array of Zig Jigs, Micro Jigs, fishing Rods and various other tools required for fishing. We offer an extensive selection of Zig Jigs in beautiful colors and different sizes like 1/32, 1/16, 1/8, 3/16 and 1/4 ounces. Our micro Jigs come with a good strong hook that wouldn't straighten out when you hook a bigger fish. We offer these in 3 different sizes - 1/64, 1/80 and 1/124th oz. Micro Jigs have the same quality powder coated heads as our regular jigs, and are also hand tied. We offer best quality, durable Zig Jigs at competitive prices to fishermen across the nation. The heads of jigs are powder coated and not just dipped in paint. The powder coating gives better durability and last longer under real fishing conditions. The most important part of any jig is the hook, and we use only the best. We use the Mustad Ultra Point black nickel hooks which are sharper when they're new, and stay sharper longer. The action of the Zig Jig is unequaled in its ability to attract and catch fish. The offset shape of the Zig Jig head creates a zig zag, back and forth action as it falls. This unique action keeps the Zig Jig in the strike zone longer and gives the illusion of wounded prey, which drives fish crazy. We offer the Best Marabou jigs in the market.
