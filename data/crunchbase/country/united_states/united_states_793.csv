Unfortunately there was nothing currently on the market that addressed all of the dangers she faced as a mom and wife who loved to cook. Meanwhile, Sam has always been a pro at “Do It Yourself” projects, and, with his own materials, made the very first prototype of The Knife Glider! The idea soon sprung up that this is something that every cook, whether amateur or professional would love to have in her kitchen arsenal. Brilliant Inventors, LLC was formed shortly after in 2010, as a medium to bring this idea to life. Under this company, Sam and Jen started their own Indiegogo campaign back in 2011, allowing them the funds needed to get started on this journey from idea to production. They also entered business plan competitions with the City of Mission and the City of McAllen, to provide them the means to move forward and materialize their vision. After hours, days, weeks, and even years of developing, testing, and tweaking what Sam and Jen originally came up with, the Knife Glider is now available to Kitchen Warriors everywhere!","Commerce and Shopping, Consumer Goods, Food and Beverage",2,"Jennifer Shipp, Samuel Shipp",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Areas of focus are Sports, Fashion, and Local / Small Business Adrenaline Commerce uses a tried and true ecommerce platform that allows us to focus on designing aesthetically perfect ecommerce websites that look awesome and keep customers shopping and navigating our clients sites. In the area of design and web site development, we differ from most all in-state competitors in that we do not have to spend ten's of thousands of dollars building the ""Back-end"" of an ecommerce website, and then spend the remainder of the client budget putting together a design template for the ""Front-end"" (user facing web pages), while hoping that there is budget left over to optimize some of the site for the web. We also do not have to worry about going through the time consuming and very costly process of getting each web site CISP Certified and PCI Compliant as our platform vendor has already done that for us.  Since Adrenaline Commerce uses a proven ecommerce platform to build from, we are able to focus every dollar spent on a killer design, and most importantly, in optimizing each and every web page for the search engines and for the clients that will be viewing them. We have a specific and intended outcome or action that is designed into each page on a clients site. These actions could be anything from adding a product to a shopping cart, requesting a quote, or configuring a custom product.  Each Adrenaline Commerce website is a turn key solution that includes website design, development, optimization, and training. Each site deployment includes a number of analytics and measurement tools that provide our clients with near real-time performance tools to help in decision making as the site grows and expands its sales.","Commerce and Shopping, Design, Professional Services",1,Joe Minock,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

These innovations are driven by a user-centered focus on empowering people – applying powerful interactive tools and media for communication, collaboration, culture, and commerce.  Teleshuttle has multiple patent portfolios in development, and over 200 companies have licensed one or more of these patents, including licenses for use by nearly every major provider of smartphones and many major companies in TV/video.  Much of Teleshuttle's current work is pro-bono, with focus on FairPay. Areas of activity include: --FairPay - An entirely new concept of what a price is and why -- an architecture for efficiently pricing digital content/services in the context of an ongoing relationship. FairPay is based on customer dialogs about value, and develops a buyer reputation based on Internet feedback, to go beyond ""freemium,"" to a far more efficient and dynamically adaptive hybrid of free and paid offerings.  FairPay was presented 12/1/11 at an MIT Enterprise Forum of NYC symposium on ""Better Strategies for Monetizing Digital Offerings,"" and on the HBR Blog on 11/18/13. Teleshuttle is working on a pro-bono basis with industry and academic partners on research, trials, and applications of FairPay, and offers free consultation services.   --CoTV - Coactive TV – provides a rich platform for the growing trend toward multi-screen viewing and simultaneous, or “coactive,” use of TV and the Web.  CoTV creates a powerful new compound medium that fully maintains the best of both (and works with ordinary TVs and PCs/tablets/phones as companion devices) – while riding the trend toward user-centered media multitasking in the wireless, networked home.  Fifteen Reisman CoTV-related patents have issued, with more allowed or pending.  These patents were licensed to RPX Corporation member companies as of 3/10/15.   --Search and the Social Web and Semantic Web (Sold) - A portfolio including seven patents issued in 2005-2014, with others pending.  Sold 7/6/09 to RPX Corporation, the first defensive patent aggregator.     --Internet push distribution and software update (Sold) - In the early 1990s, Teleshuttle developed a patent portfolio that was later licensed to BTG International for commercialization.  This portfolio includes nineteen patents awarded in 1997-2014.  BTG's licensing efforts led to patent infringement suits against Microsoft and Apple. On 3/31/06, BTG announced the sale of these patent rights for $35 million, plus a share of future profits, and that BTG and Teleshuttle would no longer pursue those suits.  These patents and continuing license efforts are controlled by Intellectual Ventures.   Other patent portfolios in development relate to such areas as  --Big Data and The Internet of Things -- data exchange for smart, connected products, including usage data and ratings,  --Digital media storage and asset management, and  --The Idea Adoption Agency (including advanced methods for collaboration and reputation management). Consulting clients have included News Corporation/TVGuide, Dow Jones/Telerate, Euro RSCG/MVBMS, HealthScout/RxRemedy, AppliedTheory Communications, and BTG International, as well as Intellectual Ventures, RPX Corporation, and other prominent companies in the Intellectual Property space. (Teleshuttle is not seeking paid consulting work, but does selectively offer consulting on FairPay without fee.) Teleshuttle was founded by Richard Reisman in 1994 as an innovative online software/service provider. Reisman is an innovator and thought leader, advancing powerful interactive tools/media for human communication, collaboration, culture, and commerce since long before the Web. His media experience includes developing and marketing CoTV at Teleshuttle, a senior management role at HealthScout.com, leading the design and development of News Corp's original TVGuide Online service through market testing in the early '90s, managing development for Baseline (since acquired by The New York Times), and very early involvements in hypermedia, interactive graphics, and online communities.  Reisman has about 50 patents and many more allowed or pending.

As opposed to teaching courses solely for the material of the course itself (such as video game development or robotics), the co-founders saw a fantastic opportunity to engage and excite students about academic subjects by the using the material from the courses they were teaching. The courses were fully rewritten to both be very fun and exciting, and to also be filled with academic connections between the course material and things kids were learning in school. This was the foundation for the business – getting kids excited about academic subjects through fun and often non-traditional courses. GBA courses and programs are designed to get young students excited about math, science, and technology, and more, through teaching video game development, robotics, fashion design, and other courses. Students apply and practice what they're learning in school through the work they do in building their video games and other projects.  In GBA courses, students use and strengthen math skills, logic skills, communication skills, concentration and critical thinking skills, problem solving and creative thinking -- all while doing something they love and enjoy. Their tools include Video Game Design and Development, Robotics, and 3D Computer Modeling and Animation. GBA classes and summer camps are designed for children in grades 5-12. Additionally, they offer their Starburst Program, which is designed for children in Kindergarten through 4th grade (K-4). They currently offer school-year programs and summer camps at Hofstra University, Stony Brook University, Queensborough Community College, The Newton Institute in Queens, NY, and the Westbury School District, as well as other locations.  GBA was formed in 2006, and has expanded each year since. Along with their Video Game Design and Robotics classes, they've introduced their Fashion Design for Kids course, and an expanded 3D Modeling and Animation course. They're very happy to be continuing their classes at Hofstra University Saturday Classes for Young People, and at the Cradle of Aviation Museum, along with their other locations, including Queensborough Community College, C.W. Post University, and the Newton Institute in Queens, NY. GBA has had articles published about its courses in Newsday, The Westbury Times, the Manhasset Press and other publications.

TFT is industry changing and will solve many of problems that are limiting seafood industry growth and profitability, including rising costs of energy, feeds, waste and wastewater treatment, competition for clean water supplies, and mounting evidence that contaminants brought into the systems with marine-based feeds represent serious health problems. TFT will generate billions of dollars of new revenues in an environmentally responsible way.  It is: •	Local, minimizing transportation costs and carbon emissions, while enhancing product freshness •	Contaminant free  •	Uses no fishmeal or fish oils thus preserving declining oceanic fish populations  • 	Uses local bio-mass significantly incentivizing reforestation and deforestation avoidance •	Environmentally restorative, no wastewater pollutants, no odors, all solids beneficially reused Our approach to the global seafood market is to license technology to leading industry partners.  Commercial development will leverage the expertise of established operators within the existing supply chain.  The existing market is complex and fragmented, and we anticipate developing multiple specific partners based on geography and market segment. We seek to raise approximately $400,000.  Based on income projections which will generate a return on investment over the first five years of commercial operation that exceeds twenty to one.    This is based on an objective of 24 operating facilities in the US by 2021, which we believe is achievable.  We estimate 2021 revenues of about $215 million/year to our licensees.  This level of production represents a modest penetration of approximately 1.5% of the US market and less than 0.1% of the global market.
