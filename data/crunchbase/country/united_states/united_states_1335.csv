First, we provide a cheaper source of credit, which is justified by a different level of underwriting.  While traditional hard money lenders base credit decisions on the asset alone, we focus on the track record of the developer as well.  Only experienced operators receive funds, not just any novice investor who happens across an attractive deal.  Good borrowers, even when they encounter challenges with completing and/or liquidating their project, have planned alternatives and additional resources that can assist them in fulfilling their financial obligations.  This difference alone can make the difference between profitable and unprofitable long-term investment.   Next, we have a holistic approach toward lending that comes from wearing many different hats.  We have been on all sides of the transaction, from title to real estate brokerage to rehab investor to negotiator/facilitator/wholesaler.  This diverse perspective allows us to understand the various roles, needs and challenges of each of the players involved, to better structure deals and to anticipate and address competing concerns of the parties involved.  While many lenders aggressively seek to nickel and dime borrowers and even maliciously foreclose in order to obtain the underlying asset (their covert goal even when making the loan), we believe in cultivating long-term relationships based on trust and partnership. If we wish to maintain long-standing relationships and continue in business, one-time transactions that unwind with alienated parties is not the way to do it.  Furthermore, the reality is that these deals and real estate in general rarely go as planned, and parties must make allowance for imperfection.  We recognize this fact, and have the infrastructure and connections in place to nimbly propose alternatives to adjust accordingly.","Other, Real Estate",,,1-10,1,,100000,USD,100000,100000,USD,100000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Who are we? Our team includes bright, dedicated individuals from Google, NASA, Harvard, Stanford, MIT and even a Forbes 30 Under 30. We are a small, but very strong and tight-knit team and beyond just being a team, we are all good friends. How do we do it?  By orchestrating a series of chemical reactions, we are able to strip aluminum of a thin, naturally-occurring barrier. Once this barrier is stripped, the aluminum will freely react with water to liberate hydrogen from the water molecules. Why is nobody else doing this? Simple - until Trolysis came along, it has been a ""net-negative"" process. The sheer fact that it took electricity to split water (electrolysis) or remove the barrier from aluminum (pulverization) meant that the output of the system (hydrogen) would be less energy than what was put in.  What we do differently is eliminate the need for electricity input by utilizing chemical reactions. this means you're converting chemical energy (which is abundant) to hydrogen and electricity (which are valuable and scarce).

The Donna Karan Company,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/the-donna-karan-company,"Fashion, Lifestyle, Shopping","New York, New York, United States",Donna Karan International Inc. is one of the leading international fashion design houses.,"327,372","Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",$100M to $500M,Active,1984-01-01,year,2016-07-25,day,,,For Profit,http://donnakaran.com,"Everything I do is a matter of heart, body and soul,” says Donna Karan, chief designer of the international company that bears her name. “For me, designing is an expression of who I am as a woman, with all the complications, feelings and emotions.” In fact, Karan credits her feminine instincts for the success of the company she founded in 1984 with her late husband Stephan Weiss, which went on to become a publicly–traded enterprise in 1996, and then five years later, was acquired by its present owner, the French luxury conglomerate, LVMH, Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton. Says Karan, “that I’m a woman makes me want to nurture others, fulfill needs and solve problems. At the same time, the artist within me strives for beauty, both sensually and visually. So design is a constant challenge to balance comfort with luxe, the practical with the desirable.” How Karan meets that challenge can run from the simplicity of a bodysuit (where it all began) to the artisan glamour of a limited edition hand-painted DeVoré dress. Whatever form the design takes, Karan will tell you it begins and ends with the body – its sensual expression, sense of security, and freedom of movement. A modern system of dressing, Karan’s concept is based on Seven Easy Pieces, where a handful of interchangeable items work together to create an entire wardrobe that goes from day to evening, weekday to weekend, season to season. “I’m designing for an international man and woman. A creative person who never knows where a day is going to take them,” says Karan. “That’s why New York is on the label. It sets the pace, the attitude.” Speaking in a multi-cultural language of fashion, Karan is inspired by the life and innate style of the artist. Quintessential hallmarks include black cashmere, leather, stretch and molded fabrics, often exclusively developed by Karan, as well as silhouettes that wrap and sculpt the body. For Karan, it’s never been just about clothes; it’s about lifestyles. She sees the entire picture from head-to-toe, from function to aesthetic. Handbags and shoes are designed right alongside the clothes. “How do I dress the leg?” inspired Donna Karan Hosiery. “The right bra?” Donna Karan Intimates. “The perfect glasses?” Donna Karan Eyewear. The list goes on to include belts, accessories and, as Karan puts it, “everything you need to pull yourself together.” Karan’s quest for the perfect jeans, as well as her desire to dress her daughter Gabby, resulted in the 1989 birth of DKNY. Fast fashion with an urban mind-set, DKNY is what Karan calls “the pizza to collection’s caviar.” DKNY grew so popular and diverse that other brands and labels spun from it, including DKNY Jeans, DKNY Active, DKNY Underwear, DKNY Jeans Juniors, and DKNY Kids. (Not surprisingly, Karan’s grandkids and friends’ kids had much to do with the latter). Like Collection, DKNY has an accessories and shoe collection to underscore its New York City street-smart style. Karan saw the many men in her life, starting with her husband, also needed a sophisticated system of dressing. Considering that Karan’s father was a custom tailor, DKNY Men emerged a year later in answer to his casual, sport side, which went on to launch its own dress shirt and tailored clothing collections. Determined to seduce all the senses, Karan took on the world of beauty in 1992 under the business and creative leadership of her husband, who designed the bottles and jars for the signature fragrances and their ancillary products. The beauty division went on to introduce best-selling fragrances. Completing the lifestyle approach to design, in 2001 Karan introduced a Donna Karan Home Collection “all about touch and feel,” which includes everything from luxe bedding and candles to cashmere throws, and DKNY Home, which accents interiors with fashion-forward bedding and accessories. There are also Donna Karan and DKNY Lenox Table and Giftware collections as well. Donna Karan international has an excess of two hundred company-owned and licensed free standing Donna Karan Collection, DKNY, and DKNY Jeans stores worldwide. The first flagships opened in London – DKNY in 1994, and Collection two years later. 1999 marked the opening of the uptown New York City DKNY flagship store, located at 60th street and Madison Avenue, and two years later, came the downtown DKNY flagship on West Broadway in SoHo. Bringing it back to where it all began, in 2001 Karan opened the Donna Karan New York flagship store, the premiere collection showcase, at 819 Madison Avenue. Designed as “a serene escape from the city’s chaos,” a dramatic indoor/outdoor river rock garden runs through the townhouse’s ground floor. For Karan, it literally and creatively began in New York. She was born into fashion on Long Island. Not only was her father Gabby Faske (who died when Karan was three) a tailor, her mother Helen was a showroom model and fashion sales rep. Even Karan’s stepfather Harold Flaxman was in the fashion business. So it was only natural that Karan, while still in high school, designed her first collection and staged her first show. Following her second year at Parson’s School of Design, Karan was hired by Anne Klein for a summer job. After three years as an associate designer, Karan was named successor following Klein’s death in 1974. Louis Dell’olio, a Parson’s friend, joined her a year later. Together, they designed the Anne Klein Collection. In a foreshadow of DKNY, Karan created Anne Klein II in 1982, originating the concept of bridge and lifestyle dressing in fashion. After ten years of designing Anne Klein, Karan was ready to go out on her own with the support of Weiss and partner Takiyho, Inc. The owner of Anne Klein & Co. Fall 1985 saw the first Donna Karan New York collection and the reaction from the press and retailers proved once again that Karan made fashion history.","Clothing and Apparel, Commerce and Shopping, Community and Lifestyle, Design",2,"Donna Karan, Stephan Weiss",1001-5000,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Based on this pioneering technology, our products and solutions cover several emerging markets – Cloud Wi-Fi, SDWAN, LBS, and data analytics. Our resilient architecture fulfills both functional and cost requirements, from single device deployment to large-scale cross-platform and cross-regional network services, making Abloomy a competitive player in SMB, enterprise and ISP markets. 	 Abloomy’s smart-edge based cloud WiFi solution combines the advantages of both on-premises and cloud-managed WLANs, bringing together simplicity, scalability, reliability, performance and security. In contrast with the traditional cloud WiFi solution, Abloomy pushes all wireless network functions and applications to its smart-edge gateway which is close to or even on-premises with the customers. This not only reduces the dependency on internet connection quality and the performance of the cloud DC, but also enables customers to seamlessly integrate cloud management with their company’s existing on-premises security policies and maintain data privacy, low latency and reliability. Unlike traditional hard-coded customized hardware and AC-based on-premises WLAN, with its smart-edge technology, Abloomy gives customers the flexibility to add more functions and applications without upgrading hardware. Abloomy’s cloud solution supports both private cloud and hybrid cloud, which makes it easier for multi-site businesses and ISPs to set up large scale networks. SDWAN efficiently connects the customer to the internet or IDC. End-to-end products and zero-touch deployment offer the best way to set up local distributed networks. Leveled multi-tenant accounts support the balance of management power between headquarters and each branch, and between ISPs and their end users.

Savor features a location-based mobile service called “Foodie Alerts” that can send personalized proximity notifications when a new place you wanted to try is around the corner or when an exceptional version of a favorite food or drink is close-at-hand. (“5-star Pistachio Gelato is in the vicinity!”) Savor uses sophisticated energy-saving algorithms that minimize battery consumption so you can run the app in the background and not miss discovering your next great dining experience. Savor’s “Feed” is a steady stream of crowdsourced reviews and images from our growing global user network of foodies. Users publish reviews using a quick and convenient posting method that makes it easy to identify, describe, rate, and share what they savor directly from their iPhones. All reviews are publicly available for other users to see, like, share, comment on, get info, or post again. Users can search for specific dishes, or explore by location, to find what’s best to eat and drink around them. Search results are conveniently sorted by average rating and date so the best and most current items appear first. Unlike restaurant-based apps, Savor answers the age-old question of what’s good on the menu or, better yet, what and where are the best dishes and drinks around me?","Content and Publishing, Data and Analytics, Food and Beverage, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Mobile, Navigation and Mapping",3,"Anil Bajaj, Arun Bajaj, Doug Dawirs",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
