It is theoretically akin to the earth's magnetic field and gravitational force, where the SST-enhanced network, or ""universal communications field"", lets users make continuous connections with others, as if sharing brain waves or even spiritual connections. b) Privacy/Control/Unstructured Communications: Our sixth-sense technology gives users complete control of inbound and outbound communications, for everything from privacy and anonymity to depth and breadth of the content s/he shares. Our technology enables users and devices to communicate, without reliance on or use of traditional contact information, or third-party platforms.

By contrast, digital distributors and social networks impose a set of structured rules for member participation, and frequently dictate an inverse correlation between privacy and breadth of communication. c) Our SST inventions overcome the limitations of current competitive technologies to satisfy the twin goals of public health safety and privacy, and will form the foundation of the new dial-tone to the Internet. d) Exposure-Notification Technology (ENT): PoKos SST enables anonymous digital communications, and is at the center of all current exposure notification, contact tracing, and mobile movement-tracking efforts (jointly, an ""Exposure Notification System"", or ""ENS"") to help public health authorities (PHAs) control the spread of the novel coronavirus, thanks to PoKos' patent-pending exposure-notification technology (ENT). For example, Canada's COVID Shield, Ireland's COVID Green, and the Apple/Google Exposure-Notification API (A/G API) are powered by ENT to be licensed from PoKos.  Similarly, the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) has announced its support for a new national ENS that gives the US public health community a capable and accountable partner for securely hosting computer servers nationwide, thereby eliminating duplication among the different sates and enabling notifications across state borders. Additionally, the Linux Foundation, the nonprofit organization enabling mass innovation through open source, has launched a new initiative to use open source technologies to help PHAs develop mobile-phone apps for exposure notification using the A/G API and ENT to be licensed from PoKos. e) SmartTarget(TM): patented technology powers digital ad targeting in a post-cookie world. f) SmartAware(TM): patented technology to authenticate and target devices nearby and worldwide, and maintain your privacy.  Gives users control of what/when/where/who they hear from and communicate with; and gives marketers edge to target and engage their best customers and prospects  Our technology has solved the engineering challenge; we have secured patents for the core communications inventions; and we have patent-pending protection for PoKos ENT.
