It is a central transaction website for all personal balance sheet items such as banking, investing, selling/buying assets, real estate, credit cards, personal loans, installment loans, real estate loans and business loans. Currently the market serves read only reporting but LoadedPocket will change the market for personal banking similar to Travelocity and Priceline of the travel industry.  The bulk of their revenue comes from affiliates, a significant portion from full-service fees and a fair portion in sales commissions from easy listings of personal assets for sale. While there is not a business in the market offering third party transactional software, there is also not a competitor for valuing all assets a person owns (cars, planes, boats, baseball cards, diamond rings, the toy in a happy meal), all those sales earn commissions for LoadedPocket. The service allows for two functions that other sites do not allow as well. Integration with estate planning software, and integration with geneology sites that captures a families net worth and not only their own. The application provides up-to-date reporting, managing financial reporting, valuing all personal assets. All income and expenses are auto-categorized for income and expense reporting. That means preparing taxes is a snap.  In summary, LoadedPocket is the Priceline and Travelocity of the financial services and banking industries where financial service companies bid for reducing a persons costs as well as allowing the ability to transact from all accounts to all accounts. The best part is that no other companies are doing this today.","Financial Services, Software",,,1-10,1,,14000,USD,14000,14000,USD,14000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

One of their most notable clients is Ford Motor Company where they are treating their automotive paint lines. Their fluidized bed concentrator (FBC) abatement system is an integral part of Ford’s ‘Fumes to Fuel’ initiative to utilize concentrated paint solvents from their exhaust to create energy. Their systems consist of an adsorber which removes volatiles from the airstream, and a desorber which releases the volatiles from the adsorbent media. The concentrated volatiles may then be condensed in recovery applications, or oxidized in destruction applications. The fluid bed technology is also a very cost effective option for odor abatement. Whether the application is VOC abatement, solvent recovery, or odor abatement, this technology provides the lowest operating cost, lowest energy use, and lowest secondary emissions (such as greenhouse gases) of any abatement technology available.","Energy, Manufacturing, Sustainability",,,51-100,2,,,,,530080,USD,530080,NYSERDA,,1,,Private,,,,,,
