We have secured an agreement with Royal Caridea L.L.C. to build a production facility in Western North Carolina. Our objective is to produce one million pounds of fresh organic shrimp and market it locally, with the intent to expand production as we move forward. Cost of building and operation until revenue can be realized will be in excess of 9.5 million dollars. We will be seeking investors and looking into Small Business Administration USDA loans for funding. Payback for this project is estimated to be 3-4 years with an average selling price per pound around $7.50 per pound.       Market competition is imported foreign head-off frozen shrimp. The US imports 5.5 billion dollars of shrimp annually from south East Asia, India and South America. Food safety is a major concern with foreign product. The ecological impact in producing countries has caused a decline in production in many of those countries. A devastating pathogen called Early Mortality Syndrome (EMS) has ravaged many production facilities completely wiping out shrimp production. Cost of shrimp has been escalating over the last few years and no relief is in sight. US pond farming has been on the rise, but is limited because of the low production rates and limited seasonal harvest. The production facility we propose is able to produce one million pounds of shrimp per year in staggered harvest in a climate controlled environment with automated feeding system, post-larvae nursery tanks, re-circulating filtration system and computer monitoring of critical metrics. The 20 stacked raceways will be constructed and consist of 7 rectangular ponds of 6-8 feet wide by 56 feet long  that will produce 428,000kg of shrimp annually.",Travel and Tourism,,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Partnering They will often take risks with their customers - tying their financial success of their customers. This is particularly important when they are providing strategic advice about what represents a marketable item - their customers know that they believe what they say because they take a stake in their success. Managerial Sometimes projects fail because the vision is not clear or because the leadership cannot gather the appropriate information and disseminate it. They work with their clients to develop products but also to make sure communication is working both up and down in the organization. Board of Directors They have taken a seat on the board of directors of some of their clients because of the quality and diversity of the assistance they provide. Tactical Aside from providing advice, they will also implement the strategies that they propose. This is especially important when a customer has tried and failed on his own in a particular area and needs something done quickly. Some of their technical expertise lies in: Mathematical Modeling (hold a patent in simulated annealing) Business Modeling (cost of operations analysis, ROI tools, process modeling) Compilers / language translators (makers of VB to C++ translator among other translators) Application Conversions (automatic and manual translations) Software Localization (developed methodology for D&B for translation into 19 languages) Performance Tuning (for several clients this has been algorithmic changes that resulted in orders of magnitude differences) Web sites (many such clients) Expert Systems (developed a high-end customer requirements/vendor capability mapping system) Clients They have helped companies from the size of Avaya, D&B and PaineWebber to companies of smaller size bring their products to market and manage their businesses.
