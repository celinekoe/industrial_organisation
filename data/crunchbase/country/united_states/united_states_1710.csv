After hours spent brainstorming, then searching WHOIS, contacting domain owners to find out if an unused name was for sale, negotiating outrageous and unjustified prices, then starting over again, we thought WHY ISN'T THERE A LIST OF NAMES THAT WE CAN CHOOSE FROM? And thus, BrandBucket was born.  Owners of brandable domain names can submit their names for consideration. Once accepted we will help set correct pricing and a member of our global community of logo designers will create a custom design to help portray what the name could look like when used as a business name.","Commerce and Shopping, Events, Financial Services, Media and Entertainment",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The capability of this product will allow anyone to clean a nearby water source quickly, efficiently and for long duration of time consisting of daily usage. Issues within the clean water industry range from lack of efficiency, cost, and adequate ways to provide people in need of these services and technology. The times of having to boil water, going through long tedious steps to filter water, or having to travel great distance with dirty water to go through the previously mentioned steps will be a thing of the past with this product. This, along with our mission to provide clean water to underdeveloped and underprivileged areas within developing and developed countries, is our driving force. Trinhydral believes that clean water shouldn’t clean out your wallet. We plan on making devices and leading in projects to make the perception of limitless useful water a reality for all. Trinhydral has planned income producing projects, like the Flint Project, to focus an alternative method for clean water besides the use of water bottles. The Trinhydral Filter will provide different variations, such as the Home Edition, Army Edition, Hiker Edition, and other interchangeable components. Each edition solves a common problem dealing with water; the Home Edition is for the household that cannot install a water filter at home, the Army Edition focuses on speed efficiency and uses electricity, and the Hiker Edition is more compact designed to fit inside a backpack, for easy travel and use. Trinhydral plans to capitalize on this opportunity by focusing on direct sells to nonprofit organizations/companies, charities, and government entities who are faced with this challenge and want to provide more than relief.
