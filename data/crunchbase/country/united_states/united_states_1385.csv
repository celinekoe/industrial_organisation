Hacking the President is a new historical fiction adventure thriller by author Edward Ben-Alec, available now on Amazon.  The 54th President of the United States, once an adopted Chinese orphan, is elected after a constitutional amendment.  What nobody knows including the President is that when she was a baby, she received implanted biotechnology for controlling her in the future.  Less than 24 hours into her presidency she is overwhelmed with commands to unleash hellish weapons on the American people by Chinese scientists who've been planning this for 40 years.  Scenes of American immigration from every corner of the Earth are interwoven through time - telling a riveting love story that takes places over a thousand generations.  All of this lays the groundwork for an epic battle and adventurous quest to dominate and control the President's very soul.   When it was written Hacking the President was designed as a movie and a great, enthralling movie it will be.  But first it has to get made.
