As a result of Al’s innovation, pilots continue to have the ability to control and monitor their engine’s fuel-air ratio. In 1965, Alcor patented the key component of the EGT system, the durable thermocouple, which remains one of Alcor’s most popular products today.

In addition, they learned that there's a seediness underlying the industry that is a result of the lack of legislation and regulation guiding the proper and ethical disposal of these materials. The result is that, more often than not, the ""bottom line"" dictates what happens to collected materials. Items with little recoverable value are landfilled — or worse — illegally exported to poor countries where they are incinerated causing massive environmental and ecological damage.  they decided that they will not be a party to this damage and refuse to let the bottom line compromise their ethics.
