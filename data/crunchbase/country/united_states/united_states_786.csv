That store titled “International Leather Source” specialized in wholesale and retail leather fashion. It gained popularity quick and drew a massive following from customers all over the United States. Fast forward 10 years we grew from 1 single store to 9 flagship locations around the Chicagoland and Wisconsin area.  Today, all of our focus is toward our eCommerce operations.  Simply put, we have noticed a growing trend of retailers selling overpriced, substandard items claiming to be “leather.” This, along with designers selling a name and ignoring quality, led us to believe that there needed to be a change. There had to be a cost effective method for the consumer to purchase high quality leather goods without the mark ups of a traditional retailer.

Blood is a charged solution and when it is pumped by the left ventricle, it causes fluid motion and volumetric changes. Therefore, by sending a current through the ascending aorta and measuring the change in resistance, one can deduce the amount of blood pumped by the heart (Cardiac Output). The ECOM® Monitor is attached to an ET (endotracheal) tube, which has an inflation cuff (balloon) located at its distal end allowing for tracheal occlusion and position anchoring. The cuff is located immediately proximal to the bifurcation of the trachea, which is in direct contact with the ascending aorta. The ascending aorta is the main blood vessel branch from the left ventricle and is therefore ideally suited for Cardiac Output measurements. There are transmitting and receiving electrodes located on the cuff and tube, which allows direct monitoring of impedance changes from the ascending aorta and provide different transmission directions. This eliminates any potential interference or anomalous signals from structures in the heart, lungs or other great vessels, thereby overcoming the inherent limitations of other systems. The monitor delivers an electrical current through the tracheal wall proximal to the balloon cuff and completes the circuit at the distal section of the cuff. The sensing electrodes can then create multiple geometrically configured pairs. When the blood is pumped by the left ventricle and is forced into the ascending aorta, the blood’s resistance to the current changes. The electrical current allows the volume change to be estimated and the amount of blood being pumped by the heart (Cardiac Output) to be determined.",Health Care,,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
