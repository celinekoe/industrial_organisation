Licenses and Accreditation: Ocean Beach Recovery is licensed by the Florida Department of Children and Families. In addition, we are an approved education provider through the Florida Certification Board, the Florida Department of Education and the National Association for Alcohol and Drug Addiction Counselors (NAADAC). Ocean Breeze Recovery is firmly committed to endorsing the prevention of drug and alcohol abuse. We firmly believe that drug and alcohol addiction is a completely preventable disease. This is supported by results from a recent National Institute of Drug Abuse funded research study which showed that prevention programs involving families, schools, communities, and the media are extremely effective in reducing drug and alcohol abuse. However, we do understand that many events and cultural factors affect drug and alcohol abuse trends. When youths perceive drug and alcohol abuse as harmful, they reduce or eliminate their drug and alcohol intake. That is why Ocean Breeze Recovery believes that education and outreach are the keys to helping youth and the general public understands the risks of drug and alcohol abuse. To assure these efforts teachers, parents, medical and public health professionals must keep driving home the message that drug and alcohol addiction can be prevented by abstinence.","Education, Health Care",1,Peter Cogan,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

FinalCode,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/finalcode,"Information Technology, SaaS, Security, Software","San Jose, California, United States","FinalCode delivers persistent file security in an easy, scalable and cost-effective platform that applies encryption.","840,950","San Francisco Bay Area, Silicon Valley, West Coast",$1M to $10M,Active,2014-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,http://www.finalcode.com/en,"Headquartered in San Jose, California and with a vision to provide users and organizations with easy, flexible and comprehensive way to secure files designed to be shared internally and externally – FinalCode has assembled an experienced, innovative team of cybersecurity experts and technologists to offer small-to-medium businesses, government agencies and large global enterprises a persistent means to secure sensitive files wherever they go. Conventional file security approaches provide access and usage controls within internal or cloud repositories and containers. They typically require file owners and recipients to share passcodes, utilize application-specific connectors, or have common systems and applications. And most Information Rights Management (IRM) systems require of IT staff considerable planning, infrastructure changes and on-going administrative investment. Not only are they difficult to expand within a company, they are challenging to invite external file collaborators. They disrupt business and user workflow… which why users often circumvent these systems and send files to others without adequate controls. FinalCode offers a file encryption and file-based enterprise digital rights management (eDRM) platform that is agnostic to file storage, distribution and content management. As such, FinalCode can work with popular applications, devices, cloud storage, content management systems, and collaboration tools. Offered as either a software as a service (SAAS) or on premise virtual appliance software , the solution can be flexibly deployed as needed for an individual, department, business project, or enterprise-wide. FinalCode offer persistent file protection with strong encryption and an extensive array of granular usage controls including file traceability and means to remotely delete files even after they have been distributed. More so, the approach preserves user experience by integrating within existing file sharing workflow and allowing the recipient to work in the applications they are used to. FinalCode for Box ensures persistent file access, usage control and deletion of files that are outside the secure Box container in a way that is seamless to Box collaborators. This SaaS add-on option for Box Enterprise and Business Edition users extends Box’s file governance to files leaving the secure Box repository. And by enabling file security that is directly invoked within the Box interface, FinalCode for Box combines tremendous usability with the convenience of fast, as needed deployment. Furthermore, since FinalCode file security is mapped to Box collaborator settings, users do not need to set their own security policy, it is done automatically.","Information Technology, Privacy and Security, Software",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
