Intrommune’s therapies are delivered through a platform that integrates simply into a person’s daily routine to enable them and their loved ones to live their lives without fear. The Company’s Oral Mucosal Immunotherapy (OMIT) platform is based on the well-accepted principles of immunotherapy. OMIT utilizes a specially formulated toothpaste that optimizes exposure of allergenic proteins to a patient’s immune system, while cleaning their teeth. The initial product in development is INT301 for the treatment of peanut allergy. The lack of treatments makes food allergies an area of tremendous unmet need. The FDA has only approved one product for any food allergy, a peanut allergy immunotherapy that requires you to ingest peanut protein. As desperate as patients are for solutions, due to significant adverse events and difficulty in administration, only 1 in 10 eligible patients are willing to ingest peanut protein. Nonetheless, the company was recently acquired for $2.6 billion. With minimal options, patients and caregivers must resort to attempting to avoid allergy-triggering foods in the often-futile hope of preventing severe allergic reactions. In short, patients, parents, providers and payors are all seeking a safe, efficacious, and easy to administer product such as INT301.

Transformational applications that have been “around the corner” for years like digital content creation, automated visual inspection, and augmented reality (AR), will be enabled by GSR.

For you technophiles: convergent technologies used in Quidient’s engines include light field physics, spatially sorted 5D databases, and imaging polarimetry. Polarimetric cameras, optionally used with Quidient Reality engines, can “see” the shape of the world from single images. AI/ML can be remarkably enhanced when it is based on 5D data.

Unfortunately, these Class IV patients, despite optimal drug therapy, have persistent symptoms and their options are very limited. Surgical approaches usually involve complex open-heart surgery or heart transplantation. Sunshine Heart’s C-Pulse® Heart Assist System is an innovative approach to assist the heart’s function, not replace it, and maybe implanted using a minimally invasive approach. The C-Pulse Heart Assist System is designed to treat clinical symptoms associated with Class III and ambulatory Class IV heart failure, sometimes also referred to as moderate and severe failure. Patients associated with Class III and ambulatory Class IV heart failure are typically unable to engage in normal activities, compromising their quality of life. The C-Pulse System uses proven balloon counter-pulsation technology to assist the heart by reducing the workload of the left ventricle. During inflation of the balloon, blood flow is increased to the coronary arteries, thereby providing additional oxygen which is vital to a failing heart. During deflation, the workload, or pumping required by the left heart is reduced. The balloon inflation and deflation are synchronized to the patient’s heartbeat, similar to a pacemaker. Potential benefits of the technology are relief of shortness of breath, increased physical activity, improved cardiac function, enhanced mobility, and improved quality of life. Physicians have commented that patients experience some of these benefits almost immediately after device placement.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",1,William Peters,101-250,14,IPO,76082398,USD,76082398,76442398,USD,76442398,"GBS Ventures, Talu Ventures",,2,1,Public,2012-02-24,,,CHFS,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/sunshine-heart-ipo--c323beeb,NASDAQ
