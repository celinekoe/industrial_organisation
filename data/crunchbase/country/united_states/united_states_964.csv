Once that has been made possible the rest of the key features become much easier deliver.  We have basically a “black box” style recorder, which has the capability to communicate with any consumer communication product irrespective of the type or operating system for the purpose distributing a live lecture or meeting data feed in real time.  The end user may then add their other comments, annotations, questions, or other such interactions to that data feed as they see fit. There are four main products associated with PolyInnovations.  The portable boxed hardware server platform which includes everything the client needs to get setup quickly.  We feel this product is going to make up the bulk of the sales numbers for the first few years.  If the client has an existing server with adequate coverage they could buy only the software as an installation client.  Both products come with the third product which is a need to purchase a software license and maintenance agreement.  It has been priced reasonably but it will be an annual requirement.
