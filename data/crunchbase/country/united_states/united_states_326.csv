Yet so much attention has been paid to the introduction of 4G LTE mobile services and the excitement ahead of 5G that the fixed broadband sector has often been reduced to second billing. But UBB plays a starring role in its own right. Without reliable, quality broadband connections running at ultra-broadband speeds, the Gigabit Society will never reach its potential, smart cities won't be so smart, the Internet of Things (IoT) will be fragmented, 5G will be a flop (and miss the 2020 deadline now inextricably tied to its emergence) and exciting services video services such as Ultra HD and virtual reality will struggle to become mass market phenomena. Gigabit broadband is the service that connects the cloud to businesses and individuals and provides the link between mobile access network infrastructure and the wider world with which it needs to have assured connectivity. That's why developments in UBB technology and services â think G.fast, DOCSIS 3.1, NG-PON2, dark fiber, vectored copper, gigabit broadband, the impact of virtualization on broadband access networks â have never been more important. And that's why the industry needs the Broadband World News community, which will track, analyze and report on all the major developments in the high-speed broadband communications market, identifying the key trends and talking to the movers and shakers who are transforming the sector and introducing next-generation technologies, services and strategies that will transform the global broadband market by 2020 (and beyond). Light Reading and the Broadband World Forum (BBWF) have been tracking the development and evolution of the broadband sector, from ADSL to TWDM-PON, since 2002 and have a wealth of expertise and knowledge that has enabled us to identify and track trends, gain access to key decision makers and market movers and provide unrivalled analysis and insight into UBB developments. So it makes sense that the community will be the online portal that provides year-round coverage of a market that meets at the annual Broadband World Forum event. The community site will provide year-round coverage of the key topics explored at BBWF -- and there's a great deal to discuss, analyze and understand as network operators seek to build the networks and develop the services that will cater to the needs of an always-connected, video-hungry, cloud-oriented user base.
