With long-term care therapy as their foundation, Valir Consulting & Billing Services was added to provide seminar-based education, on-site consulting, and billing expertise to the healthcare community. In May 2004, Valir purchased an 81-bed inpatient rehabilitation hospital in midtown Oklahoma City with a focus on enhancing their existing outpatient therapy services division. Since that time, they have formed an expansive network of outpatient clinics, now 13 strong, located within the Oklahoma City and surrounding areas. Valir introduced its Hospice division in response to a need for a higher level of hospice care. Valir is proud of the world-class team of caregivers who are gifted in handling the end-of-life process for patients and their families. In an effort to improve the health of businesses and communities they operate in, Valir extended the outpatient therapy division to include Workforce Wellness. This program is intended to reduce health care costs, increase productivity, reduce absenteeism and create a positive return on the employee investment. Their efforts have allowed employers become more productive while lowering overall costs. Driven by their motto, “Do the right thing,” Valir has continued to grow through positive physician and patient referrals and strong business relationship development. As a result, Valir has become a market leader in each of their service lines with patient outcomes among the best in the country.
