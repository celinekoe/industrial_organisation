StreetJelly is about people, musicians actually. Take “LanaEve,” for instance, who performs often on StreetJelly.  She’s a teenage prodigy from Nashville.  Despite this sounding like a cliche, she really has the voice of an angel.  Want to see the most genuine happy smile?  Say “hello” to her and drop her a token.  Then there’s “Maestro” from Seattle, an accomplished musician and music teacher from School of Rock.  Maestro will draw you in with his soothing piano and guitar originals.  Before you know it, time has flown by and your day is much better.  There’s also folk music duo Rick and Denise called “Amaranth.” They put on weekly shows from their home for friends and family around the country.

We aim to provide Desi lifestyle/culture and music in a format that cannot be found anywhere else. Desi Hits! aims to make South Asian culture more widely dispersed and understood as well as offering a platform for South Asian artists to promote themselves globally. Desi Hits! draws on the multicultural backgrounds of our target audience, namely the â€œDesiâ€, who can often be described as bilingual, trendy, cosmopolitan and as likely to jive to Madonna as they are to Bollywood. We focus heavily on bi-cultural remixes as they uniquely represent the next generation (and beyond) South Asian experience. Itâ€™s an exciting time for the South Asian community, particularly as the cross pollination of cultural heritage is spilling into the mainstream. Icons such as Aishwarya Rai and pop idols such as M.I.A. point to a new hybrid pop vernacular that represents South Asians everywhere. The impact on global pop can be seen by the fact that artists such as Britney Spears, Madonna, Jay-Z and Timbaland have put a South Asian spin to their music and are working with Desi producers and artists. The Desi Hits! offering, however, is not exclusively South Asian. Desi Hits! covers mainstream as well as bicultural news, music, interviews and lifestyle content with a global perspective since the next generation Desi wants it all and is currently forced to go to multiple vendors to get it. To that end, Desi Hits! will just as soon cover Usher and P Diddy as it would up and coming South Asian artists like Jay Sean and Rishi Rich or even Bollywood.","Community and Lifestyle, Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio, Video",1,Anjula Acharia Bath,11-50,2,Early Stage Venture,6000000,USD,6000000,6000000,USD,6000000,"Trident Capital, D.
