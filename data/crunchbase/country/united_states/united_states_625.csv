Their patented surgical platform technology allows us to remove tissue or biopsy samples in the most compassionate, effective and efficient manner possible. Their initial product launch – the patented ATEC™ (Automated Tissue Excision and Collection) breast biopsy and excision system – has made exciting new clinical advancements in the areas of vacuum assisted diagnostic breast biopsy. Suros is proud to be the only company in the world with a commercially available MRI-guided vacuum assisted breast biopsy system that allows women in a high-risk population the opportunity for early diagnosis without going to surgery. For the more than 1.2 million women who undergo breast biopsy every year, this is good news. Suros also offers the first and only 9 gauge petite needle for women with small breasts and a true 12 gauge needle – giving physicians the world’s smallest needle to perform the world’s fastest breast biopsy. At Suros, they believe patients are better served with a minimally invasive approach to biopsy or surgery. The ATEC™ system offers measurable improvements in speed, reliability, clinical capabilities, safety, economic return, and ease of use. Simply stated, the ATEC™ is the choice both physicians and women have been waiting for – a breast biopsy system compatible under any imaging modality and first-ever technology that allows women a chance at outpatient breast biopsy methods with reduced pain and trauma, and with no scarring or post-op recovery time. Suros never stops improving its technology and is always looking for new, innovative ways of providing the most compassionate patient care on many clinical levels.
