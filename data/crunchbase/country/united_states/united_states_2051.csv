Unlike services offered by ADT and other security companies, CameraFTP service is extremely easy to setup, the cost is extremely low, and with its cloud-based technology, you can remotely monitor the scene or play back the recorded footage from anywhere on any device. Because the data is stored in CameraFTP's secure data center, it is far more secure than traditional security services. Today, network security cameras are no longer expensive or complicated. By utilizing low-cost network cameras and CameraFTP service, consumers and businesses can enjoy better service than traditional CCTV security systems at a much lower cost. CameraFTP also offers software based security camera for free. With our software, you can turn a webcam, a smartphone or a tablet into a network security camera at no cost! Under the hood, CameraFTP offers a special FTP service that is fully optimized for network security cameras. It supports almost all network cameras and software-based security cameras. CameraFTP is operated by Drive Headquarters, Inc. (DriveHQ). Based in Silicon Valley, DriveHQ is the first Cloud IT Solution provider, offering a wide range of cloud IT services. DriveHQ is also one of the largest FTP hosting service providers. A conventional FTP server that runs on a Linux or Windows server cannot support tens of thousands of users; however, CameraFTP's FTP server can easily handle tens of millions of users.  CameraFTP is different from any regular FTP services. A network camera may automatically upload images or videos to the FTP server every second. Compared with a regular person, who probably only uploads a few files per day, a network camera can create 100 times or even 1000 times more load than a regular person. To support millions of network cameras, an FTP system must be extremely efficient and scalable. Built on DriveHQ’s highly scalable FTP platform, CameraFTP offers more optimized service to network camera users. The service is more reliable, more efficient, more functional and more secure than any regular FTP services.","Hardware, Information Technology, Privacy and Security",1,John Zhang,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
