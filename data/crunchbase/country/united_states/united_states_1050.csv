Women ask questions and single out guys based on how they respond. Men cannot message women until women give permission. Customer Pain 1. Women being inundated with offensive messages on dating apps. 2. Women and men are overloaded with connections. Less than 10% message each other and less than 1% meet in real life. 3. Women and men have no context and therefore do not have anything to talk about when matching. Their Solution By putting women in the driver’s seat we create a better experience for everyone. When men feel as if they have been hand-picked they are more inclined to take the interaction seriously and less inclined to send offensive messages. Target Market They target college and graduate students between the ages of 18-26.The total college and graduate student market is about 24 million, and the twenty-something crowd exceeds 50 million people. Revenue Model They use in-app currency called Golden Tickets to allow users to make internal purchases.With GoldenTickets women can (a) increase their visibility (b) refine their matches, and (c) customize their profile and questions. Men can use Golden Tickets to (a) explain their answers and (b) give virtual gifts to women. They also accrue revenue through banner advertising. Go-to-Market Their “top-down” approach uses major social media to target users by age, location, gender, and university. Their “bottom-up” approach creates stickiness on college campuses by having foot traffic. They launched on a single college campus and within 10 days they were able to get 2,000 users (at 1/10th the cost of industry standard). Their users have posted and responded over 22,000 times within that 10 day period. Management Team The entire team has previously worked together in the same space on SetMeUp, which connected users to new people through mutual friends. At SetMeUp, they raised a 500k seed round to scale to 30,000+ users and 68 million profiles. They brought on the early-stage founder of Match.com. They recently closed down the app to refocus their efforts on the Singled Out app, since this is more responsive to the current problems women face in today’s dating market.","Apps, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Software",1,Jay Wadhwani,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
