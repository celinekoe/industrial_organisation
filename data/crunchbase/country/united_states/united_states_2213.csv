The Magfast Family comes with six chargers, covering every charging situation, and promises easy and quick charging for all your mobile devices. All of Magfast’s power banks come with a self-storing and replaceable built-in cable, traditional USB-A and new USB-C outlets, as well as wireless charging. While each individual Mgafast charger can work on its own, the system’s modular design allows you to connect multiple units together for “easy and rapid charging without wires.” There’s the LifeCharger, a portable powerbank that is easy to charge and can easily charge any device, all while fitting in the palm of your hand. Then, there’s the LifeCharger Extreme, which boasts the maximum power allowed by FAA law — that’s enough to jump start your car. Then, you have the RoadCharger, which when plugged into your 12v outlet gives you 4 USB outlets for you and your carmates to charge your devices with. As for AirCharger, this device supports wireless charging, and promises to be “perfect for the kitchen or office.” The WallCharger claims to provide a station for wireless charging not only for your mobile devices, but for the whole family of Magfast chargers as well. And finally, if you have an Apple Watch, the TimeCharger is for you. “There’s two problems with most chargers today,” said Seymour Segnit, Magfast founder and CEO. “They’re ugly with all those messy wires, which is no good in your environment — and most are so cheaply made they quickly go to landfill, which is really bad for everyone’s environment.” “Magfast is changing charging for good with world-class design and the best manufacturing, so these products will really last,” Segnit continued.
