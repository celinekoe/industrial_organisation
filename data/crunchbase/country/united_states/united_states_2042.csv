It’s specifically designed for collaboration and content curation in flipped or online learning environments.   Open Assembly is tackling a big gap in education technology: the absence of truly permeable open courseware. Existing courseware offerings (open and proprietary) are not designed for collaborative learning and instruction, and they’re difficult for students and educators to reuse or adapt to local needs. Nor do they accommodate today’s participatory culture. Open Assembly allows instructors to customize or adapt digital curricula, collaborate with colleagues or peers, and personalize instruction. It helps students become creators, not consumers, of learning content, encourages responsible content sharing and curation, and facilitates the development of collaborative skills.  By leveraging the inherent shareability of open educational resources (OER), Open Assembly engages instructors and students in the production, transmission, and broadcasting of knowledge--co-teaching, co-learning, co-researching. OER make this truly possible, at little or no cost.  Open Assembly complements existing OER products, services, and initiatives such as MIT OpenCourseWare, OpenStax College, Lumen Learning, MERLOT, Connexions, and others—with a toolkit that combines functionalities that have not been integrated into a single product, until now: --easily reuse, adapt, and revise open courseware (e.g. MIT OCW) as modular course templates; --assemble learning playlists with unbundled, chapter-level content from peer-reviewed open textbooks and proprietary content;  --curate additional content, including rich media, from within a course or project;  --share content with anyone else, inside or outside of a given course or project; --engagement analytics. Open Assembly gives every educator the opportunity to be a learner, and every learner the opportunity to become an educator. Users are not required to identify themselves as instructors or students: it is just as likely that a user could be administering a course as participating in one.","Education, Media and Entertainment, Software",1,Domi Enders,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The IT administrator applies patches once to a master virtual machine. Upon republishing, the changed data is streamed to NxTop PCs running the virtual machine. A patched image is assembled in  the background and  transparently loaded on the next reboot.  IT can also easily rollback a patch. Integrated Security AES-256 Disk Encryption. All virtual machine and system data on NxTop- enabled PCs can be encrypted, providing peace of a mind in the event that a PC containing sensitive data is lost or stolen. Policy Controls. IT administrators can protect against data leakage and  unauthorized  use through a  robust set of policy controls.  Access to hardware such as  USB ports and network interfaces can be restricted  or filtered  based on centrally  defined policies at global, group, and individual-user  levels. Virtual machines can be  governed by time-based  expiration  policies and  on-demand remote disablement. Remote Termination  with  Data Destruction. As an added layer of security, IT administrators can flag lost PCs for remote termination. If  a  lost  or  stolen  PC  connects  to  a  network, it  is directed  to digitally  shred all data and  encryption keys, then self- destruct. Hassle-Free Data Backup and Restore Transparent Data Protection. Based on   centrally  defined policies, NxTop periodically initiates  data backup with no  end-user interaction required. Efficient Data Transmission. NxTop   backup  technology captures changes at the block level, transmitting only the blocks that have changed to NxTop Center. Advanced  Management for Distributed Organizations Intelligent Remote Office Caching. Downstream management servers may be deployed at remote offices to intelligently cache and distribute updates for more efficient bandwidth utilization. Local Backup Storage.  User data backups may be  localized at remote offices, speeding system recovery and  avoiding unnecessary strain on wide area network links. Remote Helpdesk. Simply  enable remote  support  from  the  NxTop  Center  console  for  immediate remote PC control even in the event of a catastrophic operating system failure such as a Windows blue screen of death.","Hardware, Information Technology, Software",2,"Alex Vasilevsky, Dan McCall",5001-10000,3,M&A,24000000,USD,24000000,24000000,USD,24000000,"Citrix, Highland Capital Partners, Flybridge",2,3,,Private,,,,,,

FitDeck Mobile is a fitness application that runs on mobile devices (including Android, BlackBerry and iPhone) and provides an effective and convenient full-body workout that can be done anywhere, anytime. It presents a unique set of exercises in a program with structure and variety that is as fun and easy to use as a deck of cards. What exercises are included in the FitDeck Mobile application? FitDeck Mobile's flagship title, Bodyweight, contains 50 body-weight resistance exercises that require no weights or special equipment to perform, so they can be done in virtually any setting (office, home, gym, hotel room, park, etc.). The individual exercises are categorized by body region and have strength, flexibility, and cardio components to ensure a comprehensive, full-body workout. Pilates, Office and Stairs are also currenlty available. Other FitDeck Mobile titles that are coming soon include: Navy SEAL, Dumbbell, Exercise Ball, Stretch, Combat Sports, Yoga, Resistance Tube, Kettlebell, Pull Up, Junior, Firefighter, Balance Dome, Senior, Travel, Toning Ball, Postnatal, Exercise Bar, Superman, Playground, Prenatal, Baby Stroller, TRX Suspension Trainer, Medicine Ball, Speed, Agility, Quickness, CrossTrain, Plyometrics, Speed Ladder, Vertical Jump, Core Blast, and Cones. What are examples of some of the exercises? FitDeck Mobile features many innovative exercises with unique body positions and movements along with surprising and interesting variations on more traditional exercises like push-ups, jumping jacks, and sit-ups. Mixed together, these exercises are remarkably effective at conditioning major muscle groups and joints from head to toe, as well as targeting those muscles you never knew you had. To learn more, download a free trial at www.fitdeckmobile.com. What type of person is FitDeck Mobile intended for? FitDeck Mobile provides a great workout for people of all fitness and activity levels because it offers several different intensities â€“ beginner, intermediate and advanced â€“ to suit any user's present level and keep them challenged as they advance. Additionally, variations on certain exercises are suggested to better match each user's ability. What mobile devices are currently compatible with FitDeck Mobile? FitDeck Mobile is available now for BlackBerry and Android along with an increasing majority of other cell phones and mobile devices. FitDeck Mobile for the Apple iPhone/iPod Touch is expected to be available by March 2011. How do I know if it will work on my mobile device? Potential users can visit www.fitdeckmobile.com and use the device selection wizard to check for compatibility with FitDeck Mobile. From that point, a fully functional trial version of the product can be installed in most cases, so the user can take a test drive to see how it functions and get in a few workouts at no cost. Where can I buy FitDeck Mobile and how much does it cost? FitDeck Mobile is available from the FitDeck Mobile website (www.fitdeckmobile.com), as well as other App Stores including: Android Market and BlackBerry App World. In any case, the one-time purchase of under $10 gives unlimited access to any available FitDeck Mobile title. That means that for less than you'd pay for a single month at a gym, you get lifelong fitness benefits that go with you anywhere your mobile device does. Why did mobileXware develop FitDeck Mobile? The founders of mobileXware are into health and fitness and are also accustomed to an on-the-go lifestyle. They use FitDeck Mobile regularly and wanted to share this easy and effective fitness concept with like-minded consumers. People have their mobile devices with them everywhere these days, so why not utilize that technology to ensure that fitness remains a part of their ever more hectic lives? How does FitDeck Mobile relate to FitDeck cards and other products? Through a growing partnership, FitDeck Mobile takes the same great content (developed by a certified personal trainer/Navy SEAL) featured in the FitDeck exercise playing cards and delivers it in a convenient digital form. Regardless of the format, the FitDeck workouts provide the ultimate combination of simplicity, effectiveness, and convenience that is unmatched by any other product.","Apps, Health Care, Mobile, Platforms, Real Estate, Software, Sports",2,"Jason Ryer, Joel Lenorovitz",1-10,1,Seed,120000,USD,120000,120000,USD,120000,"Techstars, Nike+ Fuel Lab",,2,,Private,,,,,,

The DCA provides the public with information on safe consumer practices, in an effort to protect the public from unscrupulous or unqualified people who promote deceptive products or services. DCA licenses or certifies practitioners in more than 255 professions. There are currently more than 2.4 million practitioners licensed by the DCA. The Department consists of more than 40 bureaus, boards, committees, commission, and other entities that license and regulate practitioners. Regulatory duties include investigating complaints against licensees and disciplining violators. Boards, committees, and commissions operate independently but rely on DCA for administrative support. In 2015, an investigation was launched by the DCA's Division of Investigation into the Board of Vocational Nursing and Psychiatric Technicians. An unknown number of Enforcement cases were illegally mishandled and private data from those cases was illegally shared. This event prompted the CA Legislature to make unprecedented changes to the BVNPT's enforcement authority in bills AB 179 & AB 1229. Further public releases about this incident have been scant. As of 3/7/18, those nurses and psychiatric technicians have not been notified that their cases were mishandled and private data shared. Fees paid by licensees fund DCA operations almost exclusively. Bureaus, programs, divisions, and offices are under the full control of DCA.","Government and Military, Other, Social Impact",,,1001-5000,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
