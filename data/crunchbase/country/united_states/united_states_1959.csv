Our mission is to provide solutions to support the management of public infrastructure systems (Water, Waste, Air, and Land quality) to improve national safety. For example in the United States alone there are 155,000 public drinking water systems that supply water to 320 million people.  In 2011 (latest data), those suppliers were reported to have made 196,110 violations of the EPA regulations in regards to the Clean Water and Clean Drinking Water Act.  OPS is designing WaterOPS to manage the complex task of meeting regulatory requirements in harmony with daily operations.  Our approach is one of integrating all levels of system operations from field inspectors, laboratories, and management through an intuitive program breaking down complicated regulations into manageable daily tasks.  This scalable solution is capable of managing the operational needs for:- -Monitoring & recording hundreds of thousands of samples per day -Assimilating data into alerts and reports to rapidly inform key personnel -Provide information on trends and advisory notices -Even predict violations before they happen The core engine of our solution is being designed to support the entire USA water system network of drinking water providers, with a particular focus on providing an affordable service for the vast majority of system operators (143,000) that are still using outmoded paper based logging (over 60% in a recent market survey).  It will then be used to manage other crucial environmental monitoring systems impacting public safety, such as solid/water/hazardous waste, air quality, and land/agricultural/farm monitoring. Not only this, OPS is building a geo-referenced knowledgebase to help municipalities deal with the encroaching issue that 70% of Water Operators are now only within 5-7 years of retirement and have few resources to transfer that knowledge into a format for the next generation. We believe the solutions under development will even have worldwide advantages in supporting environmental monitoring in developing countries due to its cost-effectiveness.","Information Technology, Internet Services",5,"Charles Rowe, Evan Chou, Lee Beauchamp, Matt Beard, Tim Gantzhorn",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
