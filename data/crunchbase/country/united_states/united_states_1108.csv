Meanwhile, the majority of Nebraskans could decide that it’s a revolution. But why take our word for it… why not just ask them for yourself? With Polltopia, you’ll be equipped with that exact ability—to ask anything to anybody. You’re able to create an unlimited amount of polls for the world to vote in. Then, you can view statistical information about the people that voted in your poll. You can see that in a certain poll, 75% of men voted one way as opposed to 25% of women, or that New York voted much more in favor of a certain option than Texas did, or that those who were 45 and older tended to vote with some sort of consistency, different than that of their younger counterparts. Use this information for your research, curiosity, or pure enjoyment. Users are also able to comment on polls, so everything doesn’t have to be so black and white (or green, yellow, pink, blue or red, depending on how many options you decide to put in your poll). As a voter, use Polltopia to allow your voice to be heard. Democracy does exist in this world, but not to the extent in which people all over can be represented regarding any number of issues—from an extremely important and sensitive political stance, to a mere preference in sodas.
