Automation Works integrates equipment from different manufacturers and coordinates the operation of each component using skills in process control, automatic identification, database design and data communications.

With offices in Tucson-AZ, Portland-OR and Albuquerque-NM, the company has built a reputation for designing “worry-free” solar-electric systems, as every project comes with a 10-Year Installation Warranty, a 25-Year Panel Performance Warranty with Lifetime Production Monitoring. Because of its long trajectory of building quality solar-electric systems, Stelcor Energy was granted SunPower Dealer status in 2010 – an achievement given only to those integrators that are committed to a higher standard of performance, integrity and customer satisfaction. Stelcor Energy has also built an impressive resume of successfully completed commercial and school solar projects and in the process, developed strategic partnerships with manufacturers, structural steel erectors, and some of the strongest lending institutions in the country.  Our current 2014 commercial-solar backlog consists of 4.1 Megawatts worth of projects totaling $11.3M in revenue. The list includes (3) Arizona charter-school projects currently at final-contract stage and worth $2.2 million (860 kW) and (10) LOI-secured deals worth an additional $9.1 million (3.3 Megawatts). Stelcor Energy's unique and proven ability to enter into new markets by initiating a low-cost, high-energy sales initiative and quickly generating a backlog of projects and revenue, allows for it to enter into targeted market-areas with minimal cost and establish the financial footing required to build a permanent solar-sales presence.","Energy, Sustainability",1,Robert Charette,11-50,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

AB uses the historical data of users and bars to recognize patterns and to predict behavior to enhance a user’s experience and to automate bar marketing.    American Bars’ consumer facing app, which is always free to consumers, allows people to find great bars all over the US, along with a lot of other cool functions.

Then, we use their behavioral data to send bars new customers who are predisposed to their type of bar.   Getting consumers to download the app comes directly from bars in large part.  Bars, from either their dashboards or their bar owner app, can upload customer lists or add them individually.  AB is  also integrating with POS systems and using Credit Card data to export customers to the AB system.  Once they do add the customer(s), AB determines whether or not a user has downloaded the AB app.  If they have not, we send a text and a download link asking the user to download the app to follow that specific bar.  When they do download the app, we automatically add that bar as one of their favorites.  If the user already has downloaded the app, AB adds the bar as one of their favorites.  Then, anytime the bar adds an event or has a new special, the customer is notified and it is automatically posted to social media platforms.","Data and Analytics, Events, Food and Beverage, Media and Entertainment, Travel and Tourism",2,"Brian Smith, Tobias Cornelius Schopf",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
