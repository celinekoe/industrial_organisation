They are the best selling hip-hop group in music today, having sold over 26 million albums worldwide. In fact, they are one of the planet's most popular artists, and have toured more countries than any other artist. will.i.am is not only the group's lead MC and its creative engine, but also an fashion designer, actor, social activist, and incredibly sought-after producer who has worked with everyone from U2 to Nas to Flo Rida. The group's singing sensation, Fergie, has, in just a few short years, evolved into an actress, spokeswoman and fashion icon. Taboo and apl.de.ap, who started the group with will.i.am in the early ‘90s, have served as cultural ambassadors and have extended their hands into the worlds of acting and philanthropy. And together, the four parts of The Black Eyed Peas have grown the group into an unparalleled story of accomplishment. But now, the moment has come for The E.N.D. No, it is not time for The Black Eyed Peas to call it quits. The E.N.D. is The Energy Never Dies, the fifth studio album from the Los Angles-based quartet, and the group's most adventurous-sounding effort to date. It is an album that has the unmistakable club bounce and playful lyrical fervor fans have come to expect from the Black Eyed Peas. But it is also an album inspired by the underground world of electro and rock-infused house music, artists like Boyz Noize and DJ David Guetta (who both appear on The E.N.D.), Justice and A-Trak, and a world populated by raucous, all-night dance parties that are bubbling right now in every major city around the globe. The end is more than just a new sound for BEP, says will.i.am. He describes the album's title as not about anything ending at all, but about the transformation of energy at a time of change. ""We are in the middle of a really defining time right now,"" he says. ""It's the end of the traditional era of how we experience and consume music and media.It's the end of the stereotype that we could never have a black President. It's the end of the usual ways of receiving information. But it's also the beginning of a whole new cultural birth. So the title, The E.N.D. is not just about a new Black Eyed Peas sound but a celebration that change is happening.","Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio",1,William Adams,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The Center's mission is to inspire entrepreneurism and catalyze commercialization of UCSD inventions through grants, education and business mentoring. Commercializing early stage technologies is a very difficult and long process. However, in six years, the von Liebig Center has achieved remarkable results: it has received more than 200 proposals and invested more than $3.8M in seed grants and advisory services to over 70 projects. These projects have resulted in more than 22 license agreements and helped launch 16 start-up companies. In turn, those start-ups have attracted more than $78 million in subsequent capital from the private sector and created over 130 new jobs. The Center mentors a broad range of projects in areas including medical devices/diagnostics, software, and clean technologies. These projects result in companies and products with far-reaching impacts for sustainability, healthcare and other areas that ultimately improve quality of life. Examples include an improved screening test for the human papillomavirus associated with cervical cancer, technologies that improve the treatment of shock and acute inflammatory diseases, alternative power sources based on heat to electricity conversion and next generation energy efficient lighting devices. The Center's popular entrepreneurism courses have attracted over 400 graduate and undergraduate students, some of whom have also completed internships with the Center. Many of these von Liebig alumni have gone on to successful careers as entrepreneurs or business development professionals where they foster a culture of innovation and cooperation across disciplines.","Data and Analytics, Design, Education, Media and Entertainment",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
