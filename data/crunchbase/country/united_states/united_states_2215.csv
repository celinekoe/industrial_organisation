They are two things that we usually compromise for in beauty, but Kirsten knows how to celebrate the seeming opposites in life. ""Scandinavia has a calmness, a minimalism. New York City is fierce.” She says, “They seem like they are so different but they can work together. Kjaer Weis is both. A trailblazer, merging these two worlds of luxury and sustainability without compromise. We are making the new norm."" INGREDIENTS THAT WORK Whether it’s developing a lip color based off the hue of an old tee-shirt or personally inspecting each new batch for consistency in color and texture, Kjaer Weis ensures that not only are all our ingredients Certified Natural or Certified Organic, but that they always reach the standards of luxury beauty. That means makeup that really works and works with your skin, not against it. BEAUTY THAT KEEPS ON GIVING Just having an ecologically and health conscious product is not enough. When designing our sustainable packaging, we wanted something that looked and felt luxurious, not just another thing to discard. Award-winning creative director Marc Atlan did just that, creating an architecturally stunning bold, metal compact that can be easily refilled with your favorite KW product. The metal compacts, inscribed with white enamel “KW” logos, are housed in a red lacquer, grain-textured cases similar to jewelry boxes. Like a true relic, these compacts hold weight and will last - the perfect embodiment of how beauty, luxury and sustainability can coexist.",Consumer Goods,1,Kirsten Kjaer Weis,11-50,2,Early Stage Venture,,USD,,,USD,,"Waldencast, Finn Capital Partners",1,2,,Private,,,,,,

Herbfluence thrives on our proprietary technology, a robust network of cannabis social media influencers, an easy-to-use self service platform, exceptional customer service, and an incredible team with over 25 years experience in the cannabis industry. For brands in the cannabis industry, digital advertising opportunities are extremely limited. Google, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter all currently ban advertising for cannabis related companies. Companies are forced to rely upon outdated forms of advertising such as magazines, tv, radio, and billboards. Despite the limited advertising channels available, many cannabis brands have started to use influencer marketing as an effective means of digital marketing. Although it has proven to be very effective, many companies are unable to implement successful influencer marketing campaigns. Finding, connecting, negotiating, and compensating influencers can be an extremely tedious and timely process which often results in a low return on investment and ultimately a waste of time and money for a brand’s marketing department. Their solution is to offer an easy-to-use self-service platform that allows brands to connect with a network of cannabis-related social media influencers to promote products and services to cannabis consumers directly on their mobile devices.
