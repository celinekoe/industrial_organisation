The Company has three products scheduled for production: •The SunDuo™ T16 is a roof or ground mounted solar/thermal system with low cost combined heat and power. •The SunDuo™ G16 is a ground-mounted solar/thermal system for uneven terrain ideal for off-grid applications. •The SunTrio™ combines either the T16 or the G16 with a desalination system built to Beltane’s specification and private label manufactured for distribution. SunDuo™ creates electricity and hot water from a solar photovoltaic and thermal receiver. Reflectors concentrate sunlight, reducing the PV cells required by 93%. The receiver captures the valuable thermal energy produced by cooling PV cells so they operate more efficiently. The thermal energy is used by C&I CHP customers to offset the cost of their water heating requirements. Integrated tracking collects 30-40% more energy throughout the day and collects 60-100% more energy during peak utility demand charge periods in the late afternoon. We have determined that the scalable SunDuo™ has the lowest levelized cost of electricity in its market and the highest IRR in its class. SunTrio™ systems are designed for the distributed desalination market for the production of agricultural, industrial and drinking water. It provides a scalable distributed solution combining SunDuo™ collectors with proven, private labeled desalination systems. The point-of-use system is deployable in underserved areas that have extensive brackish water resources. Unlike brick-and-mortar facilities, the SunTrio™ does not require infrastructure and pipelines. The cost of water produced by a fossil fuel dependent desalination plant will increase with inflation but a solar powered system fixes energy costs over a 20 plus year period in locations without affordable energy or a grid. The SunTrio™ is designed to be installed in a short period of time with minimal or no permitting and can be redeployed elsewhere.","Agriculture and Farming, Consumer Electronics, Energy, Hardware, Manufacturing, Natural Resources, Sustainability",,,1-10,1,,,,,,USD,,Cleantech Open,1,1,,Private,,,,,,
