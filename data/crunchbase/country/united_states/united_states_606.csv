This unique approach is built on proprietary technology, which allows BehaviorMatrix℠ to delve deeper in the data mines of human perception and emotion, to deliver actionable data that a brand or company needs to be successful. Being able to find the emotional drivers and track them over time gives BehaviorMatrix the most comprehensive information in the field of behavioral analytics.  Traditional analytics and business performance measures focus on behavior – measuring what people have already done. These systems give brands exceptional visibility into consumer actions like purchasing, voting, endorsements and complaints, but very little insight into the motivation behind those actions. Emotions, on the other hand, are a precursor for behavior. By measuring them, you can predict what people will do in the future. By understanding the emotional drivers behind behavior, brands can proactively work to change those perceptions in their favor. Until now, measurement of consumer emotion has largely been based on surveys and focus groups. These slow, time-consuming methods attempt to extrapolate the entire population from just a small sample. BehaviorMatrix℠ turns this model on its head, using the entire Internet as a source of “emotional signals”. Unlike other “social listening” and “sentiment analysis” tools, BehaviorMatrix℠ measures much more than just positive and negative sentiment. This new platform measures and analyzes more than 100 different human emotions, from the simple (love, hate, joy), to the sophisticated (trust, apathy, amazement). BehaviorMatrix℠ has been developing the patent-pending technology behind this platform since 2008. This technology pulls in tens of millions of unstructured data points from a diverse set of sources, going far beyond the standard social outlets of Facebook and Twitter. This massive trove of data undergoes advanced linguistic and cognitive behavioral analysis to identify and quantify emotional signals, from nuanced feelings to polarizing outbursts. The result is a true quantitative analysis of something that has previously been considered purely qualitative. Brands get numeric measurements of emotion, along with the ability to analyze the magnitude and directionality of change in the numbers. This gives them the power to incorporate emotional data into their strategic processes. BehaviorMatrix offers three unique products based on its technology: Emotional Indexes℠ – A data feed that extracts and quantifies an individual emotional factor (such as “Joy”, “Trust”, “Fear”, etc.) as it relates to a brand and its competitors. Emotional Indexes are updated daily, allowing a brand to monitor consumer perceptions on a near-real-time basis. EmScape℠ Reports – A customized, high-level analysis of the entire emotional landscape surrounding a brand or product. EmScape℠ Reports also benchmark the brand against an average of the competition. EmPower℠ Reports – A comprehensive, highly detailed analysis of the emotional and competitive landscape surrounding a brand or product. These reports provide a segmented analysis of emotional signals, including demographics of opinion leaders (both promoters and detractors), and a complete comparative analysis of competitive brands and products.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Software",1,William Thompson,11-50,1,,,,,1700000,USD,1700000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

We have an innovative solution that flips the script on the usual question “what makes people leave?”, and instead asks “what makes people stay?”.  We’ve built a platform specifically designed to make it easier for organizations to create a workplace where people want to stay.  With our solution, healthcare organizations are better able to:  * know your people, and build strong relationships with them  * Reduce friction/frustration in clinician’s workflow by eliminating wasteful administrative tasks * support your people more effectively in their career development ** All while dramatically reducing the amount of time your clinicians and your administrative team is spending on manual data entry and paper pushing. **  How We Do It:  DoorSpace’s SaaS platform provides an intelligent data management system, enabling clinicians and their employers to collaborate, manage and maintain mission-critical personnel data.  DoorSpace provides a “single source of truth” that is updated in real-time across the organization each time an employee’s data file changes. We provide organizations with the workforce data they need to make data-driven decisions, and we reduce the time high-value talent is spending on low-value administrative tasks.  The immediate value DoorSpace provides our customers is that we clean up a lot of back office ""clutter"", automating the ongoing organization and maintenance of personnel data and documents.  The long term value DoorSpace provides to healthcare leaders is transparency across their workforce with real-time reporting and superior data accuracy, enabling better, faster decisions.  Specific Pain Points We Address:    * Clinicians and administrators wasting valuable time pushing paper and manually moving data from one silo’d system to another;    * Healthcare leaders wait months to get reports on the state of their workforce, delaying the resolution of serious problems until after impacted clinicians have quit;    * Inability to quickly identify clinician’s strengths and weaknesses to ensure strengths are leveraged while bolstering weaknesses with the right training;    * Delays that are weeks and often months long in getting things done - from placing a new clinician to billing insurance companies and every step along the way, back office inefficiencies      are costing organizations time and money they can’t afford to spend;   * Employers need to both ramp up recruiting to keep staff - ratios, and they need to increase investment in retention with limited resources;    * Growing turnover and no insights or clear strategic retention plan beyond paying clinicians more money;   * Growing frustration among clinicians, especially doctors and nurses, which has led to an increase in medical errors, nurse strikes, turnover, and disengagement from patient care work;","Administrative Services, Apps, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Health Care, Professional Services, Science and Engineering, Software",2,"Brian White, Sarah Worthy",1-10,2,Seed,300000,USD,300000,300000,USD,300000,MassChallenge,,1,,Private,,,,,,

It is not entertainment or communication; it simply saves the money everyone pays monthly. Hitbills found an easy way to reduce costs – just scan your bills with smartphone, or simply tap “Yes”, geolocalization and automatic data gathering algorithm will find you better deals.  HITbills conducts auction for commodity suppliers in your area  (electricity, gas, phone, Internet,  TV, bank services and loans refinancing) with one-tap switch if you decide. Why money can be saved ? The secret of business is that due to global deregulation, there are plenty of cheaper providers (or cheaper banks), offering exactly the same product with lower margin. We talk about really big money (according to Forbes’s list of Top 1000 companies by revenue, commodity sector is  the top – because everybody pays bills – Google ranks at #63, Facebook at #101). Average savings per household are 10-40% (depending on localization) – multiply it by 12, and imagine that you got 1000$ for extra holidays – it is what HITbills does.  And there are 500+ millions households qualifying for reducing bills. Why money can be earned ? Moreover, HITbills gets commission for every switch – the money companies usually pay to their agents or for media advertising – and passes it to smartphone owner (holding %). So customer has double benefit – cheaper utilites + cashback.  And, if you want to get some extra money, you can scan bills of your friends, neighbors, family– everyone saves, you earn. Millions of people use the homebills price comparison websites, but the process is too complicated for 60% of households.  HITbills makes it simple - just scan bills with smartphone. How does it works ? Technically:  the scanned bill goes through OCR , where anonymous usage data are being extracted:  then supplier bid for the bill in real-time reverse auction: finally, the user gets savings . It consists of smartphone app + OCR system + comparison engine + affiliate network. All elements are popular, so this invention can be quickly launched to any market. Where it works ? Hitbills started in Poland; it looks for VC, price comparers, entrepreneurs and partners worldwide, especially in Europe and USA, where the deregulation of energy market is forced by law. The technology and business method is patented in Europe and USA.  HITbills offers master license per country, promotion and shares for local-market partners.","Financial Services, Other, Payments, Professional Services, Software",2,"Pawel Slowiakowski, Tomasz Danis",11-50,3,Early Stage Venture,3634366,USD,3634366,3634366,USD,3634366,"MCI Capital SA, National Capital Fund, Pawel Slowiakowski",1,3,,Private,,,,,,
