Our customers consist mainly of cooperatives and independently owned grocery stores which value working with an employee-owned, environmentally conscious company that manufactures its own products.   Tierra Farm started as a diversified organic vegetable farm in the Finger Lakes region of New York. The organic nuts and dried fruit portion of the business started in 1999 as a way to generate income in the slower winter months. That portion of the business continued to thrive into what it has become today, and we still maintain our original farm. One of our core values has been to cultivate strong relationships with the best organic farmers in the world. Every year, we purchase an increasing amount of our nuts, seeds, and dried fruit directly from the farms, some of which we have worked with for over a decade. Our level of knowledge and communication with our farmers allows us to preserve our organic integrity and ensure fair business practices throughout the supply chain. We offer our customers exceptional value through unbeatable quality at prices that are fair both to the consumer and to the farmer. Our products are made without added oils or refined sugars in our peanut-free facility. We manufacture the products we sell. We dry roast and flavor nuts and seeds, blend trail mixes, grind butter, cover nuts, and fruits in chocolate, and roast fair-trade coffee. Everything is made in small, hand-crafted batches for freshness. All products are gluten-free, peanut-free, and kosher. Our chocolate and coffee are certified fair trade. Tierra Farm handles only certified-organic products which are grown without synthetic pesticides, genetically modified organisms, or chemical fertilizers. This sustains biodiversity, conserves fresh water, and enhances the soil. We generate over 70% of our electricity from solar panels and recycle over 60% of our waste. Our boxes are made from recycled cardboard and our deli cup containers are made from over 50% recycled material—both are recyclable after use. We’re continuously looking for better ways to protect the planet. Our company is also committed to the community. We know there’s a whole big world outside our doors and we want to help make it as beautiful as we can. That’s why we embrace opportunities to support local charities and help them continue to do great work and serve others. Tierra Farm makes more than 60 donations annually, both financially and in terms of our time. Recently selected one of America’s Fastest-Growing Private Companies by Inc. 5000, we remain committed to our team members. Every single Tierra Farm employee makes a living wage of at $15 per hour and enjoys a comprehensive health benefits program, as well as a retirement plan and onsite lunch.","Food and Beverage, Manufacturing",1,Gunther Fishgold,101-250,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
