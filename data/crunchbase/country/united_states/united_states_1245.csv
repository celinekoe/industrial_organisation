Allen cash registers, adding machines, and typewriters can still be found across the country today. At the onset of World War II, the need for a large quantity of aircraft propelled R.C. Allen Business Machines into the aviation world. R.C. Allen had the facilities to manufacture the delicate instruments needed for the war effort. Thousands of R.C. Allen Turn and Bank instruments were installed on war-bound aircraft to help win the war for the Allied Forces. After the war, R.C. Allen continued as a major government contractor, and manufactured instruments for the Korean War. Thousands of Rate Gyro Transmitters were made for military jets during this period. During peacetime, the company developed sub-miniature gyros for Saturn rockets, and at one time, twenty of the special gyros were in orbit at the same time. By 1972, R.C. Allen was the largest manufacturer of aircraft instruments for general aviation in the world. In 1977, R.C. Allen Business Machines Inc. was sold off and the instrument division was Kelly Mfgmoved to the AIR CAPITAL OF THE WORLD, Wichita, Kansas. Under new ownership, it became the R.C. Allen Division of Aircraft Instrument and Development (AID). The Kelly Manufacturing Company purchased the company in 1996, becoming the new manufacturer of the R.C. Allen line of flight instruments.  Today, the R.C. Allen brand still retains its position as aviation’s most trusted line of aircraft instruments worldwide. KMC manufactures a wide range of quality instruments for a variety of military and general aviation aircraft.

Asher Enterprises,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/asher-enterprises,"Enterprise Software, Financial Services","Tennessee, Illinois, United States",Asher Enterprises provides private investment capital for small businesses and convertible loans for companies.,"1,344,819","Great Lakes, Midwestern US",,Active,2000-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,,"Curt Kramer founded Asher Enterprises to provide funding to small businesses who either decide not to work with traditional banks or who were denied by traditional banks. The company provides loans to start-ups out of its own assets. In exchange for these loans, we issue convertible promissory notes.  Convertible promissory notes help small businesses manage their cash-flow. Instead of repaying the loan in cash, our company has the right to convert the amount owed to equity in the company. If a small business succeeds, this is a positive situation for all parties.  Curt's Bio Before he started Asher Enterprises, Curt was a successful private investor. He started the company as a way to help other entrepreneurs and go-getters like himself. With his market know-how and skill, Curt has shown that he has what it takes to lead Asher Enterprises into the future. As he is the only shareholder in the company, his decisions are final. Born and raised on Long Island, Curt decided that Great Neck, NY was the ideal place to establish offices for Asher Enterprises. A man committed to both family and community, Curt married his high school girlfriend. Together, they are raising a family of three children. Curt is an employee's boss. An avid reader, he's always ready to share the latest inspiring book with his staff. He's also there to provide a listening ear to employees and to help them advance in their career. Employees rest assured that they can turn to Curt with any concerns. What We Do An avid investor, Curt is able to see the potential for many small businesses, which is why Asher Enterprises is so willing to invest. A community cannot thrive if there is no growth, and that growth comes from new businesses. However, that is not the way the traditional banking industry works. With traditional banking, you have to prove your creditworthiness before you get a loan. With a new start-up business, proving past creditworthiness is nearly impossible, unless you want to risk your own assets. But Asher Enterprises does not rely on credit histories or scores to deliver funding. The ability to make a final decision on a loan comes to down to Curt, not a numerical score. Asher Enterprises is not alone in its desire to lend to small business. Recently, the House of Representatives passed the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, which promotes loans for new companies.","Financial Services, Software",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

You may have heard the saying, ""sitting is the new smoking"". The modern lifestyle really does lead us to over-sit. Driving to and from work, sitting in your office chair all day, then coming home and sitting in front of the television_ sound familiar? In this way, many of our muscles go unused while others are over-stretched, causing your posture to slip and body aches and pains to begin.  The Unimed Massager is the ideal TENS unit to counteract this problem; it is lightweight and easily portable, and has a large LCD screen for easy selection of the type and strength of massage you need. Additionally, a rechargeable lithium ion battery, together with our extensive range of compatible accessories, makes the Unimed massager ideal for hours of safe relaxation. Simply attach the electrodes to your pain points as described in the instruction manual, and lay back to relax!  The Unimed Massager arrives in a functional storage box with additional accessories including electrode pads, electrode cables, a battery charger, a USB cable, and an instructional manual.

An event stream consists of photo/videos/text notes. They can share this event stream with only those they invite including those that can't attend the event. Unlike other event based apps, Eventnode focuses on the social nature of events, (i.e., sharing of photos/videos/notes in a story format) than the invitation process. This can be seen in the very nature of the app design. Privacy is another key aspect of the eventnode app. For example: unlike most event management apps, we require all our users to sign up. We believe that restricting the list of people that can view an event to an invitee list will enable users to share the moments that they wouldn’t feel comfortable sharing on a public platform like Facebook.","Events, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Mobile, Sales and Marketing",2,"Chandra Kilaru, Geetika Katragadda",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
