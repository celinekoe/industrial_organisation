Take a proven commodity – everyone’s favorite “light” meal, the bagel – and then take it one step further. Offer the original New York bagel, and create a cornerstone for a bagel franchise … without the typical franchise bagel taste. Then structure the business for ease of investment and operation, and “spread the wealth” with other motivated self-starters … like you, perhaps? Joe points out that NY Bagel Cafe’ & Deli is “an easy, workable system that’s simple to learn and train for. And because the bagels are delivered to the store par-baked, preparing the bagels is, pardon the expression – a piece of cake!” As a NY Bagel Cafe & Deli franchisee, you’ll receive complete training and counsel every step of the way. Everything from recommendations with site selection and lease negotiations to help with staff selection and marketing development is built into your support. Taste a Great Bagel and Taste Success!  According to recent studies, the percentage of food dollars spent away from home is 44 percent, expected to grow to 50 percent by 2010. Plus, since 1995, U.S. bagel sales have increased 500% – thanks to Americans’ desires for convenience, taste, and lower-fat alternatives to typical franchise bagel taste. NY Bagel Cafe’ & Deli invites you to take a bite out of this growth. You’ll find that NY Bagel Cafe & Deli runs rings around other bagel shops with a delicious array of complementary foods. Like popular Boar’s Head deli meats, the smoothest flavored creamed and quality hard cheeses; succulent smoked salmon and richly brewed gourmet coffees. And how about super-sized heroes, popular wrap sandwiches, freshly prepared salads, baked fresh muffins and tantalizing cookies? Combine any or all of these items, and NY Bagel Cafe’ & Deli can bring you a brisk catering business: business meetings, breakfasts, luncheons and parties of all kind. Just Sample the Menu! Plain, Sesame, Poppy, Garlic, Onion, Whole Wheat, Salt, Cinnamon Raisin, Pumpernickel, Egg, French Toast, Blueberry, Everything, “Energy” Bagels and Bialys Plain, Fat Free, Scallion, Vegetable, Jalapeno, Olive Pimiento, Fat Free Vegetable, Walnut Raisin, Lox Spread Fresh Sliced Nova Lox Breakfast Items of a Bagel – Eggs, Sausage, Bacon, Ham and Chees Cappucino & Espresso Freshly Ground Gourmet Coffees and Six Specialty Flavored Coffees Deli Sliced Meats and Cheeses on Bagel, Roll or Hero Egg, Tuna, Chicken, and Whitefish Salads Catering Platters – Continental Breakfasts, Sandwich Buffets, Meat Salad and Wrap Platters Eat In or Take Out … with Phone Ahead Open 7 Days a Week for Everyone’s Convenience Where We’ve Been and Where Were Going The history of bagels dates back over 300 years. Why not make some history of your own – with America’s premier bagel … and a premier bagel franchising concept. Presently, there are 30 NY Bagel Cafe & Deli shops, and 50 more under development. And the concept is primed for development anywhere people love a great bagel. How about your hometown? Why is NY Bagel Cafe & Deli the Top Bagel Franchise? No other bagel can compare to our original New York bagel. Simplicity: We have an easy to run operation with minimal space needs. Support: We have proven systems in place to assist all of our franchisees 24/7. Control: We teach our owners to use our detailed control & inventory methods.
