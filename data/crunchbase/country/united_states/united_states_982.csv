Our niche is to provide industrial distribution companies a marketplace to liquidate their slow moving and obsolete inventory. All other auction and overstock sites are focused on consumers rather than on the industrial and business to business market. Our industry surveys indicated that most all distributors have a problem with dead and slow moving inventory. (see http://distributionteam.com/ for detail research).  None of the survey participants had a successful process to liquidate excess inventory.  Based on the above and my own experience as President of Amerisource Industrial Supply, I created internet sites www.deadstocknet.com and www.deadstocknetwork.com to market dead and slow moving industrial supplies.   The first site is a blog site designed to optimize search engine rankings based on Google keywords.  The second site is the commercial site where customers can register, list items for sale and close product sales. We have over 160 users on the site and over 2000 products listed.  New users and activity have remained constant at 225 visist per month and over a 1,000 page views. After the initial sign up of 3 janitorial maintenance buying groups growth has stagnated.  A comprehensive national marketing program must be conducted to increase awareness to the site for it to reach critical mass.  When a critical mass has been reached the site will grow on its own.  Revenue will be earned from commissions on sales, Google Ads and comarketing with Amazon and other commercial sites. Investment funds are required to fund the development and execution of an effective national marketing campaign.","Commerce and Shopping, Transportation",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
