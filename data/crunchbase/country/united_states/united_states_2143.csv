With its 350 hotels in its portfolio, divided in two lines: Avantgarde Line and Epoque Classic, it is rapidly establishing itself as the leading reference in the segment of boutique hotels. Headquartered in Miami, the Company has also sales offices in Italy, UK and France. Established in 2002 by David Maranzana and Juan Palmada, Epoque Hotels has grown and renovated itself thanks to the partners' extensive experience in sales and marketing, property management, international representation, and technology in the hotel industry. A major breakthrough in the company's profile was the creation in 2004 of a brand dedicated exclusively to the most hip boutique hotels of the collection, Avantgarde Hotels. Owing to the ever-increasing number of affiliates, the Avantgarde Line has recently earned a separate brochure as well as a website of its own, both of which were launched during the London World Travel Market in the Fall of 2006.   Indeed, Epoque Hotels has never failed to showcase its chic properties at the leading tradeshows of the industry. Other than at the prestigious WTM, the company featured its stand at EIBTM in Barcelona, and at the 5th edition of ILTM (International Luxury Travel Market) in Cannes, while gearing up to attend the major rendezvous of 2007.","Community and Lifestyle, Travel and Tourism",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
