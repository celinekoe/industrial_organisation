The U.S. Military needed an extremely strong, lightweight, rugged, and survivable fiber optic cable, able to efficiently transmit previously unprecedented volumes of data in the field.   OCC and its engineers were at the forefront of the development of the tight-buffered, tight-bound cable technology that met these criteria. The result: cables that were easy to deploy and performed under the harshest of conditions. OCC's success in the battlefield provided a foundation for the creation of a broad fiber optic cable offering built on the evolution of our technologies, as well as opportunities to expand our product offerings beyond fiber optic cabling. OCC has evolved into a world-class provider of a complete line of fiber optic and copper cabling and connectivity products to a broad customer base. While our heritage started with military, our expertise now extends in to the enterprise, broadcast, industrial,  harsh environment, and various specialty markets, and reaches worldwide through our network of distributors with customers in more than 70 countries. The acquisition of two industry leaders enables OCC to easily transition from a leading provider of fiber optic cables to a company offering a complete integrated suite of cabling and connectivity solutions. Located just outside of Asheville, our North Carolina facility manufactures products using innovative and patented technologies, offering our customers a full range of fiber optic and copper data communication connectivity products. OCC engineers at this facility actively develop products not only to enhance connectivity and networking, but also to establish test and measurement standards for the entire communications industry. Our Dallas, Texas facility provides OCC with innovative expertise and the capability to manufacture specialty fiber optic connectors and connectivity solutions of military and harsh environment applications. OCC's groundbreaking innovations in hardened connectors have become the standard for field tactical military communications, stadium broadcasts, and critical mining applications. By expanding our capabilities and product offerings, we have strategically positioned OCC to support our customers' need for increasingly sophisticated communications infrastructure and end-to-end cabling and connectivity solutions.  Before being acquired by OCC, each new facility was a world-class technology leader in its own right. Now, together as Optical Cable Corporation, we have become a total cabling and connectivity solutions provider for our customers.","Hardware, Sales and Marketing",2,"Bob Thompson, Robert Kopstein",251-500,,IPO,,,,,,,,,,2,Public,2003-01-10,,,OCC,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/optical-cable-ipo--5d0024bf,NASDAQ
