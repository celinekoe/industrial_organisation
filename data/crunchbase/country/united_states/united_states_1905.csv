Children as young as 4-years-old have commissioned their own $25 made-to-order Monster designs. No sewing or crafting skills are necessary. As a customer interactively selects the color and shape of their toy's body and features, the visual representation of their design is instantly updated in the online designer.  Customers clearly see how their customized design will look before they commit to a purchase.  Founded in January 2008 by mom entrepreneur Stephanie Estrin, CurlyQ Cuties was originally an Etsy.com shop selling ready-made monsters.  After repeated requests for customized variations of her Monsters, Stephanie recognized an opportunity to provide a customer-designed made-to-order plush toy at an affordable price.  In July 2008, Stephanie launched CurlyQCuties.com. Today, CurlyQ Cuties offers several plush toy styles from Fairy-Teeth tooth fairy pillows and plush Splatopus to larger and more elaborate Monsters and Moggins.  CurlyQ Cuties even offers a 2-1/2 foot tall Custom Monster!  All products are handmade-to-order in Texas and ship in 10 days or less.

The 401(k) and retirement plan industry has truly failed business owners and employees alike.  So called ""advisors"" leave employers holding the bag when it comes to liability and plan reviews.  They have failed the employees by not providing sound, fiduciary advice. Enter My (k) Advisor.  We provide two core services.  The first is for the business that sponsors the retirement plan.  Instead of simply selling you a packaged product plan and leaving you to your own devices, we work FOR you on an ongoing basis.  We help to manage your fiduciary risks and make the best possible plan available to your employees. Secondly we offer a high quality, web based retirement plan advisory service.  How many questions does your HR department get about your 401(k)?  Our guess is too many.  Instead of asking your HR department, they ask us. While ""participant advisory services"" are made available to all of our corporate clients, we also make these available to the general public.  Our proprietary algorithms gauge your level of risk tolerance, goals, and expected risk/return.  Then they construct the most effective portfolio for you based upon the funds available within your plan. But it doesn't stop there.  We become your accountability partner.  By monitoring your portfolio on a daily basis, we will notify you when we feel any changes should be made.
