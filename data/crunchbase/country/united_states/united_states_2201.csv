For me, it's not just about search rankings; it's about results (your bottom line), your reputation, and your relationships.  The Internet has changed everything for local businesses. How? Your customers and prospects now use it for just about everything. Check out these facts:  - 97% of all consumers now use the Internet when researching products or  services in their local area. - 55% of all local searches are done with intent to buy. - Eight out of ten consumers who research online call or visit a store—and 60% of  those consumers end up buying. The first step for most local businesses is to get out there and get found. But how do you know which online locations are the most important? We would like to give you information on how you can help your business answer this question—a free white paper and a video you can watch right now (it's only 5 minutes long). It shows you the most important locations, how you can get into them quickly, and how you can use them to build your business's online reputation, AND your bottom-line.","Advertising, Information Technology, Internet Services, Other, Professional Services, Sales and Marketing",1,Troy Glancy,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
