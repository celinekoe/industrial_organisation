Our mission is to give impoverished children in India a chance for a brighter future. Clean water, regular medical care, a secure food supply, and access to education-gifts like these can revolutionize a child’s life. Food, shelter, healthcare, and education can mean all the difference between life and death. Far too many children in developing nations and inner cities do not have that bowl of warm food, that textbook, or that supply of medication that we take for granted. Children’s Hope is a small attempt to level the playing field for these children. All of CH’s projects are developed in conjunction with reputed nongovernmental organizations in India. Children’s Hope takes a hands-on approach; the organization does not simply move the money and move on. The impact of CH-funded programs is closely monitored. We also believe every one can make a difference – a few dollars go a long way in India to make an everlasting impact on a child’s life. Unlike many other organizations, Children’s Hope is a 100 percent volunteer-based organization-with no salaries, expense accounts or other fixed or overhead costs-hence all the funds raised go directly toward programs. Children’s Hope raises funds through corporate sponsorships, individual donations, fundraising galas, and cultural events. All board members of the organization are volunteers who travel to India at their own expense to personally research and monitor the projects funded. Donors can be assured that every dollar they donate does indeed reach its destination.","Community and Lifestyle, Education, Health Care, Other, Social Impact",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
