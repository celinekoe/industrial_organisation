Recognition and achievement. Nick Panebianco has been helping people as a workers’ compensation lawyer for over 25 years. Over the course of his career, he has turned a lot of heads and won some incredible awards for his clients, attaining recognition across the state as a knowledgeable and accomplished lawyer. The firm itself is also well known for fighting aggressively for our clients and representing them in a trustworthy manner that always has their best interests at heart. In Florida workers’ compensation law, the name Panebianco means quality. Focus. Many lawyers dabble in workers’ compensation and SSDI law. Nick Panebianco is not one of those lawyers. Not only has he dedicated his entire legal career to protecting the rights of injured workers, his firm is focused almost entirely on those two areas of law. The singular attention that he gives to these types of cases means that every case is handled with comprehensiveness and diligence, giving you the best possible chance at receiving the settlement amount you need and deserve. Personal attention. It is sad to admit this, but in many large firms that handle workers’ comp and SSDI cases, you are not a person – you are a case file. At Panebianco Workers’ Compensation Law, we make sure that this does not happen. Our firm prides itself on being both personable and reachable, and we make every effort to be available when you need us. Just as importantly, we strive to educate our clients on the process, their options, and what they should expect. If you have questions – any questions – we do our best to answer them and keep you in the loop regarding the specifics of your case. Ultimately, we serve you. End-to-end service. As we mentioned above, most people think of workers’ compensation and SSDI as a safety net. If you suffer a catastrophic injury – at work or otherwise – one of those two things will be there to “catch” you. Think about a literal net though. What does it have a lot of? Holes. Holes that you can fall through if you are not extremely careful. In terms of workers’ compensation and SSDI, those holes take the form of the process itself. Though it may seem easy and simple, actually getting the compensation that you deserve is anything but. We make that process easier by handling it for you every step of the way. That means filing your workers’ compensation claim (the petition) or your claim for total disability. Helping you get physical therapy. Arranging transportation to your doctors. Filing a petition to get your checks restarted. Representing you through the entire litigation process. Working to get not just your emergency room bills paid, but all of the costs of your medical care.","Health Care, Professional Services",1,Nick Panebianco,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Caretas PVC,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/caretas-pvc,Medical Device,"Mexico, Maine, United States","Caretas Protectoras, Mascarillas , Tababocas y cubrebocas.","3,066,186","East Coast, New England, Northeastern US",,Active,2012-01-01,day,,,,,For Profit,https://caretaspvc.com/,"Caretas protectoras de PVC Y PET Caretas protectoras: un artículo esencial para la protección de la familia El COVID-19 es un virus que al día de hoy, alrededor del mundo, ha cobrado más de 177 mil vidas. Por tal motivo, el uso de caretas protectoras y cubrebocas se ha convertido en la forma principal de prevención de contagio a nivel internacional. Y es que, a pesar de que el COVID-19 ha mostrado ser un virus de impacto distinto al de la Influenza H1N1 (debido que afecta de manera letal a rangos mucho más determinados de edad), la prevención mediante el uso de caretas protectoras y cubrebocas debe ir mucho más allá de la consideración de su letalidad. “El problema del COVID-19 no es el número de personas en riesgo de muerte como lo fue en el caso de la Influenza H1N1. El problema de la propagación del COVID-19 es que, a mayores contagios por falta de caretas protectoras y cubrebocas, habrá menores posibilidades de que el sistema de salud nacional pueda atender debidamente a todos los pacientes. Es decir, el problema de no usar caretas protectoras y cubrebocas no es que el tratamiento se vuelva más complejo, sino que, si la tasa de contagios se sale de control, no se podrá dar atención a todos los infectados y se agravará su situación poniéndolos en riesgo fatal, sin importar su edad o sexo”, aseguró un doctor del Centro Médico Nacional 20 de Noviembre de la Ciudad de México. Por esta razón, el uso de cubrebocas, así como de caretas protectoras de diversos estilos, características, y durabilidad, se ha vuelto el mayor método de prevención, así como también una responsabilidad social y ambiental. Hoy el uso de caretas protectoras y cubrebocas es necesario para evitar que personas asintomáticas, pero infectadas, contagien a gente con sistemas inmunológicos deficientes, con enfermedades tratables pero sin cura, con problemas pulmonares, con malestares crónicos propios de su edad, etcétera. Una de las cosas que tomó a los mexicanos más tiempo comprender al principio de esta pandemia fue que el contagio puede ocurrir de una persona asintomática a una persona en zona de riesgo. Esto significa que un portador o portadora con una salud medianamente buena, puede infectar a una persona con deficiencias de la misma sin si quiera saberlo. Esto porque, al gozar de una buena salud, no presentará los símbolos que hoy por hoy se conoce evidencian la presencia de COVID-19 en un cuerpo, afirmó en conferencia el secretario de Salud, Hugo López-Gatell. La información antes mencionada ha sido presentada múltiples veces en las últimas semanas durante las conferencias mañaneras del presidente de México, Andrés Manuel López Obrador; quien también ha exhortado a la población mexicana a usar caretas protectoras y cubrebocas al salir de su casa rumbo a sus labores (si estás están tipificadas como esenciales) o al supermercado. Por otro lado, la jefa de Gobierno de la Ciudad de México, Claudia Seinbaum Pardo, fue de las primeras servidoras del país en sumarse a los esfuerzos de prevención de propagación del virus, al indicar que su gobierno invitaba a cines, teatros, plazas comerciales, así como demás centros recreativos; que generan concentraciones innecesarias de gente; a cerrar sus puertas u ofrecer servicios a domicilio para tratar de frenar la propagación de este mal en la metrópolis mexicana. Asimismo, el uso de caretas protectoras y cubrebocas en la Ciudad de México, ha cobrado aún mayor relevancia en los últimos días, porque la mandataria declaró obligatorio su uso dentro de las instalaciones del metro, el tren ligero, así como de los metrobúses de la capital. Cabe mencionar que el metro de la CDMX abre sus puertas diariamente a 1 millón, 647 mil usuarios, razón por la cual la demanda por obtener caretas protectoras y cubrebocas se ha disparado a cifras históricas. “La mayoría de los ciudadanos con trabajos considerados como “esenciales” utilizan alguno o los tres servicios de transporte públicos principales de la ciudad, por lo menos, dos veces al día”, reveló un experto. Por tal motivo, la generación, compra, venta y distribución de caretas protectoras y cubrebocas es más relevante que nunca. Se tiene que entender que, durante esta fase, su uso puede ser la diferencia entre contagiarse, propogar o mitigar el problema y restablecer la vida cotidiana lo antes posible. Debido a ello, la propulción de empresas que diversifican, facilitan y resuelven el problema de abasto de caretas protectoras y cubrebocas de manera local o nacional, se ha convertido en un movimiento vital. Afortunadamente, se está viendo la diaria promoción de empresas dispuestas a convertir a ciudadanos de a pie en distribuidores de caretas protectoras y cubrebocas de PVC. Esta situación no solamente resuelve el problema de provisión que existe debido a la solicitud, sino que también incentiva la creación de empleos e ingresos para personas que viven de actividades que actualmente no se encuentran en operación, así como de aquellas que han sido terminadas de sus labores definitivamente a razón de insustentabilidad de nómina. Entre las empresas que han despuntado en estos tiempos por su eficiencia, calidad y precios en la venta de caretas protectoras y cubrebocas se encuentra Caretas PVC, misma que ofrece ventas en línea y vía telefónica (también whatsapp) a toda aquella persona o negocio que busque hacerse de este tan esencial producto de previsión. Bajo una visión que engloba todas las consideraciones que hay que tener en estos díficiles tiempos, Caretas PVC, se ha distinguido por explicar a sus potenciales compradores de caretas protectoras y cubrebocas, tanto los beneficios de trabajar con ellos, como la preponderancia de sumarse a la causa para acabar con este mal en el menor tiempo y con los menores estragos posibles. Caretas PVC es una de las pocas empresas que han enfocado sus esfuerzos primariamente en apoyar a las personas que en estos momentos requieren de ingresos adicionales. Dispuestos a darles las mejores opciones de pago, y los mejores costos en caretas protectoras y cubrebocas a todos aquellos que quieran crear su propia red de distribución, para ayudar a los más necesitados, Caretas PVC se destaca también por ofrecer envíos a domicilio, así como la garantía de que sus caretas protectoras y cubrebocas han sido aprobadas por la COFEPRIS. Las caretas protectoras y cubrebocas son requeridas al mayoreo en hospitales, restaurantes, entidades de gobierno, supermercados, tiendas de conveniencia, y entre amigos y familiares, por lo que es magnífico que compañías como Caretas PVC hayan decidido enfocar sus esfuerzos en este modelo de ayuda. Cabe resaltar que Caretas PVC es una productora de materiales médicos que desde hace 15 años se ha dado a la tarea de desarrollar caretas protectoras y cubrebocas que ofrecen calidad y perdurabilidad; en esta crisis sanitaria su nombre a resonado con mayor fuerza, ya que buscan poner su granito de arena, para evitar que más familias mexicanas se vean perjudicadas. Datos importantes 1) La fase 3 de la pandemia es la que más requiere de caretas protectoras y cubrebocas De acuerdo con datos ofrecidos por la Organización Mundial de la Salud, durante la tercera fase de la propagación del COVID-19, las tasas de contagio llegarán a su punto máximo, porque las infecciones comunitarias asintomáticas se elevarán de manera silenciosa. De igual manera, su control y tratamiento estarán en sus índices más críticos. Por esta razón, la prevención, a través del uso de caretas protectoras y cubrebocas en esta etapa será, junto con el lavado de manos y el constante desinfectado de espacios y artículos, la única manera de evitar que el COVID-19 entre en los hogares de aquellos que han estado en movimiento y de aquellos que no.",Health Care,1,luis Fenton,251-500,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
