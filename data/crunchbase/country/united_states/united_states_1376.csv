Well in the fabled mists of the local quilt world, the first Granary quilt shop began in San Juan Bautista, California, about 40 years ago, and the owner was from a ranching family, and had a granary.....Fast forward about four decades and several owners, and we have The Granary Quilt Shop of today.  After 17+ years under the care of the prior owner, as of December 2017 the shop is under the care of new owner, Audrey Vallen. The Granary has a wide array of fabulous fabric to appeal to a range of quilters and sewists, whether you find yourself on the traditional or modern end of the spectrum. The shop is filled to the brim with Batiks, grunge, nostalgic 1930s, 19th century repros, novelties, and modern designers from FreeSpirit and Art Gallery.  We also have an extensive color wall to find the perfect supporting fabrics to go with that special fabric that makes your heart go pitter pat!  Allow our experienced staff to help you with your design choices, if you like. We are happy to talk quilting, and recommend a class or project, if you are new to this hobby (ahem -obsession!) Discover patterns, books galore, quilting tools and notions. We have lots of samples displayed to inspire you.  We also carry Valdani pearl cotton and wool, and English paper piecing supplies, for those who enjoy hand work.

LMI-Vet is positioned to enter the stable, growing, multi-billion dollar veterinary market with a new, break-through critical care product, which satisfies a major market gap for companion animals. Like human medicine, the need for a non-toxic Fluid Replacement for dehydration and severe bleeding is considered the holy grail for emergency medicine. Previously, Oxyglobin®, a bovine hemoglobin product, confirmed the need for a veterinary blood substitute, which product is no longer available in the US. Currently, US veterinarians must resort to blood products to satisfy their fluid replacement needs, which have limited shelf life, supply issues, cross-matching requirements, and other market factors, which maintain a need for Dexsome 510 which enhances tissue oxygenation, electrolyte balance,and supplies nutrients. Certain hetastarch products are under scrutiny in the US and banned in Europe, which may create additional demand for dextran based IV solutions. DEXSOME 510 is a new, dextran-based crystalloid, colloid intravenous solution which proposes to become the gold standard for replacement fluids. LMI-Vet Solution will be sold as a replacement fluid, without drug claims, applied to the product. The current competition is threefold, being existing replacement fluids, blood products (whole blood, packed red cells), and Oxyglobin®, which has a controlled  reintroduction in Europe, with a pending re-introduction into the US market by 2015. The key differentiators for LMI-Vet Solution will be easier handling, universal use, reduced cost, and superior safety profile. The differentiating features of LMI-Vet will be established using emerging marketing tactics.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Customers Design's these parts and look for a CNC Machine Shop to make these parts reality. Using the latest technology called CNC Swiss Machines, u can produce these parts at a fixed or fluctuating cycle time. Manufactures that produce these goods are selling services at a fixed quote, but who shall ever make it the fastest and cheapest will buy out its competition . ""However"" being that most Machine Shops have started utilizing the Competitive Swiss machines they have invested most of their work on older and outdated technology like CNC Lathes or CNC Mills. CNC Swiss has taken 80% of the work form these machines thus reaping the rewards of Revenue that generates from every part made,because its a HOT entity in Minnesota, But there are huge problems with this Market Trend for Manufactures  because the lack of Understanding, Programmers, Cost of Machines, Uncertainty  and Most Shops has invested there equipment on older technology so they aren't willing to re-invest in the new market of Swiss. What I can bring to this Market is The ability to Produce revenue in these machines up two 187,000 annually per shift per machine. So six machines is about $1,1,27.000.00 [million] Annually per shift . Another great feature these machines offer is the ability to run a shift without employees,.....That alone generates another Million dollar revenue without overhead cost , so that's money back in the pocket as far as employee cost, because of the technology in the machine which is the reason why the machines are roughly between $130,000 - 187,000.   So Six machines operating two shifts is a estimated 2,254,000.00 minus operation cost and employee cost total. These machines are capable of producing capital over 1000 % of the cost of the machine.
