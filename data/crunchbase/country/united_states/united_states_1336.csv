Recognizing the need for a better way to comprehend vast amounts of dynamic financial information, they surveyed the concepts of visualization found in engineering and medical disciplines. Their solution, Real Time Analytical Heatmaps, was conceived at the Financial Analysis and Securities Trading (FAST) lab, a trading floor learning and software development center at the Carnegie Mellon Graduate School of Industrial Administration. FAST lab consortium members, in addition to NeoVision, include Mellon Bank, J.P. Morgan, and Merrill Lynch, as well as technology vendors Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems, IBM, and Reuters America. With encouragement and technical support from Reuters, NeoVision went into full-scale Heatmap development. The market welcomed NeoVision's visualization technology, which provides benefits similar to sophisticated and complex virtual reality systems at a fraction of the cost. By mid-1996 NeoVision dominated the trading desk environment and has placed Heatmaps in premier investment banks, mutual funds, and brokerage houses. In August 1996, NeoVision moved headquarters from Pittsburgh to Manhattan's financial district to better serve the customer base, which includes over a dozen major financial institutions.","Data and Analytics, Design, Financial Services, Information Technology, Lending and Investments, Other, Software",1,Cormac Kinney,11-50,1,M&A,7000000,USD,7000000,7000000,USD,7000000,"Intel Capital, Bear Stearns, DB Capital Ventures, Gateway Venture Partners",1,4,,Private,,,,,,
