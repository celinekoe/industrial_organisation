RentChimp understands the frustrations that come with finding a home or apartment for rent. They created an application that not only organizes listings, but also allows the user to collaborate with their Twitter and Facebook networks for immediate feedback, advice, and communication with friends and roommates. Users login to RentChimp using their Facebook account. The handy Bookmarklet allows users to easily capture their listings without copy and paste. RentChimp currently uses the Craigslist database for apartment and rental home searches with plans to expand to include all of the major rental listing sources. Users can currently save their favorite New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Florida, and LA apartments. RentChimp has aggressive plans to expand to cover all of the major metropolitan areas. To further simplify the search, RentChimp sends users timesaving notifications when listings change or expire. The user also has the option to write private notes about their listings or manually edit the listing. In addition, users can find their listings on a map and use yelp integration or google places of interest to search for nearby businesses. The feature that truly sets RentChimp apart is its social networking integration. When a user needs to know what a friend or roommate thinks about listings, the user can send out a link to their listings page through Facebook or Twitter. Friends will be able to view the listings and rankings in order to provide feedback to the user directly on the listing page. What makes RentChimp a powerful and successful tool is its identity as a real estate brokerage harnessing technology to empower the consumer, not a technology company trying to do real estate.","Apps, Real Estate, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

For nearly two decades, I have utilized an aggressive and compassionate approach to protect the rights of each client and to look out for their best interests. Unlike most Salt Lake City divorce attorneys, I am one of the few female lawyers to run my own law firm. The majority of divorce lawyers simply provide legal representation. I can do so much more. Not only do I focus on protecting the rights and interests of each client during a case, I also place a high priority on preparing clients for life after a divorce. Most importantly, you do not have to be wealthy to receive the best possible legal representation. You get the whole package at my law firm at reasonable, doable rates. Like many of my clients, I have also experienced the emotional pain, stress and financial hardships that comes with a divorce. I understand your perspective. I am fully prepared to provide comprehensive legal representation to help you achieve the best results. It is critical to have a Salt Lake City family law attorney on your side. There are no winners when it comes to divorce. But there certainly are losers. I have often heard Utah judges and commissioners say that they know they have ruled right in a case when both parties leave the courtroom unhappy. Choosing the right attorney can often make the difference between protecting your rights to parent-time with your children, your rights to your assets or losing much of what you have rightfully earned. My passion for family law began with my divorce. During that time, I experienced the impact a poorly-equipped divorce attorney can have on a person’s life. From that point, I became determined to help others avoid the pitfalls I had experienced. I have become deeply rooted in the Salt Lake City community and support a variety of causes both locally and internationally. I have also represented clients throughout Utah, including Provo, Orem, American Fork, Lehi, Layton, Roy, Clearfield, Ogden, Logan, Vernal, Roosevelt, Duchesne, Tooele, Draper, Sandy and Park City. What makes me different from other Salt Lake City family law attorneys is my passion and drive. It is an approach that I apply to all my cases. I am a self-made woman who believes in the value of hard work and helping others achieve success. When I am not practicing family law, I spend time outdoors, enjoying motor sports and living life at more than 100 miles per hour. Fear is not a part of my DNA. When selecting a Salt Lake City divorce lawyer, it is important to have representation from a lawyer that will use the best strategies, and maximum effort to put each client in the best possible position to succeed in mediation, in settlement, or in the courtroom, and in their future.",Professional Services,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

We started to ask questions: Why is it that only a small % of salespeople are able to develop mutual trust and respect with customers? Why do only the very few get other people to open up to them? Why do only a few reach the high level of connection that fosters collaboration, the reciprocal sharing of ideas and beliefs that can move people to change and why haven’t we, in the sales training industry, been pursuing these questions more aggressively? It’s ironic: somewhere along the line, a profession whose prevailing model that is based on questions, stopped asking questions about itself. So we did it. We began challenging our own beliefs, starting with, “Is there a better way?” This led to more and more questions, a domino effect, and soon we found our- selves in fields of study that had been previously off limits to us—fields that explored the mysteries of communication that we’d written off as unteachable because they fell out- side the purview of our models and industry research. We had been training salespeople for a combined 40 years and we thought we had all the answers. For most of that time, our definition of selling has been some variation of “helping people solve problems.” The definition was based on the belief that the decision to “buy” is like problem solving, logical and rational. For our Solution Selling and CustomerCentric Selling methodologies, we taught salespeople to ask buyers a series of logic-oriented questions designed to lead the buyer to conclude the seller’s product was the logical, right answer. As it turns out, a lot of our basic assumptions were wrong. People are not logical and rational when making the decision to buy. Furthermore, asking buyers questions—at least the kinds of questions we were training salespeople to ask— is not an effective means of connection or persuasion. In fact, the way we conditioned salespeople to ask questions has proven to be often counterproductive. We missed the mark: we wildly misinterpreted what the most influential salespeople were actually doing. They weren’t just asking buyers questions; they were establishing emotional connections. They were inspiring other people to follow their beliefs. They were influencing people to change minds. They were doing things that weren’t being taught in sales training classes, and they weren’t doing the things we were teaching. This is an especially hard pill for us to swallow, because we’re the ones who created the solution selling training paradigms. What we soon learned was that we should have been looking for answers outside the sales productivity industry all along. People in other disciplines already understood a lot more about sales and influence than the sales training industry did. We’ve come out the other end of this journey with a profoundly new understanding of sales effectiveness: how people get other people to change minds. And we’re sharing this understanding in our Storyleaders™ workshops. These are for sales professionals and for anyone else—executives, politicians, teachers, attorneys, consultants, and so on—whose work involves influencing others, whether one is “selling” products, services, ideas, advice, or beliefs. By demystifying what great salespeople do, we believe we ourselves have learned to better influence change, develop deeper relationships with our customers, and find greater meaning in selling.","Data and Analytics, Design, Sales and Marketing",1,Michael Bosworth,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
