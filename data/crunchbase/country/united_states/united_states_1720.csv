This unique and patented technology will be used as a platform upon which treatments for several types of cancer, including advanced, inoperable pancreatic cancer, and diabetes are being built.  PharmaCyte Biotech’s treatment for pancreatic cancer involves low doses of the well-known anticancer prodrug ifosfamide, together with encapsulated live cells, which convert ifosfamide into its active or “cancer-killing” form.  These capsules are placed as close to the cancerous tumor as possible to enable the delivery of the highest levels of the cancer-killing drug at the source of the cancer. This “targeted chemotherapy” has proven remarkably effective in past clinical trials.  In addition, PharmaCyte Biotech is working towards improving the quality of life for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer and on treatments for other types of solid cancerous tumors. PharmaCyte Biotech is also developing treatments for cancer based upon chemical constituents of marijuana known as cannabinoids.  In doing so, PharmaCyte Biotech is examining ways to exploit the benefits of Cell-in-a-Box® technology in optimizing the anticancer effectiveness of cannabinoids, while minimizing or outright eliminating the debilitating side effects usually associated with cancer treatments.

These take under 5 minutes to post, and have zero obligation. In addition to the immediate benefits, companies can identify and evaluate job candidates, including those from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds, and authentically assess job skills, cultural fit, and non-cognitive traits (e.g. grit, communication, teamwork, etc.). For college students and recent grads, Parker Dewey provides the opportunity to demonstrate their skills and grit, explore careers, develop their networks, and generate income as they seek internships and full-time roles. Furthermore, these authentic, experiential learning opportunities complement in-class instruction, thereby improving academic performance and driving completion. As a result, career launchers graduate more job-ready, and have the perspective and experience to find a full-time role with the right skill and cultural fit. Using data from these projects, Parker Dewey also provides insights to college and university faculty so that they can better align curriculum with job skills demanded by companies. In addition, these academic institutions can more effectively engage alumni and professors as mentors, counsel students on career options, and support existing and / or prospective corporate recruiters. Parker Dewey made it really easy for everyone to use the platform. It takes under five minutes to post a project (including setting the price and due date), career launchers apply only to those assignments that interest them, and companies select who they think is the best fit.

Climate change and environmental degradation are the largest existential threats to humanity in the 21st century, and also the largest economic opportunity of our time. These problems are fundamentally issues of economic coordination. Regen Network, a Techstars-backed company, is a digital platform powered by Cosmos SDK that allows farmers, brands, and institutions to make auditable ecological agreements so that we can rapidly accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture and reverse global climate change. Regen Network is comprised of two important parts. We are building a Proof-of-Stake blockchain focused on ecological data, assets, and agreements using the Tendermint Consensus Engine and the Cosmos SDK. Join us to help secure what we believe will be the most important distributed ledger on Earth — the ledger of ecological health and agreements. In addition to creating the underlying infrastructure necessary for ecological accounting, we’re also building real-world applications. Investing in Regen Network Now is the time to take bold action to reverse the degradation of this planet. This technology offers us an incredible opportunity to do just that. We are currently in a private pre-sale for our native staking token or offering convertible notes for equity if that is what you prefer. We will personally guide you through the investment process to make it as easy, private, and secure as possible. Token Mechanics Regen Ledger is secured through our staking token, the Regen token (XRN). XRN follows the Cosmos Proof-of-Stake consensus and token economics. By purchasing and staking XRN, you help secure this essential infrastructure and the public good it generates, plus staked tokens receive network fees and block rewards as compensation for this important work. For more detailed information please see our economics paper. Regen Network Development, Inc. is building a contracting platform utilizing Regen Ledger to make easy and accessible ecological contracts between institutions and land managers, who may not have the capacity to interact directly with the blockchain. At the center of these agreements are scientifically-robust ecological protocols that verify a change in practice or outcomes on the ground.
