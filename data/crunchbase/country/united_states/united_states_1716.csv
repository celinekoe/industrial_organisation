The Spinal Stiffness Gauge (SSG) was patented and developed to allow an accurate, objective, intra-operative, computer-based measurement of spine joint instability before and after spinal decompression. The SSG was used at the University of Miami in over 300 patients undergoing spine surgery to demonstrate the accuracy and value of the measurement, which may become the needed, essential definition of spinal instability used to guide and document the necessity for fusion, restabilization or just the decompression. A database of SSG measurements has been developed from the test results in 300 patients, and can be reviewed in the May 2002 issue of SPINE.","Health Care, Manufacturing",1,David C.
