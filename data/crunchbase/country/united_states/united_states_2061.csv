The organization was named after former Black Panther, Fred Hampton, and also cites inspiration from Italian Marxist theorist, Antonio Gramsci, as well as educator and philosopher, Paulo Freire. In order to remain consistent with its working-class billing, the HI seeks out, as well as aims to develop, organic intellectuals within the working class; both in the US as well as internationally. The Hampton Institute has roots almost a decade old. During his time in graduate school, HI founder, Colin Jenkins, became intensely politicized and ""obsessed"" with reading, learning and acquiring knowledge. During this time, he developed aspirations of writing. Eventually, this personal aspiration evolved into a desire to create a collective outlet for radical inquiry. As with such ambitions, this embryo was constantly overridden by the demands of life. Then, years later, he was ready to give it a go. The energy, and opening created by the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement was the final push Colin needed. The fruit of his energy and initiative is the HI. According to its founder, The original team was gathered through roughly three years of networking, mostly on social media. It allowed me to meet a diverse group of intelligent, inquisitive and passionate folks - the very folks who are now the Hampton Institute. Although the ranks of the HI's leadership have seen some changes since its initial inception, there has remained a dedicated and diverse group of scholars, activists, radicals, and other heterodox thinkers at the core of the HI.",Community and Lifestyle,,,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

In its early days, FIT operated as a grassroots group working together for neighborhood disaster resilience. Now a non-profit, FIT volunteers from across the globe deploy to disasters and work on disaster risk reduction and resiliency efforts. Past work in disasters includes hurricane Sandy in 2012, the 2013 Moore, OK tornadoes, the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, Philippines typhoon Haiyan in 2013, and the 2014 mudslide in Oso, WA. FIT has also worked with refugee children from Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras in the USA as result of the unaccompanied migrant minor crisis. In 2012, FIT’s projects include collaboration with FEMA to redesign its Disaster Recovery Centers and development of the concept that later became FEMA’s Disaster Survivor Assistance Program. In 2013, FIT worked with the Drupal Conference to create housing and ride-sharing apps for stranded survivors of the 2013 Moore, OK tornadoes. After Typhoon Haiyan devastated the Philippines in November, 2013, FIT sent a crew to set up a heat map demonstrating internet connectivity. In 2014, FIT’s disaster response engagements included working in the Oso, WA with collaborators to develop computer-generated 3D interactive reconstructive models and 3D prints of the Oso mudslide. These outputs increased situational awareness of impassable terrain and helped keep first responders safe. In Oso and following the Pilger, NE twin tornadoes, FIT worked with Splunk4Good to develop and pilot the Donations Tracking Dashboard app for county officials and volunteer coordinators aiding the response. In support of the US and Mexico border crisis response, FIT worked with designers, artists, and thespians to develop a recreational activities curriculum designed to build community within refugee and disaster-displaced populations. In 2014, highlights of FIT’s work on disaster resilience and preparedness building included the Washington Community Innovation Summit with the Washington Governor’s Office, Futurecasting earthquakes with Intel Inc.’s Brian David Johnson, Autodesk, the California Lieutenant Governors Office, and the California Office of Emergency Services. FIT supported and helped facilitate the third Canada-U.S. Enhanced Resiliency Experiment (CAUSE III) aimed at demonstrating how new technologies can enable Canadian and U.S. emergency responders to exchange situational awareness information as an incident unfolds. FIT also ran two disaster innovator Bootcamps to train its next generation of volunteers for disaster activation and to prototype solutions to anticipated problems brought on by crises.",Sales and Marketing,,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

All members work together to improve transportation options of people with disabilities.  NMEDA was originally formed as an association of mobility equipment dealers in the state of Florida. In 1989 membership opened on a national level and the National Mobility Equipment Dealers Association was established. The organization promotes and supports individual members engaged in the modification of quality transportation for people with disabilities. Membership has grown to more than 600 members with the bulk of the membership located in the United States and Canada. All members are required to adhere to the safety standards of Transport Canada and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and to follow the guidelines set by NMEDA. Every member agrees to follow these guidelines when they join the association. The guidelines, which are actually a living document providing detailed recommended practices on equipment installation and modifications, are updated yearly.  The Quality Assurance Program (QAP) is a recognized accreditation program for the mobility equipment industry. The program was developed to promote quality, safety, and reliability within the industry. Some states now require a dealer’s participation in the QAP to perform work for the Vocational Rehabilitation Programs. The QAP is the only program of this nature developed for the mobility equipment industry. A QAP designation enhances vehicle modification and mobility equipment installation in a manner consistent with the highest guidelines available in the industry. Use our dealer locator to find QAP certified dealers of Wheelchair Accessible Vehicles and Adaptive Equipment!  NMEDA is striving to unify and improve the mobility equipment industry and service to people with disabilities.

The generic view is the front page, which presents the most important news for the day from all the sources we monitor, ranked by our algorithm. The personalized view is based on a recommendation engine that tracks user's reading habits and personalizes the content stream to each user's detected preferences. The recommendation engine continuously adapts itself to the changing user reading habits so that the recommendations are always relevant. Finally, Euraeka offers a few unique features not found on other sites of the same industry. As part of the ranking process, the engine automatically detects the political bias (liberal, conservative) of articles on that topic, as well the propaganda level (deception intention) of the text regardless of its topic. The goal is to provide a system that not only can recommend content that is most interesting to each user, but also warn of potential harmful articles and attempts of disinformation.","Content and Publishing, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Sales and Marketing",1,Georgi Dinkov,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
