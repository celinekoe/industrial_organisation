Its founders work hard, and that hard work is translated into the beer that they brew. Although the road to the Brewery opening had some detours, this Lincoln, Nebraska Brewery has proudly been producing beers since December 2011. Brian Podwinski, Blue Blood Brewing Company President and Co-Founder, began his first career as a Police Officer with the Lincoln Police Department in 2000. Unfortunately his policing career was cut short due to an injury which forced him to retire from the department in 2006. His sidelined career created extra time and the search for a new passion, so Brian began brewing beer at home. Immediately after brewing his first batch from a kit, he was hooked. Brian researched and studied the art of brewing beer and experimented with different ales, ingredients, and formulas. Taking notice of Brianâs spectacular beers, Jason Goodwin began brewing with him. The thought of opening a brewery seemed like an unobtainable goal, but it seemed to become more reachable the more the two brewed (and in turn drank). Another year of research and planning ultimately reaped the ultimate reward. Blue Blood Brewing Company came to fruition after hours of preparing prefect recipes, finding a wonderful location, and setting up well-researched equipment. This Brewery was created with the help and support of family, friends, and several helpful and creative contractors. Many fans ask where âBlue Bloodâ came from. Brian and Jasonâs law enforcement backgrounds are the heart and soul of this company. They have a strong desire to honor those who protect and serve every day. Each different beer style produced will be named with a significant number which offers a special meaningâmany of which are fashioned by great influences from the past and present. These numbers will help the brewers create each beer to match up perfectly with those people and places which have been an inspiration. Blue Blood Brewing Company makes beer with conviction, passion, and reason. The namesake comes first and then is used to create the best beer possible to ensure the heart and soul of Blue Blood Brewing Company is in every batch! Blue Blood Brewing Company is proud to use only the finest ingredients from around the country, including fantastic hops grown right here in Nebraska by Rhynalds Hop Growers in Prague. While ingredients from Europe and other reaches of the globe could be used, these brewers believe the perfect ingredients for their beer can be sourced right here at home!!!",Food and Beverage,1,Brian Podwinski,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
