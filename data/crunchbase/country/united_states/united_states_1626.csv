Teach For Us was developed during Adam Gellerâ€™s time at the Teach For America training institute and publicly launched July 23, 2006. The concept stemmed from the idea that if Geller had the inclination to blog about his experience, it was likely that others did, too. It was Geller's belief that the collective voice of a community could resonate louder than blogging alone, however there was no existing site or mechanism for this to happen. Sometime in between lesson planning and copy-room runs, the site was born. In 2008, Teach For America began publicly recognizing Teach For Us as a source of finding out â€œwhat itâ€™s truly like to be a Teach For America corps memberâ€ by placing a link on its [The corps experience](http://teachforamerica.org/corps/index.htm) page.

As former seasoned executives, we now help companies maximize their resources and take advantage of financial opportunities so that they can become – and remain – strong competitors in today’s highly charged business environment. Understanding that each of our clients has unique needs and expectations, we offer a highly customized approach to achieving financial efficiency, cash flow, strategic growth, and long-term stability. Our Outsourced Accounting Mission Transforming the way people view value related to outsourced accounting and finance. How are we different? Real Time Data Our services provide our clients with real time data so that they can make information-based decisions in real time.  We provide you with reporting packages and key performance indicators (KPI’s) that can help you make decisions that truly drive your business forward. Results Based Pricing This approach is no different than buying a nice dinner at your favorite restaurant.  When you order your meal, you know what you’re getting and how much it will cost before you make the purchase.  Could you imagine going to your favorite restaurant and paying for dinner based on how long it took them to prepare and serve your meal?  A traditional accounting firm does just that.  They prepare a bill based on how long it takes the accountant to perform the task.  We don’t think this is fair to you.  Hourly billing does not promote an emphasis on customer service or an incentive to complete jobs timely. Monthly Fees You pay a monthly fee only for the services you want and need. The fee does not change based on the number of phone calls or conversations that you have with our Staff. Technology to Add Value So many CPA firms are stuck in the past, utilizing outdated technology and services that provide very little value to their clients. They focus primarily on historical financial statements and tax returns.  At RTA Group, we utilize the latest technology to ensure that we are providing our clients with value.  Imagine if you knew how your performance stacked up against your competitors and others in your industry.  RTA Group can show you. Not a local company?  That’s ok, our firm was built to operate virtually and currently services clients throughout the United States.  The technology that we use, and our effective communication methods allow us to provide you valuable services as if we were right next door. Our Advantage … Your Success! We’ve spent our entire careers transforming finance and accounting functions into a competitive advantage. Our team has practical hands on experience at all levels across many different organizations and industries just like yours. We’ve been where you are, so we know the information you need and how to get it. When our clients come to us they are hungry for the real time data and cost savings that an efficient finance & accounting department can provide, and we provide just that. We’re ready to do the same for you!",Financial Services,1,Mark Denning,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
