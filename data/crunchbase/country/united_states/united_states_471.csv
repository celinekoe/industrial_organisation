That's true, of course, but there's something else it can do, too - it can help people maintain links to their own country as they travel, study or work abroad, or even after they've emigrated. PolishForums.com is an online resource for foreign people and Poles wherever they are, and also welcomes anyone who's planning to travel to Poland or is interested in learning the language. Basic membership is free and gives access to all the facilities of the forum, although premium memberships are also available. As the name suggests, the heart of Polish Forums are the forums themselves. On the home page you'll find a category button with an impressive list of forum categories to choose from. Everything is covered, from news and current affairs  through sub forums for Poles living in other regions to food and drink and even guides on how to celebrate holidays in Poland. If you're looking for basic language lessons or free translations you'll find sections to help you out. There are also some extremely useful resources - more sub forums give members opportunities to search for or offer jobs and housing, find pen-pals or arrange events. PolishForums has been running since 2005, so almost everything relating to Poland has been discussed at some time. The site provides a searchable archive to help you track down exactly what you're looking for. If you can't find it, all you have to do is create a new thread and ask; the members are extremely helpful and somebody will be along with an answer soon! There's a lively community, too, so something interesting is always going on. If you enjoy your free membership and want to gain some extra benefits you can sign up for a gold membership. You can choose your own annual fee, and in return you get to view the forum without any ads, a larger inbox and the ability to see who's online. For higher fees you can add a custom signature and even a free lifetime VIP membership to a related site about Polish Women. If you're Polish and want to keep in touch, or if you have an interest in Poland, PolishForums.com is exactly what you're looking for.","Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Real Estate, Travel and Tourism",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Registered users can use our service as a meeting place and exchange PC video cards with each other. Listed PC Video Cards will often carry a lower price compared to the same card offered through a regular online hardware store. In many cases the savings will be substantial.  Here is how the process works: * Sellers place the video card classifieds in a predefined category that corresponds to type of the graphics hardware they want to sell. * Buyers browse for available VGA cards and buy them directly from sellers. * Sellers and buyers negotiate payment and shipping directly with each other using our web service as a meeting place.  Finally, at the end of the transaction both sellers and buyers can exchange feedback and end the transaction.  VGATrader.com is a free service. We do not charge any kind of listing fees. Instead we rely on non intrusive Google's text ads service — adsense and PayPal donations for the revenue. The overall experience that we are aiming for is a combination of the EBay:registered: like interface + free Craigslist:registered: elements + some of the formalized aspects of forums trading. We are trying to blend all 3 of those into a single package and hopefully not only appeal to the community of PC hardware enthusiasts, but also to new people that are confused about the available choices of video cards.","Commerce and Shopping, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Mobile, Video",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Golden Avatar Environmental Technology LLC Our product, {R.I.O.S.S.T.} Rapid Intervention Oil Spill Suppression Technology can clean up some of the most insidious environmental hazards known to humankind.  It turns crude oil into protein/enzymes while disintegrating the molecular bonds of the oil, in essence changing it back to its natural state, which is essentially fish food.  It is designed to clean-up oil spills, while at the same time protecting the environment in a safe and cost effective manner.  Unlike toxic, expensive dispersants, our totally environmentally friendly Mitigation Product transforms oil into harmless protein and is effective on land, sea and river water environments. The method of application is economically superior to conventional systems and is safer as well as faster acting in fighting pollutants with non-toxic's and represents a clear paradigm shift in the way we will go about cleaning up the planet. It offers a significant opportunity for liability mitigation to large oil companies.  In our contract services agreements we anticipate charging oil producers a substantially lower rate for Clean-up mitigation services rendered. All oil industry companies (and their shareholders), related insurance companies supporting the oil industry, governments, or environmentally concerned groups having anything to do with oil production or its transport over water are going to want this product and mitigation service in their arsenal of support products. For this small planet, our technology represents a seminal shift in the manner in which we prepare for our collective response to oil spill catastrophes in the future.","Agriculture and Farming, Manufacturing, Professional Services",1,Erich Hauser,1-10,1,,,,,100000,USD,100000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Cloud computing power is now fundamental to any business, science, government, military affairs, and social activities – we cannot live without it – and it will be traded beyond the border as a commodity. Therefore, the meta-data generated by Baransu’s intelligent marketplace (i.e. the worldwide flow/price/ demand/supply/etc. of the computing power) can indicate the movement of the world, and the quickest knowledge about it will bring an invaluable advantage to the company who owns the marketplace. As well as providing substantial competition among users, providers and operators of the cloud in the future.  Furthermore, with the commoditization of cloud computing services this will raise a wide range of businesses and activities around the marketplace. Baransu can either partner with for mutual benefit, acquire or start as we see fit. It may include an insurance company who covers a failure of the service providers, a credit rating agency who evaluates the reliability and reputations of the providers, and an independent agency like the Securities and Exchange Commission who enforces fair trading on all the participants in the marketplace.
