We focus not on teaching today’s “best practices,” or presenting a one-off, check-the-compliance-box workshop, but on training leaders to understand what an inclusive culture looks and feels like, why it matters, and how to design one, whether they are the CEO or manage a team of two. We teach leaders how inclusion impacts everything from recruitment, hiring, promotion, and retention to customer service, creativity, and effective meetings. And we help leaders develop a diversity and inclusion skill-set that can serve them, their teams, and their organizations throughout their careers.

Did you know that millions of people around the world have made the token economy part of their everyday life? These under and un-banked people are eager to work, and accept payments in cryptocurrency through the CoinClaim platform.  Through its partners, CoinClaim serves this global workforce, and the individuals and brands looking to hire them. CoinClaim was launched in 2018 to provide a turnkey, fraud-free, single point of entry platform for individuals, brands and the world’s under and un-banked communities.  Our technology allows distribution of payments for services to recipients on a mass scale, with lower fees. CoinClaim is not a whitepaper. It is a proven, working platform serving hundreds of thousands of users worldwide. CoinClaim has not raised money through an ICO or IEO.  CoinClaim is a cryptocurrency technology platform that was built to solve three problems related to dispersing micropayments to individuals around the world.  ·        Payers new to cryptocurrency are subject to a fragmented and confusing technology experience when seeking to make crypto payments. CoinClaim removes the barriers to entry for those wishing to send micropayments. Our one-to-many system allows for input of any currency (including fiat), and output in cryptocurrency to an unlimited number of recipients. ·        Making payments to billions of under-banked and unbanked people around the world presents many risks. Sending fiat currency presents risk for theft or mismanagement of funds by those who distribute to the final recipient. Cryptocurrency is recorded in an open ledger, eliminating the potential for fraud. Crypto also allows direct delivery to an unlimited number of intended payees without middle-men or handling fees/charges. The intended recipient receives exactly the amount sent, without risk of fraud or middlemen “taking a cut” for their services. ·        Making micropayments with fiat currency or Bitcoin currently subjects the payer/payee to fees that are out of proportion to the low amount of the transfer. For example, an employer  may require 100 users to complete a task, paying $0.15 per task. The fees applied to each $0.15 payment would exceed the amount earned. With CoinClaim, $0.15 tasks can be distributed for a fee of 0.13% or less.  The CLM Token is an ERC-20 token created in 2018 and is currently exchangeable on three exchanges. All CoinClaim partners use the CLM utility token for transactions in the system.","Financial Services, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Sales and Marketing",2,"Bogdan Pavel, Jeff Ownby",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
