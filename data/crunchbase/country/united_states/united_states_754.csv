Our mission is to revolutionize the way music is distributed by using the Internet to allow bands to communicate directly with -- and sell music to -- their fans. Unlike some other sites, Riffage.com is staffed by people who genuinely care about music -- musicians, former radio DJs, record company veterans and rabid fans. We think you'll see the difference. On the site, Riffage.com offers a large selection of authorized digital music, both for free as well as for purchase via download from the Internet. The ability to purchase single songs by download -- or even buy an entire physical CD -- from the comfort of a home, office, school or any ""connected"" location, makes Riffage.com an enticing alternative to shopping at a physical retail outlet. One of the biggest obstacles for most Internet music fans is finding music they like. Among the key features differentiating Riffage.com from the growing ranks of online music distributors are its unique personalization tools, which ""learn"" an individual's preferences as he or she uses the site. As a result, Riffage is able to quickly begin sending users recommendations about music that will appeal to them. Riffage.com has also rapidly developed into an active online community where fans of similar -- and even diverse -- musical tastes can meet to discover and discuss independent artists and their music. Musicians will find that Riffage.com offers an impressive roster of services, using the Internet as a direct marketing and distribution channel straight to the consumer. As a result, Riffage is successfully supplanting the traditional music industry paradigm of artist-label-distributor-retailer. Through Riffage.com, artists can deliver their music to fans either via direct downloads or by plugging into Riffage's turnkey e-commerce system for selling physical goods. And thanks to a state-of-the-art, daily updated system for reporting current sales, rankings and customer lists, band members are always just a mouse click away from accessing this important information. To increase awareness and improve communications with their fans, musicians can tap into Riffage.com's site to publish and promote upcoming concert dates, music previews, artist news and band merchandise, as well as use Riffage to help manage fan contact lists. Bands can also host live chats and discussion boards through Riffage.com, and are eligible to participate in company-generated promotional activities and events.","Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio",,,1-10,1,M&A,21000000,USD,21000000,21000000,USD,21000000,"TransCosmos, AOL, Bertelsmann, Mayfield Fund, BMG Music Publishing",,5,,Private,,,,,,

When I started, I had a bad left knee that  hurt constantly, a sciatic nerve issue that at times caused LOTS of pain especially in my left shoulder. The biggest issue was my left lung, which had a sore spot bigger than a silver dollar, and caused major breathing issues for me while I coughed up black stuff and wheezed for air anytime I moved too fast or too long. None of my physical issues exist anymore!!!  I have now completed 26.2 to 30.1 miles without stopping 8 times. I give all the credit  to my dog, Keywee, since I made the decision to get back into shape after our first walk. Here is a 2:23 video with Keywee and my story, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCsmUc0mX6M.  I successfully brought a product to market and wrote a book about the experience.

Community Center for Churches is a web-based church management software tool that helps you easily manage all the data that goes into running a church, like membership and newcomer information, contributions and expenses, and church event details. As a pastor and professional software developer, I created CCC because I saw the need for a tool that not only keeps track of information but also helps me to be a better pastor.  CCC does this by mining specific, up-to-the-minute data from the program and displaying it on your Dashboard for you to act on. It reminds you of membersâ€™ birthdays, shows you budget and expense figures and reveals trends in newcomer attendance. More importantly, through lapsed giver and attendance reports, CCC alerts you to a potential need for pastoral care, or to an adjustment in the way your church approaches newcomers or advertising.  When combined with your intelligence and existing pastoral knowledge, CCC becomes a powerful pastoral tool that allows you to care for your congregation more effectively. Thatâ€™s why we say that Community Center for Churches is â€œData that helps you care.â€",Software,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
