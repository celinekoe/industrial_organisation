Noble Newman,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/noble-newman-llc,Education,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States",Noble Newman is an avid reader and educator. He decided to take his passion into the publishing and entrepreneurship sector.,"1,635,074","Great Lakes, Northeastern US",,Active,,,,,,,For Profit,https://noblenewman.net/,"Noble Newman is an educator and lifetime educational activist with a passion for reading, writing, and literature. In addition, he has a deep-rooted interest in incorporating technology in the classroom, especially for subjects like with science and mathematics. One of the most motivating quotes that inspired Noble to enter the education sector was Albert Einstein's view for teachers. Einstein states that, ""the supreme art of the teacher is to awaken the joy, creative expression, and knowledge within a student."" Because of this, Noble decided to attend Colgate University with a bachelor's in education and philosophy. He continued his studies at University of Illinois with a Master's in Education where he was able to cultivate his understanding of transformational leadership and education pedagogies. This eventually shaped his planning, teaching, and tactics within the classroom. Having worked in education for a number of years, Noble has now shifted gears and is trying his hand at authorship, specifically, children's novels. Much of this comes from his love and passion with fantasy and science-fiction books such as Harry Potter, Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief, Ender's Game, Eragon, Peter and the Starcatchers, and the Ranger's Apprentice. Similar to these classics, Noble hopes to make the same impact that these books have made on millions of children by taking them into an unexplored new world and letting their imagination drive their passion. In addition to writing, Noble is now just getting his feet wet within the tech space by teaming up with his brother in the creation of an app. The tech space is one of the most inspiring and exciting areas of business today, and technology has always been at the forefront of Noble Newman’s mind. The chance to be part of the boom of innovation on our planet right now is something that could motivate anyone. In addition to offering ways to help businesses run more smoothly and efficiently, and creating an environment in which new businesses can flourish, technology offers unprecedented opportunities for self improvement, opportunities that are virtually unlimited, and confined only to the boundaries of the human imagination. As an entrepreneur, Noble Newman is learning more and more about the business, marketing, and branding sector. Outside of creating his applications, Noble is also in charge of developing and implementing a proper marking and communication strategy for his startup. The purpose of this strategy is to determine and support permanent business growth and to ensure brand quality and awareness within the intended markets Noble is trying to hit. This in turn should fulfill his business and professional endeavors of increasing sales, growth, and of course, profitability. In addition, Noble is inclined to do the following: -Planning, organizing, and managing all marketing activities for his product -Establishing, developing, and implementing the company's brand within new and innovative marketing strategies -Developing and implementing new communication ideas, proposals, and strategies -Raising financial capital for product design and development -Creating and developing strategies for promoting and selling of products and services -Participating in conferences, national and international tech fairs, and other marketing related events -Overseeing product and service production -Creating branding, public relations, advertising, and other marketing materials -Making and sustaining presentations, sales training, and product launch -Developing and handling product and marketing annual budget -Creating research based testing for product and services -Meeting and communicating with customer's needs and demands While extremely demanding, Noble is incredibly excited about this new endeavor, not only because of the app itself, but also because of the opportunity to partake in the creation and cultivation of a small business. He is looking forward to this process and will post updates on his entrepreneurial website.",Education,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
