They have a Patent application that is in Office Review and Federal Election Commission approval. The markets they will initially serve are massive and consistent – the Political Donation market will be approximately $10-$12 Billion in 2015 and 2016 and the Non-Profit donations from individuals is approximately $135 Billion per year.    Over the last decade there has been rapid growth in mobile phone usage. “Smart” phone technology has facilitated the rapid growth of texting (SMS) and social media. GTSG is tapping into this growth by developing a secure system to immediately fulfill economic transactions using text. By leveraging bank networks with standard PCI compliance protocols, nothing is stored in the phone as transactions are processed securely. A Process Patent filed in 2012 is under Office Action Review with the US Patent Office, with a final decision expected in 2015. GTSG’s initial market segments include political donations (estimated minimum $10 Billion annual market for 2015 and 2016) and non-profit donations ($220 Billion market annually with $135 Billion coming from individuals.) In 2012 GTSG received approval from the U.S. Federal Election Commission to process contributions on mobile phones via credit and debit card networks, a first to this market.    Key Risk Mitigation Attributes    • Initial product is developed and in use  • GTSG’s vertical markets are massive   • No consumer behavior change required  • Highly experienced management  • Business model simple and achievable   • Major prospects in sales pipeline   • Patent protection in progress    The initial products are built, tested and in use.
