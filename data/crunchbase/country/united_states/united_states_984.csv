The product addresses the longest unsolved safety hazard on the nation’s and world’s roadways; wet night pavement visibility in regions that receive snow.     Painted lane lines become invisible to motorists during night rain. Only reflective raised pavement markers (RPMs) can be adequately seen to provide visual guidance in such conditions. However, anything raised is destroyed by snowplows. The Highway Beacon’s® raised reflector depresses on impact from vehicle tires or snowplows into the pavement then springs back into position.     This revolutionary patented design results in the only fully functional all-climate reflective lane delineation system in the world. The combination of wet/night visibility, durability, snowplow compatibility and ease of maintenance has never before been achieved by any RPM.     The product is manufactured through a network of top tier U.S. suppliers . Gross and net profit margins will be exceptional. Future products will include internally illuminated units for fog and other high hazard locations and airports.    The market for the Highway Beacon® is vast. The product will be marketed worldwide and is patented in Canada and patent pending in the U.S. The U.S. total market is over $9 Billion.    Significant market traction has been achieved. The marker has been approved for installation by multiple agencies.     The company will market the product directly to highway agencies in the U.S. and internationally. However, the primary means of sales will be through well established regional distributors and independent agents/firms who sell highway safety products.    There is no viable competition in snow climates. Previous products all have major performance, durability and maintenance deficiencies. Millions were installed in order to address this prevalent hazard, but are now largely discontinued due to the deficiencies.",Manufacturing,1,Dean Paulos,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
