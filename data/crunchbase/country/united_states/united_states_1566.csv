The company provided services to financial firms, venture backed start-ups and also Fortune 500 organizations. Clients included both public and private sector government agencies, most notably the U.S. Government and Intel Capital Venture backed portfolio companies. Based on D&B records, the company is based Newport Beach, CA and is a private company categorized under Business Management Consultants. D&B records also show it was incorporated in 2005 as a California Limited California Company. Current estimates show this company has annual revenue of $2,500,000 and employs a staff of approximately 18. SynCorp was originally founded in 2002 operating as Synergy Systems and S2 Technologies, a then systems integrator and a systems engineering firm.  Synergy was later incorporated in 2005 as a hybrid Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) and Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) firm with James Mai, a former consultant and entrepreneur as its Managing Director.  The company immediately secured contracts with three major managed healthcare providers, achieving profitability and expanding in its first year of operations.   By the end of 2005, the company finalized contracts to provide management consulting and advisory services for several companies in the Real Estate and the Mortgage Banking industry. The company partnered and developed several market expansions, which resulted in an estimated 900 million dollars in funded residential transactions before the collapse of the housing market in 2008.  In 2008, the company turned its attention to the contingent search practice, working with internet companies and public sector companies including defense contractors.  SynCorp later became a prime vendor to the US Government and was awarded several single source contracts. The Management Consulting division focused on strategy partnerships with internet and venture based partners.  Despite securing new contracts, the company faced heavy losses as the majority of its clients were related to the housing market. It began downsizing in 2009, closing most of its field locations and reducing workforce, the company remained operational until 2011. In 2012, the remaining assets of the company including it's recruitment division were acquired by Bristol & Bates, a holding firm now operated by James Mai.","Financial Services, Internet Services, Professional Services, Real Estate",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
