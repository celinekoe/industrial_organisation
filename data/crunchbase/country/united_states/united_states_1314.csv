The potential market for this device is $16 million per year. The Realens Accommodating IOL  is based on the latest theories of human vision and near focusing. Recent advances in cataract surgery have shown that the ciliary muscle inside the eye continues to contract even as we advance in age. When the brittle cataract is removed in surgery, this artificial lens can be implanted inside the eye and will focus just like the natural, youthful lens.

D’Isernia. As the owner of a fleet of commercial fishing vessels, Mr. D’Isernia ventured into the world of shipbuilding after learning first hand that the only way to get the type of vessels he wanted was to design the vessels, write the specifications, and build them himself. As he built and developed his own personal fleet of vessels, other professionals in the industry took notice and also began desiring their own custom built vessels. Soon customers in areas including New England, the Pacific Northwest, and Alaska were contacting Eastern with requests for customized fishing vessels. By 1980, 26 commercial fishing vessels had been constructed and delivered. Building on his passion for boats and the sea, Mr. D’Isernia decided to diversify Eastern’s reputation from a ‘Fishing Vessel’ shipyard into a shipyard that could fulfill any type of custom vessel request, large or small. In 1981, Eastern’s diversification began with the delivery of their first Offshore Supply Vessels. Today, Eastern’s history includes a portfolio of over 350 vessels and Eastern is one of the most diverse vessel construction companies as a result of its state of the art production line and fabrication process. Eastern has built everything from Offshore Supply Vessels to Tugs, ATB’s, Inland Towboats, a SWATH Vessel, Passenger Vessels, Ro-Ro/Passenger Ferries, Inland Transport Vessels, Barges, Fireboats, Research Vessels, Offshore Construction Vessels, Dredges, High Speed Passenger Vessels, Fishing Vessels, and more.",Transportation,1,Brian D’Isernia,501-1000,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The core of Lagunitas came from Chicago, St Louis, Memphis, Walker Creek, and the highlands of Quincy. The Chicago contingent initiated the brewing and the gravitational effect of its suchness did the rest. They all loved the beer but the mission was larger than the ordinary joy of a hoppy-sweet quaff. It was driven unseen by an urge to communicate with people, to find their diasporidic tribe, and to connect with other souls adrift on a culture that had lost its center and spun its inhabitants to the four winds to wander lost and bereft with a longing to re-enter the light. Beer, they have learned, has always been a good lubricant for social intercourse! The Lagunitas Brewing Co. was not so much an act of ordinary 'foundling' as it was willed into being by the unspoken desire of supportive beer-lovers in Northern California after which they continued to nurture their creation and urged us forward to fulfill the unifying needs of that same beer-loving diaspora from coast to coast and beyond.
