We are currently developing a Project M backed Telemedicine Platform that will be the new norm of the TeleMedicine Paradigm. The embedding of Project M helps doctors better understand the emotional state of their patients in real-time, thus maximizing more accurate diagnoses. Project M uses NVIDIA Clara Guardian to assist in its emotional health facial recognition software. With the help of NVIDIA, Project M is able to provide highly accurate and helpful patient information to healthcare professionals leading to better emotional consciousness.   Our next model is Project M backed e-learning system - using the comprehensive emotional analysis Project M provides (including levels of happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, disgust, neutrality, contempt, and fear along with moods such as positive, negative, and neutral), instructors can accurately gauge whether students are actively paying attention and can take personalised measures to address each students’ needs. With M’s feedback, teachers will thus be able to improve the teaching and learning process more efficiently.    Project M won first place at the Texas Children's Hospital Healthcare Hackathon, one of the top-ranked children’s hospitals in the US and successfully completed the three-month AI Tech Sprint at the Department of Veterans Affairs 2020-2021 where we developed a solution for our heroes - veterans.

The schools of the university include School of Architecture, College of Arts and Sciences, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, School of Law, School of Medicine, McIntire School of Commerce, Darden Graduate School of Business Administration, and School of Nursing. The university offers 51 bachelor's degrees in 47 fields, 84 master's degrees in 67 fields, 6 educational specialist degrees, two first-professional degrees (law and medicine), and 57 doctoral degrees in 55 fields. Affiliated with 7 Nobel laureates, it has produced 5 NASA astronauts, 7 Marshall scholars, 4 Churchill scholars, 29 Truman scholars, and 50 Rhodes scholars. Thomas Jefferson founded the University of Virginia in 1819. He wished the publicly-supported school to have a national character and stature. It is the first non-sectarian university in the United States and the first to use the elective course system. Jefferson considered the founding of the university to be one of his greatest achievements. Undertaking the project toward the end of his life after a long and illustrious career that included serving as a colonial revolutionary, political leader, writer, architect, inventor, and horticulturalist, he was closely involved in the university's design. He planned the curriculum, recruited the first faculty, and designed the Academical Village, a terraced green space surrounded by residential and academic buildings, gardens, and the majestic center-point, the Rotunda. The most recognizable symbol of the university, the Rotunda stands at the north end of the Lawn and is half the height and width of the Pantheon in Rome which was the primary inspiration for the building. The Lawn and the Rotunda have served as models for similar designs of centralized green areas at universities across the United States. The university was opened for classes in 1825 with a faculty of eight and a student body numbering sixty-eight. Jefferson took great pains to recruit the most highly qualified faculty, five of whom were found in England and three in the United States. Instructions were offered in ancient languages, modern languages, mathematics, moral philosophy, natural philosophy, chemistry, law, and medicine. Jefferson opposed the granting of degrees on the grounds that they were ‘artificial embellishments’. In 1824, however, the Board of Visitors authorized granting the Master of Arts degree. The Doctor of Medicine or M.D. was awarded to the first graduates of the School of Medicine in 1828 and the Bachelor of Law degree or LL.B. was first awarded for law school graduates in 1842. The bachelor's degree was awarded beginning in 1849, but became the standard undergraduate degree and a prerequisite for the master's degree in 1899 bringing the university into conformity with other institutions of higher learning. The PhD has been awarded since 1883.","Education, Software",1,Thomas Jefferson,10001+,5,,,,,217075000,USD,217075000,"Virginia Innovation Partnership Corporation, Chris and Carrie Shumway Foundation",2,2,,Private,,,,,,

Rockwell's lead drug candidate in late-stage clinical development is for the treatment of iron deficiency in dialysis patients and is called Soluble Ferric Pyrophosphate (SFP). SFP delivers iron to the bone marrow of dialysis patients in a non-invasive, physiologic manner via dialysate during their regular dialysis treatment. In completed clinical trials to date, SFP has demonstrated that it can safely deliver sufficient iron to the bone marrow. SFP is nearing completion of its Phase 3 clinical studies (CRUISE-1 and CRUISE-2) and is expected to address an estimated $600M U.S. market. Rockwell is preparing to launch its FDA approved generic drug called Calcitriol to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in dialysis patients. Calcitriol active vitamin D injection is indicated in the management of hypocalcemia in patients undergoing chronic renal dialysis. It has been shown to significantly reduce elevated parathyroid hormone levels. Reduction of PTH has been shown to result in an improvement in renal osteodystrophy. Rockwell intends to launch Calcitriol as soon as it receives FDA manufacturing approval, addressing an estimated $350M U.S. market. Rockwell is also an established manufacturer and leader in delivering high-quality hemodialysis concentrates/dialysates to dialysis providers and distributors in the U.S. and abroad. As one of the two major suppliers in the U.S., Rockwell's products are used to maintain human life by removing toxins and replacing critical nutrients in the dialysis patient's bloodstream. Rockwell has three manufacturing and distribution facilities located in the U.S. and its operating infrastructure is a ready-made sales and distribution channel that is able to provide seamless integration into the commercial market for its drug products, Calcitriol and SFP upon FDA market approval. Rockwell's exclusive renal drug therapies support disease management initiatives to improve the quality of life and care of dialysis patients and are intended to deliver safe and effective therapy, while decreasing drug administration costs and improving patient convenience. Rockwell Medical is developing a pipeline of drug therapies, including extensions of SFP for indications outside of hemodialysis.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",1,Robert Chioini,501-1000,5,IPO,80000000,USD,80000000,100000000,USD,100000000,"Hercules Capital, DaVita, Crede CapitalGroup, Antara Capital Master Fund",3,4,1,Public,1998-01-27,,,RMTI,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/rockwell-medical-ipo--c97b6669,NASDAQ
