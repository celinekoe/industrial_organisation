For traditional materials; such as, cans, bottles and newspapers, ecycler provides an alternative to the many U.S. (and Canadian) households, institutions and businesses that are not offered curb-side recycling. Itâ€:tm:s also an option for people who have to pay for curb-side recycling or who want to have their recyclables picked up when and where they desire. For non-traditional materials (tennis balls, wine bottle corks, eyeglasses, et al.) ecycler offers the opportunity to recycle these items that are not usually recyclable via local recycling centers. Two types of recyclers will use the site: the â€œdiscardersâ€ and the â€œcollectors.â€ Discarders will be individuals located at a residence, business or organization who are interested in timely and free removal of recyclables. Collectors, the entrepreneurs, will be individuals, businesses or organizations that are interested creating a network of discarders that will provide them with recyclables that they can redeem for cash. Discarders enter into ecycler.com that they have recyclables available for pickup and the site links them to collectors in their area. After a pickup is arranged, the discarders place their recyclables in the pickup location (curb, end of driveway).  In many cities and towns, there is no municipal curb-side recycling program, therefore making it inconvenient for people to recycle.  Even in cities that do have such programs, there is an incentive for people to use ecycler.com because they can arrange to have their recyclables picked up when itâ€:tm:s convenient for them, rather than on the cityâ€:tm:s schedule. Also, discarders who use ecycler.com help foster entrepreneurship in the community. For the people collecting the recyclables, redeeming the items for cash may either provide supplemental income or be a primary source of income.  Discarders can also make money by choosing not to give away their recyclables for free, but to request a portion of recyclablesâ€:tm: estimated value.  The site also allows discarders to measure how green they are by tracking the amount of recyclables they give away through ecycler.com and on their own.",Sustainability,2,"Craig Robertson, Timothy Laurent",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

""""Miniature Super Air Pump"""" - has the pressure to push air through small 1/8""""-3/8"""" plastic tubes to the hot components. It can replace 6 fans in a typical application. 2.	""""Micro Channel Heat Sinks"""" - The Fin Spacing is 10 Thousandth of an Inch apart. This creates a large surface area in a small space. The Micro Channel Heat Sink is 50 - 100 times smaller than a typical heat sink used today.  3.	Hardware to connect the Super Air Pump to the heat sinks which are tubes, clips, brackets, and manifolds to split the air between multiple tubes.  4. An Automatic version, which includes a Microprocessor Controller Board. Thermistors are mounted on each hot component and each tube will include a Piezoelectric Valve to control the air flow. In this version, the Design Engineer specifies a set temperature and a maximum temperature for each component. The Controller Board adjusts the valves to provide the air required to maintain the set temperature. If the temperature starts to rise, the Controller Board will open the valve for that component and send more air. If still more air is required, the Controller Board will speed up the Air Pump Motor to increase the overall air flow in the system.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Manufacturing",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The company supplies products and custom solutions based on its X-Forge Technology for companies that want to create and deploy advanced 3D games and other rich 3D content on mobile platforms. Fathammer was founded in October 2000 by a group of veterans of the game, telecommunications and mobile technology industries. The members of the management team have previously been involved with ten successful start-up companies. The company's employees are a tight knit team who have extensive backgrounds of working together at previous companies and projects. Additionally, most of the people in the company have their roots deep in the ""demo scene"" computer culture. The demo scene started in the 80s on the early home computers such as Commodore 64 and Amiga. It is here where low-level assembly programming and optimization was taken into a whole new level and seemingly impossible visual effects were created on super-limited hardware. Fathammer's core strengths include the thorough know-how of real-time 3D graphics technologies, optimizing for the limited hardware configurations of mobile devices and the development of high quality games. Combining this with seasoned project management, innovative product development and creative design, Fathammer can satisfy the specific needs of its customers in an effective way. Fathammer's engineering and development operations are based in Helsinki, Finland. Fathammer also has an office in San Jose, California, which coordinates the company's sales and marketing activities. The company is privately owned and currently employs 30+ people.","Design, Gaming",,,1-10,2,,4000000,EUR,4838444,4000000,EUR,4838444,"3i Group, Nexit Ventures",,2,,Private,,,,,,
