BringShare is unique in the fact that it compiles all online marketing initiatives into a single, easy-to-comprehend view (or dashboard) and presents data in a way that makes it simple to identify which efforts provide the best return on investment, which approaches need to be modified, and those initiatives that aren't paying off.  BringShare provides highly intuitive marketing performance metrics in a fraction of the time and related cost than it would take either manually or using other programs and methodologies. This affords anyone who measures marketing initiatives the ability to make better strategic use of their time as well as their marketing dollars. How BringShare works  Simplicity is a key driver of BringShare's platform. Anyone can begin evaluating their online marketing spend and performance metrics with three easy steps: 1.	Connect all of your accounts (Google Analytics, Facebook, Twitter, email marketing, etc.) to your secure BringShare account 2.	View dashboards showing results for each channel as well as a master dashboard showing all channels combined BringShare subscribes to the ""less is more"" theory. The less complicated the tool is, the more effective it becomes for its users.  The benefits of BringShare: A smarter process makes for a smarter marketer  BringShare's time-saving tool gives valuable time back to the marketing team so they can spend more time doing what they were hired to do in the first place. That in itself is smart, but BringShare also takes the guesswork out of determining what works and what doesn't by providing a comprehensive, easy-to-understand picture of marketing, which makes any BringShare user a smarter marketer as they make informed decisions that grow market share. Cost-effective measurement that truly impacts the bottom line BringShare offers affordable, customizable plans that meet the strategic needs of businesses just starting out as well as those leveraging multiple marketing channels. Our mid-range plan (Complete) is less per month than the average cost of one billable hour of a mid-level marketing professional. And while we've all heard that you have to spend money to make money, we think a better proposition is spend less and make more.","Data and Analytics, Internet Services, Sales and Marketing",2,"Danielle Walton, Justin Spring",1-10,5,,2831931,USD,2831931,2831931,USD,2831931,"Rev1 Ventures, NCT Ventures",,2,,Private,,,,,,

We have sold to the biggest department stores in the USA, Ross, Tk max of Europe, Marshalls, DD'S discounts, National Stores. We have also worked with big department stores in Mexico, Brazil , Canada and more. After two years of watching these department stores sell out our clothing and come back for re-orders, this meant something to us. Now we have been working to launch our online site 15shopstop.com so we could be able to sell our clothing direct thats made in the USA, all under one roof to the consumers. Fashionable items that they look for at the most amazing prices possible. We need funding for our online account, so we can hire marketers, more designers, seo specialist, content writers, and more employees to meet the demand of our shipping policies.
