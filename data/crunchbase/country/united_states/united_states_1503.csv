Data on blockchain though is extremely noisy, hard to read and even harder to make sense of them. Openstory was created in order to organize and democratize the access of blockchain data so users can make educated decisions, based on information and knowledge that before was only available to highly technical funds and companies. What’s happening on-chain Openstory is not a siloed API aggregator, a hand-picked catalog, or a centralized recommendation web2 service. Openstory is an indexer that focuses on scanning and unveiling on-chain truth like a story so everyone can easily make decisions based on objective information. What you see in the platform is not a recommendation from an employee or the curated information of APIs; instead, our database starts and ends with indexing the public on-chain information, offering a pure outcome of how people use and interact with web3. How challenging is this? Mapping web3 is both a data intelligence challenge and a UX challenge. How do we display the information meaningfully and drive usage beyond? How deep do we go? Your feedback is essential to its success, so we'd love you to be part of this journey early on. How to use Openstory The initial token/NFT sale can be the beginning of the experience, not the end. A creator or a brand can use Openstory to see how web3 users use/interact with their creations, spot their audience (who is buying and what’s their engagement) and reward them accordingly. A collector can use Openstory to assess if an NFT is worth buying based on usage/investors attracted, discover the up-and-coming collections, meet other collectors/soulmates, and create deeper relationships with the artists they love. A flipper can discover the most recent collections that grow exponentially. Everyone can check key market metrics, e.g., active users in the market, market growth, and marketplaces with the highest traction, so they have a better picture of the market they invest their money and time.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Data and Analytics, Other, Software",4,"Katerina Stroponiati, Kostas Stroponiatis, Vinh Nguyen, Yiannis Varelas",1-10,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
