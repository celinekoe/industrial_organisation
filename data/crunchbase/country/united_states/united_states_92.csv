Solar Titan,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/solar-titan,"Commercial, Energy, Energy Efficiency, Manufacturing, Mining, Renewable Energy, Solar","Redding, California, United States",Patrick Harris worked with 2 solar contractors for over a year and found overhead costs were holding back solar installation.,"2,130,261","West Coast, Western US",,Active,2014-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,http://inventionaires.com/,"Patrick Harris worked with 2 solar contractors for over a year and found overhead costs were holding back solar installation contractors and a major overhead was labor and material costs. This makes  for  “High Overhead” ( Wages,Insurance,Freight for materials, Travel time) time that was charged back to each customer. The installation required so many panels because the maximum output was average of 240 Watts. Large Solar Tracking systems use many panel modules mounted on very strong towers that follow the sun throughout the day. The Solar Titan can reduce the total number of these towers by producing much higher solar power with lower number of panel modules. CASE STUDY: The largest dual-axis tracking system currently operating in the US was commissioned  by Solar Power Partners (SPP). With 89 tower units producing 1 MW at the West County Wastewater District (WCWD) in Mill Valley, Richmond, California, Premier Power was SPP’s EPC contractor on the 5 acre (2 ha) project. ET Solar trackers, measuring approximately 22 by 36 feet each (7 metres by 12 metres), are used at the site and the arrays contain 56 modules with a total peak power of about 11.24 kW each. The system produces approximately 1900 MWh annually, replacing some 35% of WCWD’s electricity usage. SOLUTIONS: If this installation had been done using the Solar Titan, they would have used only 62 tower units with each tower handling only 28 Solar Titan panels instead of the 56 standard panels. Each tower would produce 16.1 kW instead of the 11.24 kW with standard panels. The entire 1 MW system with only 62 tower units and 28 panels per tower unit would require 30 percent less tower units and over 50 percent less panels. The Solar Titan may reduce the number of panels needed in an installation by ½ (Half). Using a High Density of solar cells mounted vertical to angled collector reflectors, the Titan produces a much higher output than standard flat solar panels. That is why the industry needs the Solar Titan.","Energy, Manufacturing, Natural Resources, Other, Sustainability",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Simply stated, they work with you to obtain better results from your existing data and connected enterprise assets. For many organizations, blindly collecting massive amounts of data and storing it in hyperscale databases does not lead to better outcomes. They have found that the solution is to design models and write software programs that, to the extent possible, produce the desired behavior from a small set of instructions rather than a vast table. The result is better conversion rates of data monetization, simpler operations, and faster time to solutions. There are many examples showing that this can be done successfully. For example, the huge tables of square roots used by engineers in the 1970s have now been replaced by a simple five-line program on electronic calculators. The question is, can they leverage AI to do the same to solve their most immediate business and operational problems? They know the answer is yes. Through the application of simple, model-based, goal, utility, and learning agents, they can maximize the expected value of any performance metric.
