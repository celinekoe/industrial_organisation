On May 13, 2015, it changed its name to WhatsCrackin, LLC. The Company provides a proactive solution for nightlife venues that the Company believes can improve their current business operations through the use of the WhatsCrackin Mobile Application (the “App”). The venues which subscribe to their App are referred to “Venue Clients,” and the customers of the venues which use their App are referred to as “Users.”    Their principal product is the App, which enables Users who subscribe to their App to access exclusive deals, happy hour times, hours of operations, directions, and other information for nightlife venues in their areas who are also their Venue Clients. They are also in the process of developing the Geo-Chat (the “Geo-Chat”) technology, for which they plan to file the patent in the fourth quarter of 2016. They believe that the Geo-Chat will enable nightlife venue owners and managers to receive comments and opinions of their customers in real time when their customers are present at their venues.     They have developed a mobile application called the WhatsCrackin App. The App is an innovative tool that, once the Geo-Chat feature is implemented, they believe can provide their Venue Clients real-time comments from their customers.  The App is catered to the needs of Users who seek to frequent nightlife venues in their locality. Whether they are seeking a low-key type of venue or high-end dance club, the App will identify these preferences and give the user real-time information of what is happening in their local area.   Unlike other methods of receiving customer feedback, once the Geo-Chat feature is available, the App will be able to give their Venue Clients real-time feedback of what is happening in their location so that they can either remedy or enhance their customers’ experience based on the feedback received from the App.","Gaming, Media and Entertainment",1,Rich Boysal,,1,,50000,USD,50000,50000,USD,50000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

(Nasdaq: STRA) is an education services holding company that owns Strayer University. The mission of Strayer University is simple: to make higher education achievable for working adults.  Strayer Education believes their value as a business is inherently linked to Strayer University's ability to deliver a high quality academic experience to students. Strayer Education's goal is to sustain and grow their business by offering rigorous and relevant academics that provide real returns to adult students, alumni and their employers.  As an open access institution, Strayer University makes educational attainment logistically simple. Students have the opportunity to take classes on campus, online or a combination of both. Each year, thousands of students who have made the commitment to educational attainment graduate from Strayer University and go on to become leaders in their organizations and communities.  Strayer Education, Inc., traces its roots to the founding of a small business college in 1892. That year, Dr. S. Irving Strayer opened the doors of Strayer's Business College in Baltimore, Md., to provide professional education to working adults.  For more than 123 years, the institution has stayed true to its original mission. In 1969, the school received licensure to grant Bachelor of Science degrees and was renamed Strayer College. Authorization to grant the Master of Science degree followed in 1987.  In 1996, Strayer Education, Inc., was established to raise capital for expansion and take Strayer College public. In 1998, Strayer College was granted university status and became Strayer University. In 2000, Strayer Education, Inc., successfully completed a major recapitalization. This included the introduction of a new senior management team led by Robert S. Silberman, current executive chairman of Strayer Education, Inc. In 2011, Strayer University acquired the Jack Welch Management Institute to offer an Executive MBA online.  Through the years Strayer University has maintained its commitment to academic quality and student success. Today the University takes great pride in its campus based and online degree programs and in the professional success of its alumni.
