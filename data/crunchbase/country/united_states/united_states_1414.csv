Our technology aims to build a more sustainable music industry. We want to put more money into the pockets of songwriters and businesses alike.  Soundstr's primary focus is modernizing the performing rights industry. Performing rights organizations (ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, etc; ""PROs"") collect money for commercial music use. PROs charge businesses general blanket license fees that offer the ability to use all music from a catalog. With some PRO's catalogs containing millions of songs, it is impossible for a business to use all music they are paying for. This is an inefficient and antiquated process. This fee structure is also unlike radio and TV, which only pay for the actual music they use. Soundstr's technology allows businesses to identify all music used and negotiate per-use license fees. Our technology also helps songwriters receive compensation when their music is performed or broadcast in a commercial setting. This same patent-pending technology offers the ability for businesses to generate more advertising revenue. Radio-style ads are broadcast in venues before/after live events and during set changeovers. We also offer beacon technology, which puts advertisers in direct connection with consumers. Our advertising network creates a new revenue stream for songwriters, businesses, and venues. More money flowing into the system creates a more sustainable music industry.

For semiconductor companies and electronic device manufactures with stringent requirements in terms of safety and security, Hex Five’s Trusted Firmware provides secure boot, device attestation, remote firmware updates, telemetry, real-time monitoring, and scalable secure communications. Unlike traditional firmware, which is built as a monolithic blob of trusted and untrusted functionality, Hex Five’s Trusted Firmware is completely self-contained and isolated from the rest of the system thanks to the underlying Hex Five’s patented MultiZone® TEE technology. With Hex Five, companies throughout the semiconductor value chain benefit from stronger security, reduced development costs, times and risks, and the flexibility to safely integrate readily available multi-sourced hardware and software components. PATENTED TECHNOLOGY Securing embedded devices has become increasingly difficult as complex new requirements are often met with the addition of readily available 3 rd party components that cannot always be trusted. Most embedded devices lack the hardware resources to provide the necessary separation, thus leading to larger attack surface and increased system vulnerability. To shield critical functionality from untrusted third-party components, Hex Five has designed, developed, and patented MultiZone® Security, a truly innovative Trusted Execution Environment providing hardware-enforced software-defined separation of multiple functional domains within the same chip. Complexity is the enemy of security. To simplify the development process, and to minimize the risk for human error, MultiZone encapsulates and hides the complexity of managing the underlying hardware security blocks exposing their functionality as a set of policies. The only interaction between the developer and Hex Five’s Trusted Execution Environment is a simple policy definition file. No security expertise is necessary and no coding is required – or in fact even allowed.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Internet Services, Mobile, Privacy and Security, Science and Engineering, Software",2,"Cesare Garlati, Don Barnetson",1-10,1,Seed,770000,USD,770000,770000,USD,770000,OSS Capital L.P.,1,1,,Private,,,,,,

Its USP lies in engineering micro particle surfaces by deposition of fine, cohesive secondary material giving rise to tailored composite particles.    APT technology formulates blends through the adsorption/adherence of fine ""guest"" particles on to the surface of coarse ""host""particles. The production of these new ""functionalised"" particles occurs in an  environmentally friendly manner whereby the powder undergoes fluidisation/aerosolisation through the injection of a gas ""air‐blade"", allowing coating of the guest on to host through particle‐particle interaction, as opposed to the solid‐solid blending occurring in current state of the art technologies. The resulting powders display dispersion and coating of all the fine guest materials on to the host particles. The uniqueness of this particular dry coating technique is the use of no solvent in a relatively isothermal process with the absence of particle attrition during formulation. APT is therefore able to formulate not only unstable drugs but address challenges with industry standard blending methods.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Manufacturing, Science and Engineering",,,1-10,1,Seed,1000000,GBP,1226175,1000000,GBP,1226175,"Aston University, DSW Ventures",1,2,,Private,,,,,,
