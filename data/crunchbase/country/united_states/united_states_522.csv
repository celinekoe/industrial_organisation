We have recognized the need to provide an innovative product that balances beauty, safety, quality, and an unwavering commitment to long-term durability.

WE GET INTO WIND POWER 1995 Learn about using a ghost wind turbine power and DIY wind power generation. A ghost wind turbine means it's made of clear plastic which makes them hard to spot and not such an eye catcher. When it comes to wind turbines invisible is good! They are great to augment the solar panels in the off-grid power system. One thing is for sure the Sun does not shine at night. At the northern latitudes solar panels get covered with snow for most of the winter and days are short and cloudy which just about put an end to solar power for 6 months of the year. The danger here is that the batteries would get run down and freeze, which would ruin them. A ghost wind turbine is a good option and the best bang for the buck. Today's turbines are very silent so do not be concerned that it would be noisy, but the noise at full speed is equivalent to an electric induction motor running, which is okay. It’s cool to look up and see it spinning away generating electricity. Most small ghost wind turbines made of clear blades keep your neighbors very happy. You also need a tower and wiring so figure that into the project.  Most people use a simple length of steel water pipe for the tower. The tower was free and the material and shipping brought the total cost to about $750. This is for the add-on to an existing solar system. If you are starting from scratch, the solar panels, charge controller, batteries and a power inverter for a small system will set you back a minimum of $1,800. That and your free labor is the cost of not having an electric bill in your mailbox every month. You need to a have knowledge of electrical and construction technology together with tools and skills to do it yourself. Raising a 40′ tower requires planning and a bit of overarching self-confidence. A similar system I looked at that was put together by a professional contractor reportedly cost over $15,000. I am on the lookout for more tower sections so I can raise the turbine up another 20 feet to catch more wind. The challenges never stop.",Energy,,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Increasingly strict global regulations, litigation risks, and industry-wide push for cost reduction has created an urgent need for toxicity evaluations of not just the end-products, but also the starting materials.  By screening out toxic drug targets, avoiding the use of toxic raw material, pharma and biochem companies can avoid many months of wasted R&D time, minimize the toxic waste generation, and avoid costly late-stage manufacturing changes. End result: less time and money needed to bring drug to market. For consumer sectors, by minimizing the use of toxic raw materials and formulations, they can minimize the risk of late-stage manufacturing changes, and increase govt. compliance, and brand recognition. What do we offer?: 1)	Toxicity of less than 0.1% of chemicals is known. Scientists rely on material data-sheets, but 80% of these are either inaccurate or incomplete. We offer toxicity evaluation of all chemicals, including new molecules 2)	Companies are having difficulty in keeping track of worldwide frequently changing government regulations and chemical threshold. We provide up-to-date compliance and chemical threshold information 3)	Within consumer industries, suppliers don’t disclose formulation ingredients (their IP), and they cannot accurately predict toxicity of their formulations, because the models that take into account the % composition of chemicals, and their interactions within mixtures don’t exist.  We are building such models using machine-learning algorithms ensuring increasing accuracy.  By offering accurate toxicity related information throughout R&D, ViridisChem will lead the standardization of toxicity evaluation across all industries Our Solution: We have built the most comprehensive toxicity database with over 90 million chemicals and 2.4 billion properties, curated using AI techniques, and are offering through yearly subscription, an AI powered SaaS software platform that provides toxicity evaluation (related to ecological, health and safety) of any chemical, even the new molecules, identifies local, regional, and per country regulatory issues and established thresholds related to the chemical use, allowing scientists to eliminate high-risk drug candidates. And minimize the use of toxic raw material. This is the Industry-first off-the-shelf toxicity evaluation product offering real-time toxicity evaluation of any chemical, even the new molecules. This much needed solution is proving to be so powerful, that ViridisChem received recognition by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) for offering solutions that will most benefit sustainability.
