Available with either 32 or 64-bit ARM processors similar to those in smartphones and tablets, miniNodes can host cloud services and applications, serve websites, crunch big data, provide failover capacity, run IoT services, and more. Why miniNodes ARM Dedicated Servers? Microservers have several advantages over traditional servers and cloud servers: Microservers use drastically less power than a traditional server, helping save energy and the environment. Microservers are less expensive to own and operate than a traditional server. Microservers are physical hardware nodes allocated only to you, and are not shared or hosted in a cloud. Thus your data is isolated and security is superior to virtual machines. Further, ARM Dedicated Servers are great for developers, students, and web designers: Developers building mobile apps for Android, iOS, and Windows RT can build, test, and deploy code on the same ARM Cortex architecture that most mobile phones and tablets run on. An ARM Dedicated Server can be used to verify code runs properly on the ARM platform, or to host back-end services for mobile apps. Students can use ARM dedicated servers to learn Linux, system administration, hosting, and programming while taking classes and gaining skills. Because they are inexpensive, microservers are a great learning platform and educational tool. Web designers can use a microserver as a cost effective way to host customer websites. This is an example of “right-sized” computing, where the largest, fastest, most expensive server isn’t necessary to handle low-traffic, non-resource intensive websites. A microserver is sufficient, and is a much more cost effective way to host sites.","Internet Services, Software",1,David Tischler,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
