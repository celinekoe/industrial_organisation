Impulsiv is a new way for people to quickly invite friends to join in on activities. Traditional means of notifying and organizing friends include texting, group texting, Facebook events, Twitter updates, and phone conversations. A mobile platform for impulsiv social planning has yet to exist; something that allows the boring gaps of our social calendars to be filled. Impulsiv lets people create spontaneous events and invite their friends to join them. Likewise, users will be invited to things their friends are doing. Without Impulsiv, people will continue to use ineffective means for social planning, and the world will be a little colder.   Impulsiv + Advertising = Invite customers in and have them bring their friends. Right now.   We are laying the groundwork for a new form of mobile advertising that will foster real-time impulsive customer acquisition. Businesses that use Impulsiv to advertise will see, in real-time, the effectiveness of each advertisement they post. We seamlessly transform old-school ""deals"" into impulsive social events. These events are no different from ones created by users. Ads will appear as suggestions for spontaneous planning that users will manipulate. Closed events between friends can be created, however, they can also be open to friends of friends which will facilitate exponential growth in attendance.
