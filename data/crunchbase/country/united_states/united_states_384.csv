Since 2008, their academic roots at the MIT's Little Devices Lab has taken their founders from the jungles of Ecuador, to coffee farm clinics in Nicaragua, to the sleepless hospitals of London and New York City to make medical invention tools that everyone can use to launch their own ideas. Originally part of an approach to reinvent the way MIT students were taught medical device design, their founders soon found an impact opportunity to train front line staff to go from providers to prototypers. Their DIY medical technology research gave way to stealth nurses in Central America---quiet everyday medical makers saving patients lives. Would they find them in America? Equipped with grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to find out, they created the MakerNurse project as a research study to understand medical making in America. Today, MakerNurse continues as part of the MakerHealth family spanning hospitals across America and around the world. They believe everyone can be a medical maker. In a world where health care technology is increasingly black boxed, and unaffordable, they found a stealth community of innovators working around the clock to make health better, by making their own devices to make us better. These are the health makers, the tinkerers and the explorers that inspire their team to create instruments, to rewrite medical education, and the build the invention infrastructure in hospitals around the world. Whether it's a prototyping kit part of tomorrow's doctor’s bag, or a MakerHealth Space laboratory dreaming up a prototype prescription, their global team is passionate about democratizing your ability to create and invent the things you can hold in your hand. These are the things that heal. And the things that their team is making sure you can make.
