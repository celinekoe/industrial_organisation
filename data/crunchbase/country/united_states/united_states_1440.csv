Now widely distributed in over 80 countries, the Slime brand came from humble beginnings. The first bottles of Slime sealant were blended by hand with a power drill and drywall blade in a garage on the Central Coast of California. In such close proximity to mountain biking trails and sandy dunes perfect for off-roading, it didn’t take long for the “green slimy stuff”, as it was often referred to back then, to develop a following. The Slime name stuck—and twenty years later their sealants continue to be at the heart of their business. With their Slime green sealants still being their core product, their commitment to being green continues to go deeper than the brand color. They are dedicated to creating products that are safe for the user, the tire, and the environment—as solidified by Slime’s Green Promise.","Health Care, Manufacturing",,,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
