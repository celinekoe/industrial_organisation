EMG Live Fitness is a technological breakthrough for the fitness industry.  The evolution of Live broadcasts available on the web has made it possible for EMG to bring the most sought after instructors virtually out of their studios and live to any town, city or borough in the country, or world.   Full length classes physically held in places like New York City, Los Angeles and Amsterdam, by world renowned instructors, are now available to everyone around the globe in real time.  When the at home student joins a class that is being broadcast live from a gym or studio, he/she becomes a member of an even larger national and possibly global community taking the class.  EMG hosts discussion boards and chats for users to share their experiences, ask questions and make suggestions, just like they would at a physical space. EMG is taking advantage of a growing trend away from â€œbig box gymsâ€, and towards more â€œsingular eventâ€ classes (like Yoga and Cycling) which are being held in standalone studios.  They are providing the platform and portal, by which, students can now select from multiple genres without commitment to a singular gym and without travelling from place to place.  EMG will not be charging for memberships, registration fees or administrative costs, just the cost of the classâ€¦on a pay-per-view basis.    By having full length classes available both live and on-demand, there are no more excuses.   EMG Live Fitness is a woman owned company and is based in New Jersey. EMG Live Fitness was founded by former Fortune 100 senior executive, Joyce Wells, a resident of Hamburg, New Jersey.  She is bringing the fitness studio online.  EMG Live Fitness is a technological breakthrough for the fitness industry.  The evolution of live broadcasts available on the web has made it possible for EMG to bring the most sought after instructors out of their studios and virtually live to any town, city or borough in the country, or world.   She is running this business, with her partner, who resides an hour away.  They use Microsoftâ€™s cloud platform to store and share files, video chat, instant message and email.  The cloud platform has made it possible for them to have a truly virtual office.  This enables each of them to make the most out of one of their most valuable assets â€“ their home.   When asked why she wanted to start this business and why she chose to do it from home, she replied â€œI love my home in the hills of New Jersey, and knew that in this age of technology, I could be just as productive from my home, if not more.  As to starting this particular business, I am a fitness enthusiast and just could not find the time to get to the gym, nor did I want to be boxed into certain time periods when I could take my favorite class.  I combined my expertise in video sharing, fitness and business to form this enterprise.â€ â€œAs I expand, I expect to employ other at home workers as much as possible.â€","Internet Services, Software, Sports",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
