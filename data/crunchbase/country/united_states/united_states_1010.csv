NOVEL RNAi TECHNOLOGIES The Multivalent RNA molecule (MV-RNA) represent a new RNAi trigger for the treatment of disease. The non-canonical structure utilizes the same RISC pathway as siRNA, but expands gene targeting, eliminates sense-strand off-target effects, and introduces the first 'junction containing' structure to RNAi. With an exlusive IP position and novel technical characteristics, Halo-Bio is working to release Multivalent RNAi based products that utilize MV-RNA's unique capabilities. EXPERTS IN SINGLE-MOLECULE, MULTI-GENE SUPPRESSION Multivalent RNA is an elegant single-molecule with advantages in molecular characterization, product cost, and IP ROI. While MV-RNA are more complicated than siRNA given their multivalency, Halo has the expertise and tools to apply MV-RNA to just about any series of target genes. SOPHISTICATED DESIGN, POWERFUL API, ELEGANT DELIVERY Halo has spent years developing design support in the form a a powerful computational array called, ""Multivalent RNAi Cloud"". This enterprise system ensures that products using MV-RNA as the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient are based on the best possible designs for efficacy and specificity. MV-RNA share the same mechanism of action with canonical siRNA, but they are simply different otherwise. Knowing how to take advantage of this difference is central to Halo being able to provide novel product design, function, and even a new form of RNAi delivery.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering, Transportation",1,Todd Hauser,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

They began a major remodel adding 10,000 square feet, including a Deli, Bakery, Floral, and expanded the Service Center. In 1996, Davis IGA was honored by the State Chamber of Commerce with the Business of the Year award for the northeastern area of Utah. In 1999, the Roosevelt store underwent a major remodel moving various departments around the store. The floral department was enlarged and moved to the center of the store and became a major focal point. Also in 1999, Jim and Debbie were given the opportunity to purchase a third store. It is located in West Valley City, Utah. Immediately upon acquisition, they remodeled the store. During this same time, the name of the stores changed from Davis IGA to Davis Jubilee. Over the same time the name has moved to the name which it currently is now, Davis Food & Drug. In 2009, Jim and Debbie were joined in the business by their two sons, CJ and Lee.
