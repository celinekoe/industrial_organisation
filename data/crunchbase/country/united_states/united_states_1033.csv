The BirthBuddy is an elegantly designed birthing device used to help new birth mothers through one of the most exciting and traumatic events in their life. It is a patented, non-invasive device, ergonomically designed to help birthing mothers push their baby easily and safely down the birth canal during the """"pushing"""" stage of labor. It is manufactured here in the USA from a soft plastic material at a precisely defined density that gives it the exact flexibility needed to be most effective in helping the mother. And, it works like magic!     The objective in using the BirthBuddy is to greatly reduce the mother's pushing time during the second (""""pushing"""") stage of labor. This is accomplished by causing specific muscles to be utilized, thereby increasing the force exerted during a contraction, which results in bringing the baby down the birth canal easier and faster. In a normal childbirth, this can often result in a safer birth by avoiding a cesarean section, vacuum extraction or the use of forceps. And, of course, less time in labor results in less stress on both the baby and the mother.
