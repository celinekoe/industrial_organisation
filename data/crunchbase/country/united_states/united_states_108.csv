In 2014, 60% of all online cybersecurity threats struck small and medium sized businesses/organizations.

Dark Sonar seeks to eliminate cybersecurity risk by automatically preventing common types of fraud such as synthetic identity fraud in real time. Other types of fraud Dark Sonar can prevent that stem from synthetic identity fraud are promotion abuse and account takeover fraud. The results are such that a reduction of fraud helps prevent damage to revenue and sales, customer trust, user acquisition ability, reputation, and more. Dark Sonar also helps reduce manual human review time expense and human resources needed to scrutinize application level events occurring on websites and mobile applications by automatically making decisions for a business or organization’s website(s) or mobile application(s).

The rehabilitation clinic was founded in 2001 with the goal of helping guests achieve sobriety and wellbeing through a supervised “open treatment” model.  Morningside Recovery provides a tranquil, serene experience for visitors while allowing them exposure to the world beyond the treatment facility. Though the open door policy is unique in the state of California, the program structure is based upon decades of research naming it as one of the most effective means of treatment. While many 12-step rehabilitation centers impose a 28-day lock down on incoming patients, this is not the only method for successful recovery. The clinical team at Morningside Recovery sets it apart from other rehab clinics. The staff is comprised entirely of Masters and Doctorate level experts, rather than counselors with just a few hours of specialized training. The highly qualified team is known for specializing not just in substance abuse, but also co-occurring disorders such as depression or latent trauma.  The real-world treatment model at Morningside Recovery allows clients the freedom to come and go as they please, attend courses in school, meet up with family and friends, or even work part-time. Clients are permitted to use cellphones and interact with the outside world. This flexible approach to treatment allows for the best quality of life and offers the greatest chance for long-term success because it requires clients to learn the everyday life-skills necessary to live sober and healthy lives after treatment. Finding treatment that works isn’t easy. Many people try and fail a number of times before finding themselves at Morningside Recovery. Once enrolled, however, the methodology is unique. It’s different from other rehabilitation clinics in the industry. Morningside Recovery offers more than just the traditional 12-step treatment options for addiction, with access to numerous alternative treatment tracks. They treat more than symptoms. Morningside doctors and therapists treat underlying problems by integrating the latest therapeutic services and techniques to deal with a variety of mental health and behavioral disorders. In this way, the staff is unrivaled when it comes to dual-diagnosis treatment.  According to one therapist involved with the organization, “Morningside has one of the most comprehensive dual-diagnosis programs I’ve ever seen. [The center] is problem-focused rather than symptom-focused, which is unlike the majority of treatment models.” At Morningside Recovery, treatment is customized for each client ranging from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy alongside 12-step treatment, to more intensive approaches like Dialectical Behavioral Therapy and EMDR. The clinic also has more than a dozen group therapy sessions every day, each one broken up into different topics and offered up to clients based on their individual needs. Morningside Recovery is a leading drug addiction, alcoholism, and mental health recovery center located in coastal Orange County, California, just blocks away from Newport Beach. The program offers clients the greatest odds for achieving and sustaining recovery from addiction.",Health Care,,,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
