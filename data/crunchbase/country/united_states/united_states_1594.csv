This direction has served us well, as we now enjoy enduring partnerships with an uncommonly large and diverse number of beverage and flavor companies all over the world. David Michael & Co. stems from a partnership established in 1896 between Herman Hertz and David Michael. Herman operated a bar on Ohio Avenue in Atlantic City, while David was a salesman for Fleer Chewing Gum of Philadelphia (a firm renowned today for their bubblegum baseball cards). David was a native of Atlanta, Georgia, and a confirmed bachelor. His principal pastimes were fishing and motor cars. In fact, before there were income taxes, David carried large amounts of cash and enjoyed purchasing motor cars off the showroom floor. Herman Hertz’ expertise was in distilled spirits ingredients. He originated our “Oldtime Special Body & Age”®, a few drops of which will make raw corn whiskey taste like a ten year-old bourbon in just a few hours. (Today, David Michael sells many DSP ingredients based upon this time honored formula, which is mentioned in “The Social History of Bourbon”). B&A’s popularity grew in these early years, but slowed in the 1920’s and did not revive until Prohibition was repealed in 1933. But then, B&A was adopted by several nationally branded products in which it is still used today.","Food and Beverage, Transportation",,,251-500,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Punch can update App content in real time, providing a publishing environment that’s as timely as the Web, with the fit and finish people have come to expect from tablet-native Apps.  Without the need for programmers. Founded in spring 2011 by a team of seasoned technology and media entrepreneurs with experience in digital marketing, iOS development, consumer media, and business strategy.  Punch is based in New York City. Punch delivers content, known as “mini Apps,” through three components. An App Content Management System (ACMS), accessible through any web browser, provides the authoring environment where tablet native experiences are assembled. These are crafted by first selecting from a range of technical modules, and then uploading into these modules the assets, such as text, images, video, and the instructions, such as animation parameters, that make the content dynamic and interactive. The end result is a series of items that, taken together, become your App. The content management system is accessible through any web browser connected to the Internet. Upon completion of each individual item, the content manager sends the instructions that constitute that item to the Punch server. The server exists on the Internet and stores all the items (assets plus instructions on how they interrelate). Think of each item as a “mini App.” On individual tablets, users download the client App. The client App is a vessel that communicates with the Punch server and receives the assets and instructions for assembling the individual mini Apps that ultimately constitute the end-user experience. Mini Apps can be updated in real time, and the client Apps then download the updated content. This allows for a highly dynamic and responsive publishing environment. Each client App Appears in the App Store under the publisher’s brand. No two client Apps look the same. Punch can update App content in real time, providing a publishing environment that’s as timely as the web, with the fit and finish people have come to expect from tablet-native Apps.","Apps, Mobile, Platforms, Software",1,David S.

This mortgage accounting software goes beyond the debits and credits to track transactions on a loan-by-loan basis. In doing so, loan level detail comes right off the mortgage banking accounting system and redundant spreadsheets are eliminated. In addition to providing loan level detail, AMB provides exceptional General Ledger, Accounts Payable and Report Writing capabilities. At the push of a button, AMB’s mortgage accounting software can present which loans comprise an account balance, any balance and at any time. Just as quickly, AMB can show which transactions have occurred on a loan, or range of loans. The ability to maintain loan level detail allows AMB to provide a level of profitability analysis not found elsewhere. Profitability by loan, loan officer, and loan type are generated quickly and easily, as is profitability by branch. The real-time nature of the mortgage banking accounting system, as opposed to older “Batch” oriented systems, allows for faster data entry, eliminates the need for time consuming posting routines and makes instant reporting possible. With AMB, accounting for mortgage loans becomes customized and tailored to fit your exact needs, which also makes your staff work more effectively and efficiently.

Kuss Filtration Inc. has over 60 years experience providing air and liquid filtration solutions to a diverse global market. The Kuss business was founded in Findlay, Ohio USA in 1949 by Ralph Kuss, who subsequently formed R.L.Kuss & Company in 1951. The first products produced were vinyl liners for sauerkraut vats. Ralph Kuss’ entrepreneurial spirit led the company to begin producing intank fuel filters as early as 1953. He directed the company into a wide range of products. At the time of Ralph Kuss’ death in 1979, the company produced filters, water mattresses, vinyl airport hangar doors, and vinyl swimming pool liners. In 1986 the Kuss family sold the business to Fleetguard, a division of the Cummins Engine Company and in 1990 Fleetguard divested all of the products not related to filters. In 2007, as part of Cummins’ global branding strategy, Kuss was merged into Cummins Filtration, and became part of its Light Duty division. In 1996 Kuss began manufacturing in France and by the end of 2007, Kuss had established its global presence with additional manufacturing locations in Brazil and China. The Kuss Filtration operation in Bloomer, Wisconsin was established by Nelson Industries in 1965. Nelson Industries was a supplier of filtration products and exhaust and emissions control systems. In 1998, Nelson Industries was sold to Fleetguard, a division of the Cummins Engine Company. In 2005, as part of Cummins’ global branding strategy, Nelson was merged into Cummins Filtration, and became part of its Light Duty division. On October 31, 2011, the Light Duty filtration business operations based in Findlay, Ohio and Bloomer, Wisconsin were sold to Industrial Opportunity Partners, LLC (IOP).
