Kim Perkins is passionate about design and creating unique, aesthetically appealing and functional spaces. A Caribbean born and Navy veteran, Kim always had a heart for serving others. She uses her exceptional skills in project management to take on multiple design portfolios with a focus on helping her clients turn their ordinary house into a dream home.   Kim had her first encounter with interior design when she retained a designer for services on her Gainesville VA townhome. She wanted to create an oasis in her home after a long day of work and commuting. After learning that her $5k budget would not suffice that designer’s plan, Kim took matters into her own hands and designed her first space in 2014 for under $3k. After successfully completing that, Kim decided that she wanted to help others achieve this same success in making their house into the home they desire and within their budget. “Getting your dream home has more to do with how you feel when you are in your home. If you don’t immediately feel the weight of the world disappearing from your shoulders then it’s not a home, it’s a temporary landing space.”   Kim has been able to help several Virginia residents achieve their interior design goals with the budget that they’ve set. “Most people think that you need to be a millionaire to hire an interior designer, that’s not true. A good interior designer can help you achieve the vibe that you are aiming for but it does require you to be flexible. You can’t expect a Restoration Hardware look with a Target budget. However, we can accomplish the vibe of luxury, if that’s what you’re aiming for”, says Kim.  Kim is a certified interior decorator and understands different design styles and types. She listens to the clients needs, learns about what matters to them most, takes into account their future goals with the home and recommends the best approach for design.","Design, Events, Media and Entertainment, Real Estate",1,Kimberly Perkins,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
