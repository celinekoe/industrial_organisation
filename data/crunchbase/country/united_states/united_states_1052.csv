But amidst this bustling marketplace, Vetty emerges as a beacon—a force of innovation that promises not just incremental improvements but a seismic shift in how hiring gets done. A Vision for the Future, Rooted in Today's Challenges Vetty is more than a platform; it’s a philosophy, a vision for what hiring can and should be in an interconnected, digital-first era. Born from an understanding of the intricacies and inefficiencies of traditional hiring processes, Vetty serves as the answer to the long-standing challenges faced by both employers and job-seekers. Lengthy, convoluted screening and verification? Those are relics of the past. In Vetty's world, the journey from extending an offer to onboarding an enthusiastic team member is streamlined, swift, and, most importantly, seamless. This isn't just about shaving off a few hours or days from the hiring cycle. Vetty's ambition is grander: to transform the very experience of hiring. From the candidate's first interaction to their first day on the job, every touchpoint is infused with Vetty’s commitment to efficiency, precision, and user-centricity. Mobile-First, But Human-Centric In an age where our smartphones are almost extensions of ourselves, Vetty's mobile-first approach isn't just a feature—it's a statement. A testament to the platform’s commitment to meet users where they are, offering them an experience that's intuitive and adaptive. But while the platform is undeniably tech-forward, its true prowess lies in its human-centric design. After all, behind every click, swipe, or tap is an individual with aspirations, seeking the right opportunity to thrive. Challenging the Status Quo At its heart, Vetty is a disruptor. Not for the sake of disruption, but to challenge and improve upon established norms that no longer serve our evolving workforce. The platform doesn't merely aim to fit into the existing ecosystem; it aspires to elevate it. By reimagining age-old screening processes, Vetty introduces a breath of fresh air into a domain that, for too long, has been mired in complexity and delays. Trust, Transparency, and Tenacity In today's interconnected world, trust isn't just a virtue; it's a prerequisite. Vetty understands this intrinsically. That's why, beyond its suite of features, the platform stands as a paragon of reliability. Employers and candidates alike can trust Vetty to facilitate a hiring process that's not just faster but also characterized by unwavering accuracy and transparency. Furthermore, Vetty’s tenacity is evident in its continuous pursuit of perfection. The platform is ever-evolving, always in tune with the needs of its users, and perpetually striving to be better, faster, and more effective. The Vetty Promise What truly sets Vetty apart isn't its advanced algorithms or its sleek interface—though those are undoubtedly impressive—it's the platform's promise to its users. A promise to deliver an unparalleled hiring experience that respects the time, effort, and aspirations of every stakeholder involved. To candidates, Vetty promises a swift, transparent, and intuitive hiring journey, devoid of the usual frustrations and roadblocks. To employers, it offers the assurance of efficient and precise screenings, ensuring that they find the right fit for their teams every single time. In Essence: Vetty’s Pledge to the Future Vetty isn't just for today. It's a forward-looking platform, designed with an eye on the future—a future where hiring is devoid of needless complexities, where candidates find their dream roles without hurdles, and where employers onboard the best talent with unmatched efficiency. In a landscape teeming with tools that often promise more than they can deliver, Vetty stands tall as a beacon of what's possible when innovation meets insight. It's not just another tool in the HR tech stack; it's the vanguard of a new era of hiring. To put it succinctly: Vetty isn't here to compete; it's here to redefine. And in its quest, it invites all—employers, candidates, and everyone in between—to envision and embrace the future of hiring, today.","Commerce and Shopping, Other, Software",5,"Bejoy John, Brad Heber, Mike Cerrone, Ryan Gottfried, Subrat Nayak",51-100,5,Seed,4000000,USD,4000000,4000000,USD,4000000,"(ERA) Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator, Newark Venture Partners, SemperVirens Venture Capital, Stout Street Capital, 3Lines",1,6,,Private,,,,,,

Titan’s principal asset is Probuphine®, the first slow-release implant formulation of buprenorphine hydrochloride (“buprenorphine”), designed to maintain a stable, round-the-clock blood level of the medicine in patients for up to six months following a single treatment. The outpatient treatment of opioid dependence with daily dosed sublingual buprenorphine formulations represents a $1.3 billion market in the U.S., and a seven day transdermal patch formulation of buprenorphine for the treatment of chronic pain was launched in the U.S. in 2011. This novel implant formulation is inserted subdermally in a patient’s upper arm providing continuous medication, and has the potential to enhance patient compliance to treatment, and limit diversion for illicit use and accidental exposure to the sublingual formulations. The New Drug Application (NDA) was submitted to the FDA in October, 2012 seeking approval for treatment of opioid dependence. In December 2012, Titan entered into a license agreement with Braeburn Pharmaceuticals Sprl (“Braeburn”) that grants Braeburn exclusive commercialization rights to Probuphine® in the United States and Canada. Titan received a non-refundable up-front license fee of $15.75 million and will receive a $50 million milestone payment upon the approval of the NDA by the FDA. Additionally, Titan will be eligible to receive up to $130 million upon achievement of specified sales milestones and up to $35 million in regulatory milestones in the event of future NDA submissions and approvals for additional indications, including chronic pain. Titan will receive tiered royalties on net sales of Probuphine ranging from the mid-teens to the low twenties. Probuphine is the first product to utilize ProNeura™, a novel, proprietary, long-term drug delivery technology. The ProNeura technology has the potential to be used in developing products for the treatment of other chronic conditions, such as Parkinson’s disease, where maintaining stable, round-the-clock blood levels of a drug can benefit the patient and improve medical outcomes. Finally, Titan is also entitled to royalty revenue of 8-10% of net sales of Fanapt® (iloperidone), an atypical antipsychotic compound being marketed in the U.S. for the treatment of schizophrenia by Novartis Pharma AG (“Novartis”) under a sub-license agreement based on a licensed U.S. patent that expires in October 2016 (does not include a possible six month pediatric extension). Substantially all of this future royalty revenue has been sold to Deerfield Management (“Deerfield”), a healthcare investment fund, in exchange for cash and debt considerations which have been used to advance the development of Probuphine and for general corporate purposes.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",1,Louis Bucalo,11-50,6,IPO,24200000,USD,24200000,54200000,USD,54200000,"Horizon Technology Finance, Deerfield, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation",3,3,,Public,2015-10-01,,,TTNP,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/titan-pharmaceuticals-ipo--45bc0ed9,NASDAQ

Their passion for cold brew coffee started years ago after graduating from college. At the time, both had corporate jobs, were training for a 24-hour obstacle race, and were running a group fitness company. Because of their busy schedules and drive to succeed, sleep became less important to them. In order to be their best, they needed something that could give them a quick jolt of energy. At first, they would drink anything that would keep them awake. As former college students, they started with what they knew - energy drinks. They quickly found that this was an extremely unhealthy option and one that would leave them with a hard crash once the sugar wore off. As they looked further into what was actually in these products they were disgusted at the amount of sugar and synthetic ingredients they were consuming. So, as any corporate employee would do, they turned to their trusty friend, coffee.  Every morning they would wake up 15 minutes early just to brew a pot of drip coffee, but just like everything else they tried, it had several drawbacks. The coffee took way too long to brew, produced a terrible tasting product, and wasn't convenient to take with them. Three things in their mind were unacceptable. In the summer of 2012, they stumbled upon cold brew coffee. It fulfilled all of their requirements for the perfect source of energy, it was natural, sugar-free, and simple, but there was one very significant drawback, it wasn't at all convenient. To make it on their own took them 24 hours and if they wanted to buy it they had to wait in line at a coffee shop. Over the next several years their love for cold brew grew, and so did their frustration with its lack of convenience and availability. They spent the next 2-years researching a way to create the highest quality product, in the most convenient way, and in 2015 they launched Bizzy - the healthiest and most convenient coffee on the market.","Commerce and Shopping, Food and Beverage",2,"Alexander French, Andrew Healy",11-50,7,,7150000,USD,7150000,7150000,USD,7150000,"SOSV, M25, Connetic Ventures, Bluestein Ventures, Sidekick Partners",2,7,,Private,,,,,,

Mitochondria are at the heart of complex life's origin. Likely a bacterium at the time, the would-be-organelle merged with a simple organism, entering into a symbiotic relationship: The mitochondria began supplying the energy for elaborate cellular functions to evolve, while the organism provided the mitochondria with an environment to thrive. Today, mitochondria are found in all human cells, except for red blood cells. They take on a pivotal role in cellular fate, as they produce most of the energy (ATP) and are involved in a large number of cellular and metabolic processes. The density of the organelles is particularly high in cells requiring a lot of cellular energy - e.g. cardiomyocytes or brain cells. Mitochondria function, and hence energy supply to the cell, may be impaired due to acute insults (e.g. ischemia) or genetic disorders (e.g. LOHN). Researchers at Harvard University developed an approach for mitochondria augmentation and replacement to ameliorate the damages from ischemia-reperfusion injury.  Ischemia is a lack of blood flow leading to an undersupply of oxygen and an impairment of mitochondria function. Reperfusion describes the re-introduction of blood flow, inducing an oversupply of oxygen. Both, ischemia and reperfusion, damage cells, with the mitochondria dysfunction being at the heart of the injury. The cascade of events, from ischemia to reperfusion, will eventually lead to cell death. The most prominent acute conditions associated with ischemia-reperfusion injury are heart attacks. At Cellvie, we are developing a means to transplant viable mitochondria into the compromised cells, to interrupt the said cascade of events, re-enabling the cells to turn oxygen into energy via the mitochondria.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",4,"Alexander Schueller, James McCully, Pedro del Nido, Sitaram Emani",1-10,2,Seed,10500000,USD,10500000,10500000,USD,10500000,"Taiho Ventures, KIZOO Technology Capital",2,2,,Private,,,,,,

Meetings between investors, corporates and the sell side happen everyday and WeConvene estimates that over 200 million meetings take place every year between these three sides of the capital markets.  WeConvene is a global SaaS event management platform that caters for physical, virtual and hybrid events. The WeConvene platform is available to Corporates, investment banks, IR firms, brokers, independent research providers and professional investors/Asset managers. WeConvene workflow solutions enable its clients to create, manage, promote, execute, discover and analyze any kind of meeting interaction with other participant/attendee.  Decades of survey data and commission flow data confirm that these meetings are the most valuable interaction for all capital markets participants. The problem before WeConvene was that all meetings were organized and executed using old technology or no technology at all – creating friction and inefficiency in the process. Due to changes in regulation, market structure and investment styles the economics of investor access have changed. The investor access market has been democratized and this has created the demand for a technology based replacement for the manual workflows that until now dominated these interactions.   The WeConvene platform delivers an 'OpenTable' style booking experience to its clients and their clients. WeConvene is an open platform meaning there are zero barriers to engagement and anyone invited to an meeting can book themselves in without creating an account. WeConvene is partnered with Bloomberg, NASDAQ and Intrado. Each of its partners has a significant and dominant presence in their respective markets.  As at June 2021, WeConvene has: a) 450 event hosts; b) 1,300 corporates directly and indirectly (via partners) using WeConvene; c) 150,000 professional investors in its ecosystem; and d) 3,000 investor events promoted each month.
