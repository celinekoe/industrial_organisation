One day, Charlie had an idea: maybe he could open a restaurant that satisfied the American taste for flavorful Chinese food that was fast and wok'd to order with fresh ingredients. Thus, the first Pick Up Stix restaurant was opened in 1989 in Rancho Santa Margarita, California.  Did Charlie`s idea work? You could say so. Today, Pick Up Stix is a leader in the quick-casual dining segment with more than 70 locations in California.  A big part of Charlie's success was developing recipes and sauces using the best traditional Asian food and adapting it to the American palate by reducing the oils and adding wine, vinegar and soy sauce. The result was the distinctive flavors that have become their trademark. Pick Up Stix still carries on this tradition and continues to prepare food in an open-style kitchen, allowing you to watch as your meal is cooked before your eyes.  The one must-try at Pick Up Stix is their signature entree, House Special Chicken. Prepared with white wine, garlic, soy sauce, and tender, caramelized chunks of chicken, it's their most popular dish. Other popular entrees include Orange Peel Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Firecracker Chicken, and Beef and Broccoli. And while they are famous for their Cream Cheese Wontons appetizer, you can also enjoy their Asian Lettuce Wraps, Egg Rolls and more.","Food and Beverage, Travel and Tourism",,,501-1000,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Long Hop networks are more cost efficient than a fat-tree, supporting at least 50% more servers using the same network hardware while providing equivalent bandwidth and improved latency of at least 25%. Oversubscription and fault tolerance can also be smoothly varied to meet cost and performance goals. Long Hop’s regular wiring patterns maximize the number of short connections and minimize the number of long distance connections between server rows or containers, thereby reducing cabling costs and simplifying expansion by reducing or eliminating rewiring. Long Hop networks well serve the needs of modern data centers by providing consistent bandwidth under varying load conditions via extensive multi-path support and automatic load balancing, allowing mobile workloads to be placed without regard to available bandwidth, and allowing services to be isolated in a multi-tenant environment to match the business needs of customers.  Long Hop achieves this by combining patent-pending wiring methods with a simple high-performance, TCAM-efficient forwarding method well suited to the current generation of network switch hardware and SDN controllers supporting OpenFlow or proprietary southbound APIs. The wiring method starts with a highly symmetrical framework well suited to economical, fault tolerant switching, and overlays another symmetrical network of short cuts that simultaneously amplify available bandwidth as well as reduce latency. The end result gives the ability to design and construct networks that precisely meet implementation-specific business needs.","Internet Services, Software",1,Anthony Antonuccio,11-50,3,Seed,1250000,USD,1250000,1250000,USD,1250000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

People still listened to the radio. Google AdWords just came out. Most local real estate boards just started to allow access to this new thing called IDX. A college student named Justin Tracy had an idea to combine PPC (pay per click) with IDX (internet data exchange) and after a summer of hard drinking... I mean programming, he created a product known as Realty Generator. After a few months of going at it solo, he got a call from a mortgage broker named Tom Ray. Tom flew him out to Colorado and a partnership was born. The two ran Realty Generator for six years generating well over one million leads and a ton of very happy customers. They sold Realty Generator to Market Leader in 2007, to take a well needed break. After a legally mandated three year hiatus, the two got back on the saddle in 2011 and started Kunversion. Kunversion was dreamt up to take advantage of all the new technological features the Internet has offered in the last few years. From cloud computing to HTML5, we took advantage of all the newest technology when building Kunversion. We are constantly building new features within Kunversion. It's all done in house, never farmed out overseas. That goes for our customer support as well. All our agents including our chat operators are located in the good ol' US of A. We pride ourselves on taking your feedback seriously. Most support tickets are remedied the day they come in, and most new feature requests are done within a week. The world of real estate technology is a very fluid one. Between the Zillows and Realtor.coms trying to take over the world and the economy trying to dig itself out of that hole, the future isn't very certain. We believe it is up to the small and medium-sized brokerages to take back control and establish their place in the market. This can only happen by taking control of the content they own, their listings... and using them on a website owned and controlled by them. This website has to rival the experience they will get on the big venture capital funded websites, including a fully functional mobile application. This will generate leads for the brokerage at the lowest possible cost. This will also ensure listing data is accurate and that leads are followed up on immediately and not stagnating in some lead warehouse angering the potential homebuyer. Without getting all political on you guys, we just want to let you know we are on your side. One of our co-founders owns his own real estate company (www.wrightinnyack.com) so we have a vested interest in helping small to mid-sized brokerages navigate the minefield of modern real estate technology.","Information Technology, Real Estate, Sales and Marketing, Software",2,"Justin Tracy, Tom Ray",1-10,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
