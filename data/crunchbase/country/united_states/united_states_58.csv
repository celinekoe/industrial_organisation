Our Meritocracy Club is creating the Human-based SINGULARITY. We are a tech Startup that works like a global social club specializing in the sale or exchange of consulting hours of members as e-commerce. Socialmeet is the first meritocratic marketplace, with a focus on empowering the best CEOs, founders, independent consultants, celebrities, intellectuals, professionals, and skilled workers to build strong reputations as experts in their fields while they enhance their social lives. Our website, https://meritocracy.club/, works like Netflix, but instead of watching a show or movie, customers pay for monthly subscriptions to meet and talk with meritorious members one-on-one for business or educational purposes such as guidance on theses or academic papers, receiving expert advice, language instruction, making friends, and why not dating? The best part of the platform is that coordination of appointments does not need to be a nightmare anymore. Because every week our members input their available hours, customers may easily schedule paid-only consulting hours with them. Alternatively, fortunate customers may be able to get a free half hour with our experts. Socialmeet is Co-creator of MERITOCRACY PLUGIN. This innovative new plugin: ""Meritocracy"" that lets you connect WEB2 (WordPress, 43% of the Internet) with WEB3 (NEAR Protocol). Meritocracy integrates with myCred to enable cryptocurrency-powered rewards and gamification. We won a grant from NEAR FOUNDATION and built the plugin using NEAR PROTOCOL technology. We are truly grateful that one of the most important protocols in Web3 trusts us. We developed the MERITOCRACY PLUGIN in partnership with myCred (one of the top five gamification plugins for WordPress) by WPExperts, and Socialmeet, The Best Meritocracy Club in the World, according to Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing, Safari, Yahoo, and others. The importance of this plugin is that any WordPress website owner (which constitutes 43% of the internet, around 810 million websites use WordPress in 2023) can easily convert their site to take advantage of Web3 technology without the need for coding. With Meritocracy Plugin, Business owners that use WordPress websites can offer their services and products and have access to the Cryptocurrency Market, which represents around 1 Trillion Dollar Market Cap and in the case of NEAR Protocol more than 1 BILLION DOLLAR Market Cap. They can easily convert their sites to take advantage of Web3 technology without the need for coding.","Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Commerce and Shopping, Internet Services, Professional Services",1,Marilyn Betsabe Alvarado Quiroz,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
