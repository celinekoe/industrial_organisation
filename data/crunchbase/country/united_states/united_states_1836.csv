The Italian immigrants were of humble origin, mainly from rural areas of Italy. Brazil was seen as a new land full of opportunities. It is worth remembering that Italy was undergoing a crisis of employment in the second half of the nineteenth century, generated mainly by industrialization. Italy had many people looking for work in other countries and Brazil needed hand labor. After the Slavery Abolition (1888), farmers opted for european laborers, rather than integrating the former slaves into the labor market. The Brazilian government campaigned in Italy to attract these Italians to work in Brazilian agriculture. Ricci family arrived in 1918 and went to work as ""settlers"" on coffee plantations of Alta Mogiana region in the state of São Paulo. When CMNP - Companhia Melhoramentos Norte do Paraná began the colonization of northern Paraná, the family, now bigger, acquired their first property in the town of Terra Boa - PR. In 1975 there was a frost that decimated the whole state coffee business. The family was seeking new opportunities to continue the passion for coffee. After years of research, they found at Monte Carmelo, Minas Gerais, the ideal place to start. The terroir is ideal for the production of specialty coffee, and the ideal altitude of 960m and climate with well-defined seasons (wet summer and mild dry winter). The main feature of this region which distinguished from the others is the low humidity in the time of harvesting, favoring dry grains naturally",Food and Beverage,,,101-250,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
