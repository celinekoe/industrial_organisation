This technological breakthrough represented by CSpace® has been recognized by the U.S. Patent and Trademark office, which issued 3DIcon patents in December of 2010 and September 2012. Patents #7,858,913 and 8,247,755 were issued to 3DIcon for “Light surface display for rendering a three-dimensional image” and “3D Volumetric Display.” These patents strategically position the company to lead the emergence and commercialization of volumetric 3D display technologies.

This success is due, in large part, to the company’s strong reputation as a trusted partner and its business savvy in continually adapting to provide clients with the services they need in a changing marketplace. There are few companies in the U.S. that provide the services offered by Westchester Publishing Services. Westchester offers everything from project management and editorial services to composition, design, XML and journal workflows – all delivered at a high level of quality with fidelity to schedule and budget. Many of the companies that provide these services are located internationally. Recognizing the efficiencies to be gained from this approach, in 2001 Westchester began collaborating with Antares Publishing Services, a Chennai, India-based production facility for composition services. Together, the companies developed a successful formula based on a shared view of the importance of quality, timeliness, and process efficiency. In 2008, Westchester purchased Antares to cement the company’s ability to exceed client demands for prepress and editorial services while maintaining the high standards the company is known for. The company’s latest step in ensuring the stability and reliability of its services in a volatile industry was the transfer of 100% of the company’s ownership interests to an Employee Stock Ownership Plan in 2014. Giving employees an ownership stake was a logical step for a company that depends on the expertise of its staff to deliver the quality, responsiveness, and consistency that clients expect.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment",1,Dennis J.

Those tiny studios were learning experiences, creative spaces, and all-hours cocktail bars; our biggest worry was the mess we’d have to clean up in the morning. We can count on one hand the number of times we used our kitchens to actually cook in those early days, but we always had enough glassware for a pour of wine (or, more likely, Crystal Light and vodka). But as our lives grew together, so our spaces grew up (thank goodness). We moved in together and eventually got married, and our apartments slowed down into cozy spaces for unwinding or hosting impromptu dinner parties. The meaning of home has changed to us throughout life, so when we moved out of NYC to look for a more permanent sense of home, we realized we had accumulated a lot (like a lot) of mismatched stuff from here and there.

Their online campaigns, grassroots organizing, and mass public actions are coordinated by a global network active in over 188 countries. The number 350 means climate safety: to preserve a livable planet, scientists tell us they must reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere from its current level of 400 parts per million to below 350 ppm. They believe that a global grassroots movement can hold their leaders accountable to the realities of science and the principles of justice. That movement is rising from the bottom up all over the world, and is uniting to create the solutions that will ensure a better future for all. 350.org was founded by a group of university friends in the U.S. along with author Bill McKibben, who wrote one of the first books on global warming for the general public. When they started organizing in 2008, they saw climate change as the most important issue facing humanity — but climate action was mired in politics and all but stalled. They didn’t know how to fix things, but they knew that one missing ingredient was a climate movement that reflected the scale of the crisis. So they started organizing coordinated days of action that linked activists and organizations around the world, including the International Day of Climate Action in 2009, the Global Work Party in 2010, Moving Planet in 2011, and Climate Impacts Day in 2012. They held the “world’s biggest art installation” and “the most widespread day of political action in the planet’s history.” They figured that if they were going to be a movement, then they had to start acting like one. Click here to watch videos of these global mobilisations.  Today, 350.org works in almost every country in the world on campaigns like fighting coal power plants in India, stopping the Keystone XL pipeline in the U.S, and divesting public institutions everywhere from fossil fuels. All of their work leverages people power to dismantle the influence and infrastructure of the fossil fuel industry, and to develop people-centric solutions to the climate crisis.","Other, Social Impact",3,"Blair Palese, Jamie Henn, Will Bates",101-250,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
