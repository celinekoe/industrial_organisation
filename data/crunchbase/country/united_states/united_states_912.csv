I would like to invite you to review our very successful word puzzle and mobile app, Unolingo.   Unolingo, pronounced “you know lingo”, is a 10x10 crossword puzzle without clues that calls for precise placement of each of the 26 letters of the alphabet.  Depending on choice of difficulty, each puzzle can be completed in 5-15 minutes and calls for a mix of word knowledge and deductive reasoning skills. Since its announcement last December, the Unolingo app has enjoyed over 160,000 downloads and our users have completed almost 2 million puzzles.  Appealing to all ages, over 75% of our reviews are 5-stars, and many report Unolingo to be their favorite app.  One of our reviewers offered the following summation; “It is like crosswords and Sudoku had a baby”.  Unolingo is available on all Apple and Android devices including NOOK and Kindle Fire.  The app is available free with 20 starter puzzles and additional puzzles can be purchased in packs of 20 ($.99) or in full Series of 160 ($4.99).   In July, our app was profiled by Amazon as the “Free App of the Day” and we are scheduled for a similar promotion in Europe in November.  We are also in talks with a major media company about book rights and possible syndication of the puzzle.   Unolingo is building a worldwide following and rapidly establishing itself as “The Next Great Puzzle”.   Please visit our website at www.unolingo.com.   Thank you for your consideration.
