The OPNFV community is collaborating on a carrier-grade, integrated, open source platform to accelerate the introduction of new NFV products and services. By integrating components from upstream projects, the community can perform performance and use case-based testing to ensure the platform’s suitability for NFV use cases. OPNFV will also work upstream--with other open source communities--to bring the learnings from its work directly to those communities in the form of blueprints, patches, and code contribution. The scope of OPNFV’s initial release is focused on building NFV Infrastructure (NFVI) and Virtualized Infrastructure Management (VIM) by integrating components from upstream projects such as OpenDaylight, OpenStack, Ceph Storage, KVM, Open vSwitch, and Linux. These components, along with application programmable interfaces (APIs) to other NFV elements form the basic infrastructure required for Virtualized Network Functions (VNF) and Management and Network Orchestration (MANO) components. OPNFV’s goal is to increase performance and power efficiency; improve reliability, availability, and serviceability; and deliver comprehensive platform instrumentation. Fostering a diverse community of developers who bring different needs, ideas and knowledge to the table means faster time to market and stronger code.
