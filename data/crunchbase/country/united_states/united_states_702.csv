Here are a few of the major mistakes to look out for when planning your trust or estate needs. One simple mistake can unfortunately cause a snowball effect that can lead to tons of lost dollars or potential legal issues for you and your family. This is the major misstep that we find clients running into all the time when they try to go it alone without the help of an experienced expert on their side. Unfortunately there are so many different technical elements to properly filing paperwork or making sure that all of your ducks are in a row, and the untrained eye can miss many things along the way. What most people don’t realize is that people can file dispute on assets for so many reasons it will make your head spin! Very often after trust or estates are set up by an attorney in Long Island, there will arise sudden disputes or claims from family members or friends or business partners that you may have never even heard of before.

Sales are exponential, let me explain by showing you my formula. It costs $2.07 for one Magnesium Fire Starter. That product sells for $17.99 each, and amazon + shipping eats 30% about. I end up seeing roughly $12.6 each product, and that means I make enough to cover the product, then another 500% profit on top of that! So let's do some basic numbers. Let's say we start off with $500, take away $80 for shipping and now divide $420 by 2.07.  We have roughly 200 products. So, we sell them for $17.99 we generate $3600 gross revenue.

The relationship between sports, media, and technology has grown significantly in recent years, as mobile device usage has soared and professional and major collegiate sports have increased significantly in value.  Sports-dedicated websites and mobile applications now allow fans to personalize their experience and track their favorite teams and players like never before. Despite these consumer-driven enhancements, this highly interactive and integrated sports experience is not seen at the amateur level – team stats, schedules and results are usually fragmented across several websites and applications.  Since real-time score and results updates are more challenging, live content is now shifting to social media.
