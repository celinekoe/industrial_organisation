In five years it's possible that most lottery play will be on mobile phones.  The Department of Justice legalized online/mobile lotteries in late 2011 and states began going online 1q 2014. T1's CEO anticipated this and created the largest array of top-quality online and mobile lottery/gambling games in the world. The NY Lottery recently picked T1's Bejeweled game (licensed from EA), out of 46 possible choices, to feature in its massive NYC MTA and TV ad campaign.  These are specialized games that have to pass muster with states and the three online platforms that host the games for 46 states and 120 countries.  T1 has created valuable IP - 4 patents issued & 10 more patents filed. T1 has LT contracts with the three leading online gaming distributors.  The contracts give them access to all 46 states and 120 countries. T1 has a huge amount of business already signed as part of multi-year contracts, creating clear revenue visibility, and a very substantial increase in revenues in the very near-term with financing. Financing will go to game integration into platforms (about $20k per game), and further investment in mobile and online content (all games are created in-house in Stamford CT), including engineers and artists, needed to expand production.   Orders are growing consistently.    The company's contracts call for IMMEDIATE porting of games to platforms (see Game Porting Schedule).  Revenues could reach well into the many $10s of millions in three years, and approximately $5 million in year one after funding.  See the summary attached. The company is seeking $5 million in equity and/or debt financing. Twenty percent has been raised thus far.","Gaming, Software",,,1-10,1,,1163000,USD,1163000,1163000,USD,1163000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

There are over 100,000 cases of HCM in the United States alone, often presenting more severely in young adults and athletes; unfortunately the younger the individual is when diagnosed with HCM, the more likely that the individual has a severe form. Although various cardiovascular drugs are currently used to treat HCM, there are patients who are not being helped by current therapeutics. In response to this medical need and based on encouraging phase II clinical trial results to date, Heart Metabolics is developing perhexiline as a therapeutic for all types of HCM.
