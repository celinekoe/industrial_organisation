PCL is released under the terms of the 3-clause BSD license and is open source software. It is free for commercial and research use. PCL is cross-platform, and has been successfully compiled and deployed on Linux, MacOS, Windows, and Android/iOS. To simplify development, PCL is split into a series of smaller code libraries, that can be compiled separately. This modularity is important for distributing PCL on platforms with reduced computational or size constraints (for more information about each module see the documentation page).

ThanksBud, Inc. will organize the numerous service providers that make up the service industry into a easy to use, online, instantly accessible network that allows our customers to buy cheap, affordable service with the confidence of hiring someone with proven work ethic and ability.   ThanksBud Inc., is an online marketplace that will bring together the world of technology to the service industry.  ThanksBud Inc., will do for the service industry what Ebay did to the garage sale.  ThanksBud Inc., will provide a community where users can search providers, offer them jobs simultaneously, and receive services for a fraction of the cost. The yellow pages used to be the only way to find a deal and a person would have to go through them all and call each provider.  Now, with ThanksBud Inc., a potential customer can go to one place online, read provider credentials and reviews, describe the job one time, and ask for a price that is lower than they most likely would pay by just calling the first person in the phone book.  Most importantly, this process will be free for the user.  Further, the small service provider will be able to access the advantage that the larger companies have of always having a steady workflow to choose from.  If times are slow, the provider can accept a job from ThanksBud.com and make money instead of just sitting around and waiting for someone to pick up a phone book.  ThanksBud Inc., will also allow the provider to offer good deals to the users in order to boosts offers.   In addition, ThanksBud Inc. is bringing cell phone usage into play with the quick and easy text, read, and accept method for accepting jobs.  The use will describe the job and all the providers will receive a text straight to their cell phones.  A lot of service providers are not around the internet at all times and ThanksBud Inc. will bring the internet to them via cell phone text messaging.  The provider will have the convenience of securing jobs as soon as the user asks for them.   Providers will range from lawn care, to home repair, to plumbing, to computing, to building, to mechanical and electrical, to personal services, and to almost any industry imaginable.  The beauty of ThanksBud, Inc. is the expandability of the company to more and more areas of service.  The beauty of expandibility is that sales can continue to increase in the already enormous market of buyers, gross margin will increase even more due to the small overhead of the company, and profits over the first five years will be through the roof.   ThanksBud Inc. has the potential to take over the lion's share of the online service industry.  The online goods industry has grown to be a trillion dollar industry in the United States alone and the service industry is just as big.  There just has not been an avenue to capture that market; until now.  ThanksBud Inc. is the online marketplace for the future of the service industry.","Commerce and Shopping, Internet Services",3,"Anthony Johnson, RJ Martino, Roxane Martino",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
