Businesses are also offering an extra percentage off if the client decides to buy something else once he/she visits the store. (ex. appetizer for $1.01+30% off the entire food bill). Businesses are self-listing those deals, so they can decide the number of deals, the day/s of the week when they can be redeemed, down to the specific time-frame (ex: 3x manicure services on Sunday and Tuesday between 10am and 8 pm).  http://www.adollarone.com/products/detail/127/classic-spa-manicure/ (link to the actual live deal). Why would businesses want to offer products and services for $1.01 on our website?  Just some of the key reasons: • To offset slow business on specific days and hours • To convert excess/perishable inventory into regular customers • To have an opportunity to up-sell these consumers once in the door • To introduce new products and services  • To provide consumers with a strong incentive to visit their businesses Why would consumers want to use this website? Because of the extraordinary savings • Because of the low cost and low risk commitment • Because they can try/test products/services for just $1.01. • Because we have yet to find someone who wouldn’t! We will be generating revenue from multiple sources, including $5 per month from businesses (they can list an unlimited number of deals), the retention of the $1.01 paid by consumers, the $1.01 one-time business verification fee, and various marketing and promotional programs. Market conditions are favorable and offer a significant opportunity for growth. More than 75 million consumers browse the internet for savings each month, while businesses have increasingly taken advantage of online promotional programs totaling nearly $12 billion. Adolarone.com delivers a unique, innovative web-based service – a fully integrated, all-encompassing web portal that connects businesses with customers offering products and services in a whole new format. Adolarone.com was launched on February 1, 2010 in the greater Los Angeles market. Venturino Piccolo and Nadine Curias own and operate the company.  To achieve the company’s objectives, Golden Piccolo, LLC is seeking $450,000 in total funding through outside investment.   The benefits of this revolutionary sales channel include:  • Great way to introduce new products to the market • Businesses can list offers for certain days or certain hours to offset slow business. Businesses will pay per customer and not per click or per traditional advertising space.  • Consumers are given the chance to try and test new stuff for as little as $1.01. • Members will have to register before they buy, giving the company's demographic information. Businesses will not be charged pay-per-print fees. • Dramatically reduce the waste associated with unused products and services. • Businesses could encourage repeat patronage by offering another coupon once the client has walked through their door. •With the company handling all of the monetary transactions, it can accommodate small businesses that do not have an online payment system of their own. Pay-Per-Click versus Pay-Per-Customer Model AdolLARONE.com enables pay per customer, as opposed to pay per click, marketing. Businesses pay nothing to post coupons on the company’s website and lose only the revenue that would have been gained from selling the product or service at full price. In many situations, this revenue was already lost as the product would have expired or the service slot would not have been filled. Instead of complete waste, the business has gained a customer that will potentially return to the business for future products and services at full price. In the company’s pay-per-customer model, each business only “pays” for the customers that redeem the coupons, as opposed to pay-per-click models where advertisers are charged for every person that clicks an online advertisement, regardless of whether that person then buys anything from the business or becomes a patron. This pay-per-customer model is a huge advance in online advertising and a revolutionary method of combining web models to unite consumers and businesses.","Advertising, Commerce and Shopping, Sales and Marketing",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

We just want you to know that should you get injured out in the world, whLaw is here to support you through the process of getting the compensation you deserve for your injuries.  Car accidents are all too common and all too dangerous. Even a relatively small injury like whiplash can have serious effects on your life and impact your ability to work and earn a living.  That’s no laughing matter. It’s important that you are able to recover damages. Another important area that whLaw helps is with estate planning.  It may be boring to get your estate in order but it’s a necessary step for those who care about their loved ones.  Speaking of your loved ones, not everything is easy when it comes to family. Domestic violence, divorce, and bankruptcy in  Jonesboro, AR, are all elements that can make your family life much harder, and knowing that you can rely on your attorney to take care of the legal side of things so you can focus your attention on improving matters is a real lifeline.  But don’t forget about your employment. Everyone has to work but some bosses thrive on finding ways to exploit their workforce. But there are rules and laws in place to ensure that you aren’t exploited or that make sure you can seek justice once you have been.  If you’re dealing with personal injury, estate planning, family law, criminal defense, or employment law issues then reach out to whLaw to learn how we can help you with the legal stuff so you can focus on the stuff that matters to you the most in life.",,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
