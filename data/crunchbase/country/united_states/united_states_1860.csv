In other words, FinestExpert.com was created to help real estate investors find properties that feature the best financial profiles, not necessarily properties with the prettiest decorator touches.  As the real estate market resets, savvy investors are finding tremendous opportunities throughout the United States, and billions of dollars will be made by these investors on home rentals in the coming months and years. But billions could also be lost; lost to poor investment decisions based on ""gut feelings"" or inaccurate data and forecasts. That's why FinestExpert.com was developed - to take the guesswork out of rental property selection, and to put the power of sophisticated investment analysis into the hands of everyday investors with the wisdom and insight to recognize truly generational opportunity when it knocks.  FinestExpert.com integrates the latest investment inventory data with truly revolutionary financial analysis software to create a one-stop tool for making important investment decisions. The FE-Score provided for each property takes literally thousands and investment factors, analyzes and weights each of them for relative importance, and produces a single number indicating projected investment quality. Think of the FE-Score as a ""credit score"" for investment properties, enabling fast, highly-reliable comparisons of investment properties without going through the drudgery of pencil-and-paper or spreadsheet analyses.  FinestExpert.com exists to make it easier for you to make sound investment decisions, and to get to the best properties while other investors are still crunching numbers.  Search for great deals on Denver real estate and Florida real estate and Las Vegas real estate all at the same time - because FinestExpert's unique cashflow search engine lets you search by what really matters - the property financials. It's really that simple.

The call and the price quote are FREE.","Financial Services, Health Care",1,Buzz Stone,1-10,1,Seed,325000,USD,325000,325000,USD,325000,Innova Memphis,,1,,Private,,,,,,
