Michael Welge, head of NCSA's automated learning group, recognized the tremendous benefit of offering more specialized, highly selective data analytics solutions to help businesses and governments gather, organize, merge and analyze data from disparate sources throughout the Internet. He then transformed the D2K (data-to-knowledge) software environment when he co-founded the company that is RiverGlass today. To launch the business, the company partnered with IllinoisVENTURES, a service firm that works with University of Illinois researchers to turn university research projects into viable commercial ventures.
