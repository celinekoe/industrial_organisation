In 2001, Action Greensboro commissioned the McKinsey Report on the state of economic growth in Greensboro. One strong finding was that Greensboro had been seeing a decline in numbers of 18- to 34-year-olds in the past decade. During the same time period, Raleigh and Charlotte had been able to attract young people from outside their county lines, increasing their absolute number of young residents and bucking the national trend toward an aging population. With this challenge, Action Greensboro created synerG.  Since 2001, synerG has evolved from developing projects like the installation of WIFI on South Elm Street and in Center City Park to program based initiatives with the goal of advancing leadership opportunities, voice, and quality of life for all young professionals in the Greensboro community.",,2,"Jitendra Arora, Kalpana Narayanaswamy",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
