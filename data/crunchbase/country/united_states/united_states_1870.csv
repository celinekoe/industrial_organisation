Clapper, Jr. as a Mechanical Contractor. Our relationship with The Dupps Company started shortly thereafter as an installer for their rendering systems. In 1978, Ted I. Clapper and Cory L. Kracht became employees of the company. In December 1992, Ted and Cory purchased the company from Ted L. Clapper, Jr., who now acts as company CEO. In 1982 after 200 field installations, Dupps approached Clapper Corporation concerning a distributorship and repair outlet for their equipment. From that point forward, we have been their exclusive Authorized Distributor. We gradually phased out of the mechanical contractor work and concentrated solely on this endeavor. We use only genuine Dupps parts in any of our Dupps equipment repairs. Since 1982, we have overhauled 2000 Dupps pressors and have performed similar repairs to 100 Equacookers. We entered into the prebreaker repair business in 1986 as a supplement to the Dupps equipment repairs. We also build a full line of Rietz and Anco replacement parts. We have overhauled 500 prebreakers since 1986. In 1990, we started rebuilding Svaertek equipment and in 1996, we became the Authorized North American Repair Center for the Danish company Svaertek. Svaertek is a worldwide manufacturer of rendering raw material grinding equipment. During 1991, we began to market centrifuge parts and repair services to the rendering industry as a manufacturer's representative. We currently offer sales, parts, repair and services on both vertical and horizontal centrifuge equipment in a variety of applications. We can design and size equipment to accomodate any and all of your processing needs. We have a vast inventory of equipment available for lease or purchase.
