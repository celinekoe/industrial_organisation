From designing a comprehensive message strategy to opinion research, integrated advertising, media relations and grassroots outreach, Purple provides a unique perspective on public affairs and the highest level of service and expertise. Why Purple? In our fast-moving, high information society, public attitudes are constantly shifting in ways difficult to predict – and even more difficult to influence. For corporations and trade associations, it’s more important than ever to respond strategically and communicate values that are aligned with society’s expectations. Adding to the challenge, economic uncertainty is fueling an intense partisanship that colors perceptions of issues and events. Increasingly, companies are being drawn into the arena – and subjected to scrutiny – in ways never anticipated even a few short years ago. But for strategists grounded in the dynamics of political campaigns, this kind of conflict and volatility is familiar territory.

Users are urged to ask questions and answer other users' questions, rate their doctors, participate in online discussions and otherwise contribute content. The site also has a number of tools to help people become healthier, such as a calculator that shows how long you need to do a given activity to lose a pound of weight, and a tool for showing you how much money an individual will save if he quits smoking. Every user has a profile page where they can link up to other users, set personal goals and aggregate content they've contributed to the site.
