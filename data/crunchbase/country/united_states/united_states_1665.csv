The co-founders joined together beginning in the early 1990s to manage risk assets including senior loans, stressed and distressed debt and to produce strong non-correlated investment returns in a variety of markets. Throughout their partnership the co-founders have applied the same unifying philosophy of risk control and value assessment, a core principle at FOC Partners. Today the co-founders and employees are among the firm’s largest investors which align the overall interests of the firm with those of their clients and investors. FOC Partners has attracted, retained and developed high quality investment talent with expertise in valuation, trading, structuring, credit and equity analysis. These skill sets are optimized across their strategies and products, defined by a team approach and credit-oriented proprietary research with a value mandate.  Their collaborative process creates a knowledge advantage to identify inefficiencies, capture value and produce attractive risk-adjusted absolute returns while limiting loss.
