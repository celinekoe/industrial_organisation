We deliver measurable engagement by linking advertisers directly to sports and entertainment fans.  How do we achieve double-digit conversion rates?  We don't interrupt; we empower.  Brands get noticed in a positive way that earns genuine appreciation. We convert passionate fans into loyal customers with exclusive and relevant deals and other benefits.  For instance, our Charitable Checkout app connects brands to our network of influential people and organizations, and their followers.  When fans give to celebrity-endorsed causes, they get brand-sponsored discounts and are publicly thanked by their heroes on social networks.  The app can live in e-commerce checkouts, on social networks, or as a mobile app that enables event-based activation (with instant rewards like VIP access).

Usually administered orally, with mild sedation, you remain awake or very sleepy throughout the entire procedure and can breathe on your own, but you will feel a great sense of relaxation. Patients typically recover from anxiolysis sedation within a few hours after the procedure is complete. Nitrous oxide inhalation is another form of mild to moderate sedation where you are very relaxed during treatment. Moderate sedation is used for patients with moderate dental anxiety and for patients who need longer or more complex procedures, conscious sedation often refers to the use of light iv sedation. With conscious sedation, you will remain awake throughout your procedure but will be in a deep state of relaxation. It is recommended that patients receiving conscious sedation have a parent, spouse, or friend accompany them to appointments because it can take several hours for the sedative to wear off, and driving may be unsafe.",Health Care,1,Dennis Stiles,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
