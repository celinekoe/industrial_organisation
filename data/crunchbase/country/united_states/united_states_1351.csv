The Baya Build Project: a community collaborating innovation for the building future,"333,007","Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",,Active,2015-09-05,day,,,,,For Profit,https://www.bayabuild.com,"Problem/Idea/Value Prop:  The largest industry in the world cannot respond to building demand with the price levels and quality that are needed.  Baya is replacing the construction method by enabling an efficient design-to deployment process using component based assembly for residential and commercial building. Innovation, technology and discipline enable Baya to disrupt the market and deliver a superior product with higher structural integrity, infinite configurations, at a materially reduced price in a significantly reduced time-frame.  Sector/Customer Demographic:  Industry: Construction Geography: North America Customer: Initially B2B developers then B2C end users Limitations:  Baya’s current focus is on the 90%+ of the world that is below 5 stories TAM >$1B: mass opportunity, multiple clients, multiple market segments:  The global market is over $10 trillion per annum. US market is $1.2 trillion per annum Round/Funding:  Series A; $20mm, $60mm post money (Set by lead Investor) Stage, # of Employees:  Commercialization; Staffing levels begin at 10 and increase to 31 by month 24 Key milestones to achieve with new funding:  Complete designs to fulfill current POs Q1 post funding Software design Q2 post funding First Assembly Fulfillment Center (AFC) Q2 post funding Begin assembly (fulfillment of POs) Q4 post funding Pros/areas of concern of team?: Highly experienced team spanning construction, finance, FinTech and high tech industries. Identified candidates for manufacturing and quality control. Founding team worked together? Do we know who they worked with from our network?: The core team has been collaborating closely over the last 12+ months.  All members of the team were introduced as direct referrals from within our internal network. Timing is right? Why?:  Global population growth is estimated to increase by 2.2 billion by 2050.  Housing demand is growing at a faster rate than the pace of construction.  Costs of materials, labor and shipping continue to rise, inflating cost of traditional construction Solution cost challenges:  Industry challenges include: market pricing and materials lead times. To mitigate, Baya designs for flexibility and interchangeable suppliers. Competitors/Timing/Who has TTM Advantage (how much): There has been an increasing number of companies in the modular building and modified container market. For example: Katerra raised $865mm in January 2018 from SoftBank to build offsite manufacturing plants. Conventional, containers, and offsite construction have limited configurations/styles. Manufacturers are limited by the geographical location and market. Baya Build is not factory dependent. Requires unskilled labor and is not limited to a template or a specific number of models. Substitutes available now and in future:  Now: Modified containers, prefab, offsite construction Future: 3D Printing Sustainable advantage:  Baya’s patent portfolio is a key protection. Baya has filed 9 claims to date and expects to have them granted by the end of 2018 Many potential buyers (exit analysis):  Home builders (Lennar, KB Homes, Toll Brothers, etc.) Private equity groups (Blackstone, TPG, Apollo) Technology companies (Alphabet) 10X upside potential:  Baya’s goal: 4 years to reach 10X Strengths:  Experienced and innovative leadership team, timing, industry experience, traction, huge market, growing demand, strategic investors/partners, pricing combined with value Challenges:  Execution, reliance on decentralized manufacturing and market acceptance ","Design, Information Technology, Real Estate, Software, Transportation",1,James Casper,1-10,1,Early Stage Venture,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Enterprise CIO and CFOs have little or no visibility or control of rising cloud computing costs. Permanent server resources are subject to continuous risk as a broad attack surface. Stratus transitions an organization, in the course of a week or weeks, from managing static server resources to simple dashboard control of resources on-demand. Deploying limited-purpose temporary servers with only instance-relevant software modules reduces dramatically the attack surface as well as the window of opportunity by exposing resources only as long as necessary (e.g., per instance, per login). Following deployment (e.g., per instance, per login) the temporary server is destroyed. These elegant, simple changes reintroduce financial discipline, transparency, and provide computing resources that are secure, private, responsive and on-demand. Stratus Digital uses on-demand servers with fresh software sourced from a golden image, and audits utilities within the existing cybersecurity environment, ensuring that authorized activity is controlled and carefully circumscribed. This on-demand environment enhances speed and surety of forensic investigations, and helps ensure compliance with regulatory and security protocols.  Access is truly a Zero Trust architecture, reduced to only the parties authorized and authenticated to the instance. In other words, there is no server administrator, super-user access or any other logical access control vulnerabilities, which are would be necessary evils--and built-in risks--required to manage and optimize static servers (e.g., repeated patches to stale software).

As a research, development, and innovation laboratory, the sNoise Research Laboratory (sNRL) is leading the way to develop plug and play Fractional Calculus analytical tools which include advanced digital signal processing libraries, signal-shaping smart filters, advanced machine/deep-learning toolboxes, and algorithmic mathematical solutions for specific fields-of-use in order to better extract the signal from the noise to reveal the hidden reality of information shaping the technologies of our modern world. A crucial step for the future is to consolidate the groundbreaking work we have done to push the development and adoption of the power of Fractional Calculus and integrate this expansive mathematics into deep learning and AI to spawn the next scientific revolution.  That is why sNRL is building fractional calculus toolbox libraries based on our patented Fractional Scaling Digital Signal Processing (FSDSP) platform technology for both standalone applications (SDK, API, FSDSP Chipsets) and for direct integration into Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. To use an analogy, with FSDSP, sNRL is building a fractional calculus-based AI (FC-AI) that is combination of ""ChatGPT"" merged with ""Shazam"" for digital signal processing that may identify, amplify, attenuate, filter, reconstruct, denoise, or synthesize any signal with structure. Our goal is to make Fractional Calculus and AI transformational and readily available to academia, science, businesses, government, and industry.  As such, rather than each individual researcher hard coding their own algorithms, fractional calculus AI algorithms must be consolidated and placed in a form of code-based libraries, in a variety of forms and fields of use, to serve as building blocks to easily incorporate these algorithms into modern technologies and data analytics. Having demonstrated our technology within several fields-of-use already, we expect sNRL to become a leader in the development of the foundational mathematics and algorithms of Fractional Calculus, embedded in AI, across multiple fields of science and engineering including aerospace, automotive, robotics, energy, and medicine leading to breakthrough technological advancements with beyond state-of-the-art performance.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Hardware, Information Technology, Other, Science and Engineering, Software",1,Jeffrey Smigelski,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
