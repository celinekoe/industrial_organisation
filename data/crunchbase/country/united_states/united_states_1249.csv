There’s no code generated, none to write and as a result there is none to compile, test or debug. By nature it’s perfect for incremental, iterative development. And it’s free to use to develop your applications. You save significant time and effort, while producing powerful applications with no compromises. The last point is perhaps the most important. Many people view rapid development tools as oversimplified solutions that trade off features and functions for speed, and in most cases, they’re right. axxun is different. It gives you full control over the objects you create – you define the details, intelligence and relationships of your objects, giving you the same degree of control over the details of your application as you have when coding it from scratch. axxun frees you to focus on the requirements and functionality of your application and not the mundane tasks of putting it together.",Software,,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Google keywords “USA raw denim brands, men’s American made jeans” or similar combinations and you’ll find photos of our products dominating the image results, while we also rank high in web page results, a feat impressive for a 1-man company with a small marketing budget.    Our mission – quite simply – to rival America’s largest and oldest denim brands which now produce overseas. By producing and marketing competitively priced, top quality, made in the USA products – leveraging our years of experience, creative expertise, streamlined supply chain, low overhead and web knowledge, we expect to continue to revolutionize the denim market. We are well positioned to become, the world’s newest “favorite American denim brand” not only because we are “USA made” at a great price, but also because our styles are modern without being trendy, appeal to a wide customer base and styled to stand the test of time.    Our fastest growth occurred during our first two years when we produced overseas because we had unlimited factory credit and were fully stocked most of the time. After moving production to the USA, our brand has grown even more popular but has slowed somewhat due to the limitations of having to pay most of our suppliers by cash only, while other suppliers max our credit limit at $5,000. This has limited us to restocking 2 to 3 styles every 45 to 60 days. We are consistently sold-out of most of our styles. Our customers love our products and many place pre-orders and do not mind waiting months for delivery.    It’s now time to hire a support staff, increase our marketing budget and inventory. We are building a powerful company that will be well oiled and will prove to be in outstanding running condition. Let’s power up and grow.","Clothing and Apparel, Commerce and Shopping, Community and Lifestyle, Design, Manufacturing",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Steel Partners Foundation,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/steel-partners-foundation,Education,"Aspen, Colorado, United States","Steel Partners Foundation was formed in 2001 by Warren Lichtenstein, founder and executive chairman of Steel Partners Holdings L.P.","2,773,440",Western US,Less than $1M,Active,2001-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,http://steelpartnersfoundation.com,"Steel Partners Foundation was formed in 2001 by Warren Lichtenstein, founder and executive chairman of Steel Partners Holdings L.P. (NYSE: SPLP). Mr. Lichtenstein created Steel Partners Foundation as a way to support philanthropic causes that are close to his heart. As a proud father of two children, he wanted to make a significant impact within the communities where he and his family lives and works, with an emphasis on causes related to children, education and sports. Steel Partners Foundation has provided funding to many different charitable organizations, such as Our Kids First Foundation – an organization which Mr. Lichtenstein co-founded with David Lascher. Our Kids First Foundation’s mission is to raise awareness and stimulate conversation about the issues and challenges of childhood including Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Mr. Lichtenstein is an executive producer of the 2014 film “Sister,” which was directed and written by Mr. Lascher. The movie, a selection of the 2014 Tribeca Film Festival and the Newport Beach Film Fest, raises awareness for children with ADHD. More recently, Steel Partners Foundation has begun supporting initiatives to raise awareness of parental alienation. On Friday, February 5, 2016, Steel Partners Foundation and the charity Stand Up For Gus, founded by actor Jason Patric, co-hosted a Think Tank on Parental Alienation in the Los Angeles area. Jason Patric has been an advocate for father’s rights and founded Stand Up For Gus after his own custody battle, to help alienated parents try and maintain a meaningful relationship with their children. Mr. Patric previously won a key legal battle to win his parental rights and in 2015 was reunited with his son. The Think Tank also featured guest speaker Professor William Bernet, one of the world’s leading experts in parental alienation and Professor Emeritus, professor of Psychiatry at Vanderbilt University and an editor of ""Parental Alienation: The Handbook for Mental Health and Legal Professionals.” The Think Tank focused on educating mental health professionals, lawyers and judges so that they can understand the signs of parental alienation, the etiology, development of symptoms, and treatment options available. Steel Partners Foundation, in conjunction with Stand Up For Gus, is currently working on further events in other cities and developing materials to bring awareness to this issue. Steel Partners Foundation made an early commitment to develop a Chabad Jewish Community Center in Aspen Valley, Colorado. Fourteen years later in 2014, the JCC opened its doors. It is one of more than 2,500 branches of one of the largest international organizations involved with Jewish education and outreach programs. Chabad recognizes no differences between Jews; its goal is to serve the spiritual and physical needs of each member regardless of affiliation with understanding and love. Also in Aspen, Steel Partners Foundation provided funding to the Aspen Art Museum, for its new building that opened in 2014. The building was designed by the Japanese architect Shigeru Ban, winner of the 2014 Pritzker Prize. The Aspen Art Museum is a non-collecting institution presenting the newest, most important evolutions in international contemporary art. Steel Partners Foundation also participated in the campaign to rebuild Tulane University after it was hit by Hurricane Katrina and 70% of the main campus was flooded. Mr. Lichtenstein, who attended Tulane University as an undergrad, provided a challenge gift through Steel Partners Foundation to encourage fundraising for Tulane’s rebuilding. Warren Lichtenstein through Steel Partners Foundation also donated challenge funding to the University of Pennsylvania School of Arts & Sciences to help establish 19 new student scholarships. Scholarship gifts ensure that a Penn education is affordable for all qualified students, regardless of their financial ability. The Positive Coaching Alliance’s New York and Los Angeles chapters have been recipients of Steel Partners Foundation grants. Positive Coaching Alliance is a national non-profit developing “Better Athletes, Better People” by working to provide all youth and high school athletes a positive, character-building youth sports experience.  Steel Partners Foundation also recently contributed to the capital campaign to build a new classroom building for Chadwick School, founded in 1935 by visionary educator Margaret Lee Chadwick. The only K-12 independent , college preparatory day school in the greater South bay area, Chadwick currently enrolls approximately 825 students. Honesty, respect, responsibility, fairness and compassion, Chadwick's core values, are fostered and modeled in classroom and co-curricular activities.",Education,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
