New combinations of crust, toppings are created daily, influenced by the local cuisines and food traditions. As the popularity of the pizza grew, pizza makers started to expand their business. The first restaurant dedicated only for selling pizza was opened in Naples in 1830, and after that many more appeared across all Italy. Local pizzerias are the cornerstone of communities across the country. They handcraft the one food that unites us all: pizza. It fuels our celebrations, family dinners, and busiest days. While pizza lovers crave their favorite local pie, they also crave convenience. This has led people to sacrifice the quality, authentic food of mom-and-pop shops for quick and easy chain pizza. But we believe nobody needs to make that sacrifice. You can have your pie and eat it too. Our menu is huge! Breakfast items, lots of appetizers, and if you add up the flavor variations, dozens of desserts. Sample everything! Your favorite take out restaurant in Bensalem!

Cheerboo solves this problem by having a social feed and also organizing conversations around dedicated topic pages where opinions are preserved and aggregated.  The site uses a binary rating system that makes sharing your opinion as easy as clicking a “cheer” or “boo” button. After sharing your opinion, the site creates a Rotten Tomatoes style “Cheer Score” that lets users quickly gauge public opinion on any topic.  The Cheer Score is an accurate reading of public opinion because you have to either “cheer” or “boo” in order to submit a comment, so no opinion is ever lost.","Content and Publishing, Food and Beverage, Government and Military, Health Care, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Sports",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

At that time, they only had a small selection of furniture. From the very first day, their  motto was to have the best selection at the very best prices in town. They were well-known for the variety of items they carried, and their customers would come in every week to see what was new. Slowly, they expanded their furniture selection and were forced to move into a larger space. They moved to a 68th & Memorial location, where they grew their furniture business even more. Their customers were very supportive of us, which encouraged us to grow the business even bigger. In 2004, they moved into the vacated Target building at 71st & Memorial, which is 100,000 sq. ft. of showroom space plus an additional 100,000 square feet of warehouse. As large as they are the employees and customers enjoy the friendly style in the store and the family atmosphere. Their  relationships and experience they have with the manufacturers allow us to source the best furniture for the money from reputable companies, providing the look, quality, and value that today's consumers are looking for. The incredible volume of furniture that their  store offers also makes for incredible prices. There are amazing offers as far as you can see from mattresses, dining room, bedroom, living room, home office, home theater to youth furniture. There is surely something for everyone.         They also carry a wide variety of area rugs, lamps, and framed art.  In February of 2013 they expanded the showroom another 20,000 sq. feet to include a full line of custom order upholstery from Klaussner, Palliser, England and Flexsteel. They offer an optional five-year protection plan for new furniture that covers fabrics, leather, wood, marble, and glass.  Finally, they have exceptional financing available (w.a.c.) and a 90-day layaway plan plus a new lease to own no credit check program.
