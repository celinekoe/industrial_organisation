The Challenge: Early lung cancer is asymptomatic. By the time it is seen on chest scans it has been in the body for years and often spreads to other organs making it very difficult to stop. If detected early, lung cancer can be treated with surgery or radiotherapy with a very high success rate. Today only 14% of lung cancers are caught early, and 84% of patients are late-detected after they experience symptoms and seek medical attention. Our Solution: Hawkeye’s LEAP (Lung Enzyme Activity Profile) diagnostic blood test quickly pre-screens the millions of people at risk for lung cancer to select the subset requiring full screening workups. This optimizes hospital resources, lowers healthcare costs, and reduces patient anxiety for greater peace of mind. LEAP can be repeated yearly as part of a regular health check-up. Our Technology: Hawkeye has developed a nanoscale protease biosensor to detect enzymatic misregulations in 18 biomarkers associated with lung cancer. When nanosensors built into the LEAP test come into contact with blood from a patient with lung cancer (any stage, any sub-type) they are detectable by Hawkeye’s machine-learning software algorithm. The LEAP workflow takes less than 2 hours and is compatible with standard molecular lab equipment.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",1,André de Fusco,1-10,2,Seed,,USD,,9000000,USD,9000000,NJF Capital,,1,,Private,,,,,,

Ohanae Securities will limit its business to digital asset securities to isolate risk adopting policies and procedures to, among other things, assess a given digital asset security’s distributed ledger technology and protect the private keys necessary to transfer the digital asset security. Ohanae is launching a Regulation A+ offering of Class B common stock which, will be offered—for $5.00 per share (the “Offering”).

In 2007, that vision was realized when OneCalifornia Bank and OneCalifornia Foundation opened in Oakland. Fashioned in the image of the great socially responsible banks and credit unions of national and international fame, the Bank is mandated to produce meaningful social justice and environmental benefits at the same time that it is financially sustainable. The Foundation owns all of the economic rights of the Bank -- when profits of the Bank are distributed, they can only be distributed to the Foundation which is mandated to reinvest those proceeds back into the communities and the environment on which they all depend. In their theory and experience, this ownership model aligns their incentives with the triple bottom line and the values of their bank customers. In December 2010, OneCalifornia bank acquired ShoreBank Pacific and changed its name to One PacificCoast Bank. The merger greatly expanded the Bank's reach on the West Coast, and enhanced its capacity to serve its mission. ShoreBank Pacific, a pioneer of environmentally sustainable banking, began operations in 1997 in Ilwaco, Washington, at the mouth of the Columbia River, and grew to establish offices in Portland and Seattle. Joining forces with OneCalifornia Bank produced an enlarged footprint covering a bio-regional territory some call the Salmon Nation and united the forces of social justice and ecological banking.  In July 2014, One PacificCoast Bank rebranded to develop an identity that reflects their vision, mission and commitment to their triple bottom-line, rather than merely the geographical region they serve.  Beneficial State Bank, pursues economic justice and environmental sustainability by focusing on transformative sectors that need loan capital. Providing credit to constructive businesses and non-profits -- especially those boosting entrepreneurial activity in inner cities, following and strengthening wellness models, or reconnecting vital rural/urban dependencies -- is their main business.  Credit allows these beneficial activities to grow and scale. They also believe that a healthy environment is the only reliable foundation for economic prosperity. Finally, the Bank must be a catalyst for positive change in their communities by providing fair, transparent, and sustainable banking products and services as alternatives to more predatory practices that otherwise unwind the benefits of their lending practice.","Financial Services, Lending and Investments",1,Tom Steyer,51-100,1,,,,,4957678,USD,4957678,Community Development Financial Institutions Fund,1,1,,Private,,,,,,

At the time, little was known about the functions of Android other than they made software for mobile phones. This began rumors that Google was planning to enter the mobile phone market, although it was unclear at the time what function they might perform in that market. Android has a large community of developers writing applications (""apps"") that extend the functionality of the devices. There are currently over 200,000 apps available for Android. Android Market is the online app store run by Google, though apps can also be downloaded from third-party sites. Developers write primarily in the Java language, controlling the device via Google-developed Java libraries. The unveiling of the Android distribution on 5 November 2007 was announced with the founding of the Open Handset Alliance, a consortium of 80 hardware, software, and telecom companies devoted to advancing open standards for mobile devices. Google released most of the Android code under the Apache License, a free software and open source license. The Android open-source software stack consists of Java applications running on a Java-based, object-oriented application framework on top of Java core libraries running on a Dalvik virtual machine featuring JIT compilation. Libraries written in C include the surface manager, OpenCore media framework, SQLite relational database management system, OpenGL ES 2.0 3D graphics API, WebKit layout engine, SGL graphics engine, SSL, and Bionic libc. The Android operating system, including the Linux kernel, consists of roughly 12 million lines of code including 3 million lines of XML, 2.8 million lines of C, 2.1 million lines of Java, and 1.75 million lines of C++.","Internet Services, Mobile, Platforms, Software",9,"Andy Rubin, Chris White, kinh can doi mau, Lloyd Gencay, Nancy Graf, Nick Sears, Rich Miner, SANDEEP KUMAR, Shradha Sharma",11-50,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
