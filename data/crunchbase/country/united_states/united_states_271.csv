Every day thousands of containers are shipped all across the globe. The time required is disproportionate to the actual work that is required to process these shipments. Numerous phone calls, emails and even faxes are required in order to process one shipment. This requires a lot of time and labor and costs a lot of money. Trying to track shipments is nearly impossible. The frustration level for both the shipper and the vendors is always at an all time high. Transship's platform is B2B and IoT. The User (shipper) simply has to upload required information such as what they are shipping, when, where, consignee as well as required documentation. On the back end, Transship will communicate with all the vendors via API and blockchain technology. This will not only speed up the processing of every shipment, but will also make it more efficient and require less labor. End result is a cost savings for the vendors and the shippers.  Each shipment processed through Transship will have a tracking device. This will allow every User to know exactly where their shipment is, real time updates and real time temperature readings. Transship also has an agreement with TradeLens to use their API and blockchain technology on our site.  Transship will replace all outdated freight forwarders with modern day technology that is so sorely lacking in the logistics industry. Transship will serve the global marketplace with the ability to process shipments from anywhere around the world. Transship will do to international shipments of perishable goods what Fed Ex and UPS did to parcel shipments; more efficient, more accessible and more cost effective.

And through the years, they’ve remained true to these roots. I first met Carlo in the winter of 2005. When not working as a materials engineer, he raced for fun and tapped his extensive experience with carbon fiber to develop his own ski equipment. As someone who constantly tinkered with his own gear, I was intrigued by Carlo’s work. Consequently, they quickly became friends and began collaborating on prototypes. Soon, some of the best skiers in the world began sporting his shinguards. And within a year of working together, I was able to take these products to the top of the Olympic podium. From this momentum and thirst for innovation, Slytech Protection was born. Immediately, they began turning heads. Yet their vision transcended the race course. I was part of a new generation of skiers who raced but didn’t wish to be defined or constrained by it. They loved hitting the park, slashing pow turns, and hucking cliffs. Like many of my friends, I was just as influenced by freeskiing and snowboarding as I was by racing. Consequently, Carlo and I aimed to embrace and unite all snowsports. At the time, this approach was as unique as it was raw. In the fall of 2006, they debuted Shred Optics. As with Slytech, their plans were simple. They wanted to develop products that looked as good as they performed—and not just on the race course, but also in the park and backcountry. Their inaugural collection consisted of a single goggle frame, available in a healthy dose of neon. Iconic, original, loud—whatever you called them, their goggles were visible from across the valley. About this same time, they also launched the first soft back protector with Slytech, which was soon worn by top freeskiers, snowboarders, and racers. With hustle and grit, they worked to further refine their vision for Shred and Slytech. When not slaving away over R&D inside a garage, Carlo hijacked a corner of his father’s office in Venice, Italy for their global headquarters. Meanwhile, they ran their US operations out of my attic in Park City, enlisting their friends as sales reps. They didn’t have a business plan, but they had plenty of ambition. Today, they have a few more products to their name, but their commitment to innovation is stronger than ever. Whether developing helmets, back protectors, sunglasses, or goggles, they’re pioneering fresh technology and emerging as a market leader—while proudly maintaining their status as underdogs. By blending performance and style, Slytech and Shred help you have fun, stay safe, and push your limits. And ten years in, they’re still building the products of their dreams.","Commerce and Shopping, Sports",2,"Carlo Salmini, Ted Ligety",51-100,2,,2500008,USD,2500008,2500008,USD,2500008,MIT Venture Mentoring Service (MIT VMS),,1,,Private,,,,,,

ZZ Biotech was formed in 2006 to focus on the development of 3K3A-APC, a novel second-generation variant of a naturally occurring human protein, activated Protein C (APC). The major unwanted side effect of APC is bleeding, which limits its pharmacologic dosing in man. 3K3A-APC has markedly reduced anticoagulant activity, but preserved cell-protective and anti-inflammatory activities compared to wild-type APC. In animal models of stroke 3K3A-APC has shown an advantage over wild-type APC in enhanced efficacy and reduced risk for bleeding. Additionally, the combination of 3K3A-APC and tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) provides benefits well beyond those found with either agent alone. ZZ Biotech is currently recruiting patients in a multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial of 3K3A-APC in patients suffering from acute ischemic stroke. The study is being supported by the National Institutes of Health through a pair of NeuroNEXT grants. The Phase 2 study is to evaluate safety, tolerability and activity of ZZ Biotech’s 3K3A-APC when given after tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), mechanical thrombectomy, or both, in patients who have experienced moderate to severe ischemic stroke.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",1,Berislav V.
