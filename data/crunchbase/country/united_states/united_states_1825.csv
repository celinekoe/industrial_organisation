DT was originally designated, as a Christian Club for young adults, by Bishop Charles Young, in December of 1997. On January 1, 1998, he held the first church service. Sixteen of those who attended the club became saved and filled with the Holy Spirit; they also became the first members and diligently worked along side of Bishop Young, to build what is now Deliverance Tabernacle Christian Center. Bishop and Lady Young, their three boys and sixteen members, produced a church on the principle that if you build the people, they will build the Kingdom of God. The evidence is strongly apparent by the fruits of our ministry. The facility the church began in, at 9420 Music Lane, was a workout gym that members renovated with their own hands. Within the ten years that DT has been established, we‚Äôve purchased over 15 acres of land that includes the building of our sanctuary, Family Life Center, the Soul Center, and other properties. We currently serve as one church, in two different locations, with the establishment of Deliverance Tabernacle Christian Center, located at 5470 Dogwood Drive, in Milton, Florida. Since its conception, this location has been able to maintain itself due to the efforts of our Department of Evangelism, which goes out into the neighborhoods on any given Saturday. Our Department of Evangelism also does the same in Pensacola, holding events that reach out to the community and draw other churches together to reach lost souls. As a result of DT being built on the principle of building people, Bishop Young has established ministries that cover every area, such as our Recreation Ministry for the physical man, in which we hold basketball, softball, baseball, flag football, cheerleading, and other leagues; Kingdom Finance Classes for economical health and others, such as Men‚Äôs, Women‚Äôs, Teens, Youth, Marriage and Singles ministries. We also have a ministerial alliance that produces exceptional proclaimers and teacher of the gospel, several who are now pastors, even as far as Puerto Rico.","Community and Lifestyle, Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio, Other, Social Impact",2,"Bishop Charles, Lady Lady Shaunda Young",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Hi. My name is Mark. I'm fortunate to be one of the founders of RichContent (along with the folks you'll read about here ). In 1998 I started seeing the possibilities for rich media and the internet. At the time, most of the folks I knew were still using dialup, or maybe some funky DSL modem to get online. But the first time you saw a cool animation or a recognizable image on the web, you just knew there was some phenomenal potential in rich media. At that time I owned an ISP (Internet Service Provider) and had just raised $2.3 million for a friend's online media startup. We made very large digital documents (like technical manuals for Boeing 757 jets) into super small and lightning-fast searchable online documents. I loved the concept, and believed that some day, rich media or RichContent would be the standard for the web. You could see Moore's Law compressing in internet-time, with bandwidth getting cheaper and cheaper and more ubiquitous, while internet users were jumping on the bandwagon in unprecedented numbers. And I wanted to be at the lead of this new media world. Except there WAS no new Media World. Not quite yet. So while I was waiting for cheap bandwidth to become available, I built one of the first desktop ecommerce software products (FastCatz, and then QuickyMart, named for Apu's 7-11ish store on our favorite TV show, the Simpson's).","Commerce and Shopping, Internet Services, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
