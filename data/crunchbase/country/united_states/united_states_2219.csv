The story of Crane Cams began in 1953 when Harvey J. Crane, Jr. set about grinding his first camshaft in the corner of his father's machine shop in Hallandale, Florida. An apprentice machinist, young Harvey became interested in ""souping-up"" his flathead Ford V-8 hot rod. Like most others, he was strongly influenced by the various ""hot rodding"" magazines, ordering his first cam from a California cam company's ad.  The first cam Harvey purchased performed well, but when he ordered another, he found it was not at all like the first, mostly due to manufacturing and machining inaccuracies. Harvey's machinist's training and hot-rodder's ingenuity had already taught him that camshaft design and accuracy exacts a critical effect on engine power. Harvey also knew he was easily capable of designing and manufacturing camshafts. What's more, he knew he could design more powerful, far more accurate and repeatable camshafts.  Today, Crane Cams has a significant amount of R&D and manufacturing resources to rely on, including an immense number of state-of-the-art CNC machining centers, dyno cells, Spintrons and a fully government-certified emissions lab. The company has the ability to produce fully digitized camshafts using Landis CNC equipment, as well as grinding cams via traditional methods using production masters. Quality control is assured through state-of-the-art Zeiss optical and Adcole equipment.  With the industry's largest camshaft database, which exceeds 80,000 profiles, an impressive manufacturing capability, and an experienced tech staff (most of whom have 15+ years service with Crane Cams), the company stands ready to provide customers with industry-leading quality products and superior service.

Nestled in the San Gabriel Valley in Southern California, all schools are located in Arcadia, California. Business Week named Arcadia as the “best place to raise your kids” in the entire state of California on two separate occasions. The District consists of 11 schools: six elementary schools, three middle schools, one high school, and one alternative school and outreach program. In addition to numerous National Blue Ribbon and California Distinguished schools throughout the district, Arcadia High School has been named a U.S. News and World Report Gold Medal School three times, named to Newsweek’s Top Public High Schools in America list, and ranked among the top two percent of high schools in California according to Niche. 2017 marked the second straight year that Arcadia High’s graduating class had at least one student accepted into every Ivy League University in the country. The District is committed to educational excellence, and this commitment is reflected in the outstanding achievements made by its students, faculty, staff, and leadership each school year. Each of the District’s ten comprehensive schools has an Academic Performance Index (API) score, which measures both academic performance and improvement, well above the state target score of 800 (out of 1,000) and the county and state averages. Highly qualified, dedicated, and professional, the District’s teaching staff is exceptional. With various professional development opportunities, conferences, staff development workshops, collaboration time, and learning walks, the Arcadia Unified faculty stays ahead of the curve to ensure a rigorous, vertically aligned curriculum that fully prepares students for college and career. In 2015, the district began hosting the Arcadia Innovation Summit, one of the premiere educational conferences in the country that is free of charge.   In 2006, the Arcadia community demonstrated its generosity and its commitment to education by passing a $218 million bond measure for the refurbishment and modernization of school facilities across the District. Working with an advisory group comprised of Arcadia residents, parents, and community members, the District’s Board of Education and facilities team has successfully managed the project, which has upgraded school technology and renovated all classrooms, libraries/media centers, science labs, sports/recreation facilities, and arts and music education spaces, creating high-tech classrooms and learning environments throughout the entire district. In 2017, the Arcadia community once again supported its schools by extending Measure A, a parcel tax that will last 18 years and generate approximately $77 million during its lifetime that goes directly to Arcadia Unified schools. As one of the most innovative school districts in the country, Arcadia Unified’s goal is to champion students and staff to Imagine, Inquire, and Inspire. The purpose of the District is to challenge and inspire students to make a positive and profound impact on their world. ",Education,,,1001-5000,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
