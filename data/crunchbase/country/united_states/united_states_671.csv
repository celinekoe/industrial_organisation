Being the biggest Black TV Network comes with great responsibility to not only our local community, but also to our village of black communities around the world.   There has been a new wave of so-called black television stations, black television channels and black television networks popping up all over trying to give the illusion that they are black owned when really they are not. Many black minds are being poisoned with content that does not grow black excellence. This is a disrespectful continuance of bad business that is as old as Jim Crow.  Black on Purpose Television is in fact a black owned and operated TV Network.  We complain about Oscars so White, The Lack of black representation in the Golden Globes and so many other situations that do not give us a seat at the table. The fact is we were never invited to the table. Rather than waiting and complaining for a seat at the table we can build our own! When it comes to black tv and black tv networks BOP TV has done just that.  The goal of this new change in black television was the brainchild of award winning record producer Michael Campbell while residing in Las Vegas in 2009.   Campbell, ""I saw many people complaining about the unfairness in the entertainment industry but rather than doing something about it  we were waiting for those in control to have a change of heart.    The concept literally came to me as an assignment from the creator"".   The company provides an opportunity for content creators to have their work featured and presented to a  worldwide audience and to make money doing it.  For black business owners, BOP TV allows them to directly engage consumers of color around the world.   Started in 2013,  BOP TV streams thousands of of shows (across 32 channels) to millions of daily viewers around the world.    The network can be seen on all major streaming devices including Roku, Blu Ray Players, Amazon  Fire Stick and Smart TV's worldwide.   Channels range from Arts & Entertainment, History & Culture, Kids & Teens, Education, Food & Nutrition, Health and so much more.   Content creators of color seldom have an opportunity for their content to be seen because the industry has historically offered them little opportunity... particularly for positive content free of negative stereotypes.   The industry offers unlimited opportunity for false negative images to be recycled constantly within the media which has lead to years of negative programming that has destroyed lives.   This lack of opportunity and diversity has allowed Black on Purpose Television To become the world wide leader  in attracting the 1.4 trillion dollars of African - American spending.   This is revenue undervalued and left virtually untouched.... Providing us with an incredible opportunity for growth.",,1,Michael Campbell,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
