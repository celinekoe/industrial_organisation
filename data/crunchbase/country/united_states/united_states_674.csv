This question set the nCamp team on a path to design, manufacture and market outdoor gear. Founded by Dan Cuffaro, an industrial designer and college professor, and John Cunningham, a product development executive, a duo with a passion for innovation and the outdoors. Our products are informed by years of cooking outside and a desire to avoid meals in a pouch…in favor of real food. Our goal is to help you create better experiences – great meals, in the outdoors, shared with others. Our products strive for three key characteristics: Compactness – a tight package that stores easily, allowing you to go to the places you want to go (for example, our Stove is fully collapsible and our Prep Surface nests with it). Elevated Experience – avoiding ‘roughing it’ by making things easier and better (for example, our Café brews high quality espresso-style coffee). Distinctive Design – the products are functional and cool (for example, our Stove has a hexagonal pattern stamped into the metal…this allows it to be thin, yet strong, while adding visual impact). Ever since we asked the original question, we have applied the same principles to new products – making cool gear that reduces bulk and elevates your outdoor experience. We are also committed to keep doing it! pack small / adventure BIG","Commerce and Shopping, Manufacturing, Sports",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The most important thing to remember is that stock market is an opportunity machine. Times change, gas prices change, fashion changes, regulations change, but there are always companies that find a way to monetize on an undergoing social and business trend and make their investors rich. The only things that change on Wall Street are the names of the winning and losing stocks. There is always a silver lining. One company’s rising costs are another company’s rising revenues and the market usually does a pretty good job of identifying the winners and the losers. Money never sleeps. Albert Einstein liked to say that “Any fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius-and a lot of courage-to move in the opposite direction”. No truer words have ever been said when it comes to investing. You could make your investing life as complicated as you want it to be, but the degree of complexity is not positively correlated with market returns.",,1,Ivaylo Ivanhoff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
