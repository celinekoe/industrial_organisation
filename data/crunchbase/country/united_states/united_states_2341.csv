Currently, many conventional drugs and treatments address patients’ symptoms instead of the root causes of the disease. This approach can result in ongoing health issues like non-healing wounds or diseases we merely live with like Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). SMSbiotech’s patented regenerative technology intends to change this status quo. Its approach addresses the lack of ability of many patients to restore cells and tissues that have been damaged by disease, trauma, and aging in order to positively affect their quality of life and longevity. The healthy human body has an innate ability to heal and the drive to protect itself. When the mechanisms that signal this response are impaired, the body needs assistance to restore that ability. SMSbiotech has established a newly discovered technology that is largely donor independent and ethically sourced from living, human adults. By using the right source and tapping scientifically into that inherent mechanism for regeneration, therapies and treatments can be developed to assist the human body in healing. SMSbiotech technology will lead to the development of more efficient and relevant medicines that will serve a broad spectrum of patients and reduce the overall costs of healthcare.","Biotechnology, Science and Engineering",1,Abdulkader Rahmo,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

This product comes with a whole new level of interactive tools and customization, revolutionizing the way companies can accept ticketing payments. Chris Lake, EVP Strategic Partnerships/UMS Banking and the key driver of this project, stated: “This tool was built from the ground up for mobile and social media. While perfect for the tech savvy millennials, it is simple enough for users of all ages. Its proprietary social media tool, unlike any in the market place today, allows events to quickly go viral on the net.” In today’s environment where Ticketing has become controversial due to issues with regards to fees, customer disputes, canceled events and more, UMS Banking sees this product not just as a savvy purchasing and marketing tool, but as a unique and welcome salve that either eliminates or solves these matters for both the venue and the consumer.","Financial Services, Lending and Investments",1,Joyce Gaines,101-250,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
