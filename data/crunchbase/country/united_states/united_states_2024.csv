They offer a wide array of installation services and assembly. See their YouTube.,"2,660,576","East Coast, Southern US",$1M to $10M,Active,,,,,,,For Profit,https://www.ez-level.com/,"EZ-Level is an industry-leading company in the home improvement market. The company is based in North Port, Florida, and was founded in 2009. Every product the company makes is developed and manufactured in the United States from the highest grade of materials available. The EZ-Level system was invented by Brooks Courtney, a seasoned home improvement contractor with many decades of experience under his toolbelt. The revolutionary EZ-Level cabinet leveling system has transformed the home improvement industry, offering incredible performance and ease of use. Innovation is the key to success for the company, and it continues to develop new products at a rapid pace. Cabinet Leveling, The Old Ways The task of hanging kitchen and bathroom cabinets presents a range of challenges to contractors and homeowners alike. First, walls and floors in the typical home are not level. As the home is constructed, slight warping of floor joists, wall studs, and drywall can create “out of plumb” situations. The walls and floors may appear straight, but as cabinets are installed, it becomes clear that a solution is needed to level them. Second, level cabinets are critical for subsequent kitchen equipment installations. Cabinets that are not level can result in damaged countertops by placing stresses on the materials used in countertop construction. This is especially important for counters made of natural or engineered stone.  In traditional hanging and leveling methods, each cabinet must be treated as an individual component. The first method developed for leveling cabinets is the shim, a wedge-shaped strip of wood or plastic. Shims are stacked under the base of and behind each cabinet to counteract the uneven walls and floors. This is a tedious process, and it has its share of problems. Shims can slip out of place or warp due to changes in temperature and humidity. When that happens, the cabinets are no longer level. Over time, this can cause expensive countertop surfaces to crack. Next, leg leveling systems were developed. Leg levelers are placed under the cabinet bodies on floor-mounted cabinets. Leg levelers use threaded adjustments, and these tend to lack precision. Leg levelers simplified installation to a degree, but do nothing to counteract the warping of wall surfaces. Contractors often have to resort to shims to get cabinets in line with one another.  The EZ-Level Solution When EZ-Level introduced its innovative cabinet leveling system, it transformed the industry overnight. This system uses a class one lever, here represented as cams on the body of the leveler itself. They are adjusted using a threaded adjusting rod. The adjusting rods offer incredible precision, rendering the cabinets perfectly level and ready to receive countertop surfaces. Cabinet installers can now treat cabinets as a single unit rather than having to hang and level each component separately. The cabinets are mounted to one another, and the EZ-Leveling system makes the leveling process a task that takes minutes instead of hours.  EZ-Level was able to identify common problems that professional contractors and homeowners faced when installing cabinets. By creating an elegant solution, the company was able to eliminate problems, turning a difficult task into one that takes only a few minutes of effort. The company continues to develop home improvement products that provide ease of use and innovation.","Design, Real Estate",1,Brooks Courtney,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

So far the results have far exceeded our most optimistic projections.  On half of the property we have developed a broad base of income producing enterprises and land uses that have turned a $500,000 investment into a $150,000 annual revenue stream.  It enabled us to dismiss a $2,000,000 offer from a Marriott Hotel development group.  They have purchased the property next door and will further enhance the value of our property.  Our next project is the development of a vacant frontage lot into 10,000 square feet of retail.  We have been in discussions with an anchor tenant who will use the space for a Latin American Art Gallery and artists studios and gallery village.  For samples of the quality of art we expect to bring to this market see malikafineartstudio.com.  This is the work of retired Peruvian banker and serial artist Malika who studied under the best artists in Peru throughout her career.  It is Malika's deepest desire to be an art ambassador representing her native country to her adopted country.  She will do so through the display and marketing of fine art from throughout the southern hemisphere.  She will also offer to teach what she knows and offer the opportunity to other artists to teach to all who sincerely wish to learn.   The subject property is directly across the highway from Texas State University (35,000 +- enrollment) and has good visibility to well over 100,000 vehicles per day traveling between San Antonio and Austin.
