Located in Middleton, Wisconsin, this rapidly growing company (currently over 40 employees, including 16 PhD’s) has a wide range of capabilities in the fields of molecular biology, vector biology, cell line development, biopharmaceutical manufacturing, protein biochemistry, and quality systems. Gala’s core proprietary technology is GPEx® (Gene Product Expression), a gene insertion/expression technology that allows rapid creation of stable, high-expressing mammalian cell lines for a wide variety of gene products. ""Gala"" is Greek for milk, and the company's original mission was to produce pharmaceutical proteins in the milk of transgenic cows. The gene insertion technology that Gala developed to generate transgenic animals became the basis of Gala's Gene Product Expression or GPEx® technology for production of recombinant proteins in mammalian cell culture. The genomics revolution has led to the identification of thousands of new genes, and the race is now on to discover, characterize and stably express the protein products of these genes in order to develop new therapeutic proteins. Gala's GPEx® technology, when applied to mammalian cell culture, accelerates this process for its biopharmaceutical partners. Once new therapeutic proteins have been identified for clinical development, production support becomes a major challenge. Gala's mission is to meet this need, and the company has recently established a 43,000 square-foot facility in Middleton, Wisconsin devoted to GPEx®-based cell line development and cGMP-compliant protein production.","Biotechnology, Food and Beverage, Health Care, Science and Engineering",,,1-10,1,M&A,10000000,USD,10000000,10000000,USD,10000000,"Advantage Capital, Venture Investors, Mason Wells",1,3,,Private,,,,,,

GMS enhances reporting under FASB Statements 116 and 117 and builds integrity into grant, contract, and functional accounting. They recognize the successful operation of an effective, efficient financial system requires more than simply implementing the software. For that reason GMS provides comprehensive, flexible support including telephone support service from 8:30 am until 7:00 pm eastern standard time (EST) Monday through Thursday and 8:30 am until 5:00 pm eastern standard time (EST) on Friday.

The Center focuses on under-reported topics, promoting high-quality international reporting and creating platforms that reach broad and diverse audiences. The Center's educational programs provide students with fresh information on global issues, help them think critically about the creation and dissemination of news, and inspire them to become active consumers and producers of information. The Pulitzer Center is a bold initiative, in keeping with its deep ties to the family whose name for more than a century has been a watchword for journalistic independence, integrity, and courage. When Joseph Pulitzer III became editor of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch a half century ago, he paid tribute to that legacy. ""Not only will we report the day's news,"" he said, ""but we will illuminate dark places and, with a deep sense of responsibility, interpret these troubled times."" The Pulitzer Center is driven by that same mission and deep sense of responsibility, in times just as troubled. Jon Sawyer, the Pulitzer Center’s founding director, is a former Washington bureau chief for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. He has reported from five dozen countries around the world and is a three-time winner of the National Press Club prize for best foreign correspondence. The Pulitzer Center is recognized as a tax-exempt organization under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.","Media and Entertainment, Video",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
