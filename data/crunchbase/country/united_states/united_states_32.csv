( glance at nature, perform tricks, glaze at the nighttime sky. ) He goes during the night and only at night because that's when he doesn't bother anybody. He goes alone. Meets a young girl, who also likes to ride her bike along the wilderness around Chicago. They meet, introduce each other, continue to meet during the summertime. They start to fall in love and devote their life's to eachother without the boys family knowing. The young girls aunt only knows because she has a house in the wilderness where the young girl likes to sleep. Boy is struggling with school and is having a hard time with college acceptance. Girl is average at school, acceptance is no problem.  Climax: The girls family is poor, can't afford college. Boys family is middle class, can afford college. The boy and girls love for eachother is grown so much to the point where the boy decides to change his last name to hers ( Sheffler ) through the Aunt which encourages the love between the two since it is so strong and powerful. Last name change is successful. The love between the two is so strong and powerful that the two decide to run away and live life between them two. The boy and girl meet up at their wilderness hangout and proceed to run away through their bikes. Before they do the boy decides he doesn't want to because he can't leave his family. He bikes his way back to his house meanwhile the girl rides next to him telling him to stop and how he promised they would live together. They start arguing, girl decides to cut him off. Drunk driver on the highway in which they are driving hits the girl. She is seriously hurt, critical damage. The boy and the girls family meet in the hospital, where she is pronounced dead. The boy in rage punches the hospital wall and goes onto the roof of his house and stares at the night sky in deep depression. Boy grabs one of the girls flannels from her room, puts it as a flag on his bike and rides with it whenever he rides.  Conclusion: Boy is about to walk out his house in attempt to kill himself in the wilderness. Steps on a letter and reads that it's from the college he is interested in. It says he has a scholarship for him. He goes inside and does not kill himself. He tells his family, they send an application to the college and he is accepted. The college sends an email and tells him that he can also redeem $500 dollars a week for his family if he writes for their newspaper. He graduates high school. His parents and the parents of the girl celebrate and hug him dearly. He goes to visit the girls parents, promises he will not forget about her and will do something for them that would make her happy. The boy has second thoughts about college, the girls family tell him that this is what the girl would want. He goes to the front desk of the college to confirm his acceptance. They ask his first name he replies ""Michael"" they ask for his last name. He stares into her eyes.... After a long stare he replies ""Sheffler"". This confirms that the money paid for him to write his articles will go to the girls family, and not his so that it can help the girls family and help them pay for their children. The End. Notes: Boy: Likes to wear blackhawks 2013 champs hat backwards. Rides on his bmx bike and night. Likes to do things alone. Isn't a romantic, ladies man. Content with his life. Likes to win. City boy. Middle class. Hopes to find a beautiful girl to marry. Wears t shirt and joggers. Very generous. He is funny and has a sense of humor. Girl: Tommy boy, likes to wear flannels, likes to wear a purple cap frontwards. Rides her bmx bike at night. Poor family. Can't afford college.

For more information feel free to contact us at support@scienteer.com -What is the purpose of Scienteer?- To bring sustainability to academic science based competitions, encourage community participation in STEM, and support student based research. -What makes Scienteer unique and/or different in today's market?- Scienteer allows fairs and schools to advance their students to higher fairs by bypassing re-registration processes and additional paperwork submits by keeping the process completely paperless. Scienteer's Management Dashboard allows each user to manage their progress in real-time. Whether you're a fair director, administrator or teacher, being able to manage students from their scientific work to advancing to another fair, the management dashboard makes it easy from any device. All data is managed in a secure online database system, eliminating the need for printing out paper. All required signatures can be done electronically or even on mobile devices. -What is the long-term vision for Scienteer?- Our hopes are that it will be adopted by the international community as the new standard for documenting research and managing the INTEL ISEF competitions globally. Eventually we want a single global community based on academic achievement with actual useful apps and tools that will help promote and sustain student based research. By making it easier for students to become involved in the science fair, we hope to help students prepare for a future in the STEM fields. -What problem does this site solve?- Student based research was dying because of the over-complicated, outdated and bureaucratic method of documentation. (Just like income taxes, too many rules and forms to keep track of). Having to sign and date things multiple times in the right places, checkboxes, blanks on forms with not enough space to provide the required information, etc. Getting outside signatures, complicated review processes... the list goes on. At the international fair in 2014, out of about 1300 finalists from around the world, almost 1200 failed the first round of review because of paperwork mistakes. Teachers were burned out, students were burned out. The massive amount of paper is a huge burden and cost upon regions and schools. To give you an idea: - Last year using our system in only 8 regions of Texas we managed and tracked electronically. - 24,372 research projects which generated 104,243 multipage documents which would equate to about 300,000 sheets of paper. - All of that paper must normally be copied and faxed multiple times for review and for submission to be handled physically at each fair. - With everything online, all reviews all submissions were electronic. Sending a student to the next level was just one click of a button. Committees reviewed projects in real time online from home and students are notified in real time of their status. The online system allowed teams to collaborate and work together even if they were from different cities, states or regions. Regions were able to monitor their schools progresses in real time, schools their students, etc. Teachers/mentors were able to jump in remotely and help students who were stuck. All data is stored in a database, our lists of schools and students is far more extensive than any other. We include home-schools, private schools, parochial schools, co-ops, science clubs, charter schools, parents, students, mentors, teachers etc. Funding is needed for additional development and sustainability of Scienteer. We design the tools from user's feedback, while focusing on what value can Scienteer bring to our students today that will impact our communities and the world of tomorrow. Such as: - Help with finding research laboratories for students in need. - Connect teachers, students, and parents to suppliers and resources - CV and college application documentation generation - Internship and Mentorship connections - Creation of a pathway to higher education and the STEM workforce.","Education, Software",4,"Derek Diaz Correa, Kai Kamaka, Rocky Slavin, Russell Cowen",1-10,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
