It is one of the most recognizable buildings in Washington, D.C. and was designed by James Hoban, an Irish-born and-trained architect who won a competition organized by President George Washington and Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson in 1792. President John Adams, elected in 1796 as the second President, was the first resident of the White House. Abigail Adams, President Adams' wife, was known to have complained about the largely unfinished new residence. President Thomas Jefferson, upon moving to the house in 1801, was also not impressed, and dismissed the house as being too big. Jefferson made several structural changes under architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe such as the addition of terrace-pavilions on either side of the main building and single-story wings for storage. In addition to replacing the slate roof with one of sheet iron, Jefferson further improved the grounds by landscaping them in a picturesque manner. While James Madison was President from 1809 to 1817, the White House was torched by the British in the War of 1812. Although the fire was put out by a summer thunderstorm, all that remained were the outside, charred walls and the interior brick walls. Madison brought Hoban back to restore the mansion, which took three years. It was during this construction that the house was painted white. Hoban later added the South and North Porticos, using a slightly altered design by Latrobe. Thereafter, further more alterations were made. Today, the White House Complex includes the executive residence, west wing, east wing, the Eisenhower executive office building—the former state department, which now houses offices for the president's staff and the vice president—and Blair House, a guest residence. The executive residence is made up of six stories—the ground floor, state floor, second floor, and third floor, as well as a two-story basement. The term White House is often used as a metonym for the Executive Office of the President of the United States and for the president's administration and advisers in general. The property is a National Heritage Site owned by the National Park Service and is part of the President's Park. In 2007, it was ranked second on the American Institute of Architects list of America's Favorite Architecture.","Government and Military, Other, Real Estate",2,"Devendter Meheto, Dylan Birner",1001-5000,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

COACHD provides personal training and nutrition guidance via smartphone, tablet, or desktop with elite coaches, where anyone (over the age of 13) can get help from a certified professional without traveling to a brick and mortar gym or office for their guidance.  The app is available on iPhone and Android.  Clients are paired with a COACHD fitness and/or nutrition professional by a customer success specialist or can select one from several suggested by a matching algorithm.  Fitness and nutrition programs offered by coaches include National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM) based training and other scientifically supported training and nutrition programs. The platform works via unlimited messaging where fitness professionals respond one to three times per day, and conversations are seamless across devices.  The same privacy rules governing clients’ confidentiality and protection exist as in brick and mortar training.   All fitness professionals are certified, have personal training business insurance, and screening involves background-checks, technical and service training, and interviews. Similar to brick and mortar fitness, clients work with their trainer in a structured environment to set goals and work through health and fitness challenges.  Goals are continually assessed and clients play an active role in their fitness journey by providing feedback to their coach.
