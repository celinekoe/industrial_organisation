Why? Well, because comment sections are mostly unmoderated public fora that remind us of the old, wild west: they're lawless, dangerous, and itchy. They've made us laugh, made us cry, and they've given us Cholera. We think it's about time that someone held a mirror up to comment sections to show that comment sections (defined both by anonymity and immediacy) offer us a cross-section of human interaction on the Web -- for better and for worse. Comment sections are a free-for-all and, as such, they offer us a telling glimpse into our behavior in a modern, digital democracy. So, we're taking it upon ourselves to cull together the funniest, craziest, and most offensive of these public galleries for your amusement and edification. We then add our own commentary to these comments (because we can't help ourselves) and, naturally, allow you the opportunity to comment on the comments or to comment on our comments about the comments -- in our own comment sections! If that didn't make your head explode, join us. Of course, we can't do it alone, so we ask for your help! The Internet is a yawning gulf of recipes, cat videos, porn and Kanye, and we can't possibly hope to cover it all with our microscopes. So, if, in your perusal of Wolf Blitzer's blog, you see a gem down there in the comment section, tell us about it. You can submit your own comments, images, and videos at TheCommentsSection.com or email Feedback@TheCommentsSection.com. We hope you'll join us -- and click on our ads. We've just launched, so if you have suggestions, please let us know. We're willing to change so that you don't have to.
