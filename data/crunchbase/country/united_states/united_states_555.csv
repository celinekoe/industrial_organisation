Many companies are creating venues for the small business owner with models that charge pay per click fees, flat rate fees or final value sales fees that are just not realistic for the small business owner who wants to do business online. Large companies are seeing the small business sellers as more of a money making opportunity than the ability to create profits from the merits of their product. The cost for doing business online continues to grow with only the companies that can pay the large seller fees surviving.  MyAuctionPlanet.com has been running an ecommerce platform for small businesses for nearly two years. The site offers a limited time no cost solution for small business owners to share their inventory in a way that is impossible for many new to the ecommerce arena.  The first benefit is that small business owners who place their inventory on MyAuctionPlanet.com will have their products feed to hundreds of shopping websites. Some of the top shopping engines in the Internet are included: - Google Product Search - TheFind - Oodle - Bing Shopping - Vast - ShopWiki - Yakaz - And many more Another benefit is choice when purchasing or selling. One solution does not fit all ecommerce situations. Many ecommerce companies want sellers to use their payment systems or platforms exclusively. Shoppers want to feel secure when making a purchase of the Internet without being forced into one option. Shoppers want choices when purchasing products with payment systems already known and trusted. MyAuctionPlanet.com offers shopping checkout solutions from: - PayPal - Google Checkout - Amazon Payments - NoChex - MoneyBookers - WorldPay - And many more Combine this concept with the right balance of marketing power of the venue/website to create a means to sustain a business online.",Commerce and Shopping,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Vendors receive training on how to sell the papers and get to keep 100 percent of the profit.

Whether enjoying time around the stove, grill or smoker, their family's commitment to sharing great food while making lasting memories, form their company's foundation.  Many of their recipes have been handed down father to son, mother to daughter, generation to generation. Others are the latest addition to their family each carefully crafted with the freshest ingredients and tested for the finest flavor. Their recipes evolved as their family has grown and married into other cultures. Merging new flavors and spices into new recipes while still holding on to the traditional ones. All of the while working hard to keep true to the idea of using fresh locally grown and diverse food products. Cheri and Jeff founded Deep River Specialty Foods in 1992 and though they took a break for a short while, they have worked to realize their dream of a sustainable business that doesn't sacrifice quality.  Over 23 years later with the help of their sons and grandchildren the company is still a small hands-on business. The jam they serve and the barbecue sauces they grill with, are the same ones made in the Deep River Specialty Foods kitchen.

We execute quickly and efficiently to help you achieve your marketing and sales goals. We live in a time of fast-paced, ever-growing global competition. Successful businesses know how to maximize their marketing and sales departments. Marketing is extensively more important to your bottom line than simply focusing at the top of the sales funnel. Salespeople and marketers don’t often see eye to eye on the quality of leads coming from their marketing department. The digital environment that the modern business must navigate is complicated and demanding, and salespeople and marketers need to work together in harmony for the company to succeed. Marketing’s objective, as a whole, is to create and further develop opportunities and build relationships with potential customers. Sales effectively converts those opportunities into revenues for the company. We began to help achieve this success for clients by counseling them to employ a more collaborative and unified marketing and sales method, allowing them to experience amazing success with their business ventures. We like to employ what is called a more Holistic Marketing and Sales method for our clients. Holistic Marketing can be defined as a marketing blueprint which is developed by deliberating about the business as a whole, its post in the economy, society, and the lives of its customers endeavors to develop and maintain multiple outlooks on the company’s commercial activities.","Information Technology, Other, Professional Services, Software",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Wet N Ply was developed in conjunction with the input of contractors in the US and Canada.    Wet N Ply uses a water based adhesive, which adheres to the drywall, replacing the initial coat of joint compound in the first step of the drywall installation process, thereby cutting application time and materials by an average of 33%. Development of a prototype and field testing have been successfully completed.    In conjunction with tape, Badger Innovative Technologies has also developed a drywall taping tool, Tech Tool, which can replace the """"bazooka"""", a drywall taping tool commonly used by contractors today. The Tech Tool can be operated by lesser skilled labor, thereby reducing labor costs by at least 25%. The Tech Tool is also lighter in weight and more mobile than the conventional bazooka. Development of a prototype and field testing have been successfully completed.    Badger Innovative Technologies will initially focus its attention on the residential, commercial construction, and renovation markets. We are partnering with an international distributor of building materials that is ready to take the products to markets in the US and Canada.     We will also work with Mfg Reps, that had been set up previously, to service an established network of 450 dealers throughout the US and Canada. Later the company will move into the Do It Yourself (DIY) markets in the US and Canada. As brand recognition and traction is achieved in these markets, Innovative Tech will expand to other countries.    Both of these new products will be protected by patents issued in the US, Canada, and other countries throughout the world where drywalling is done.","Manufacturing, Real Estate",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

How It Works: CREATE – Post an everyday decision and two choices. VOTE - Other users vote on which choice you should pick. DECIDE - Review the votes, make your decision, and share the outcome of your decision with everyone who voted. Launch a WeeAct campaign around any decision using text and pictures. Here are some example decisions that WeeAct can help you make: - Fashion: What outfit should I wear? - Lifestyle: Which haircut should I get? - Consumer: What brand should I buy? - Blogging: Which tutorial should I post next on my blog? - Events: Which party should I go to tonight? - Design: What color should I paint my room? - Investing: Which stock should I buy? - Romance: Who should I go out on a date with? - Education: Which class should I enroll in? - Fitness: What should I do for my workout? - Health: What food should I eat on my diet? - Social: Which picture should I use in my profile? WeeAct Benefits: ● Create a decision campaign and harness the wisdom of the crowd in just seconds. ● Don't passively browse content. Participate in the decision-making of other users by voting on their choices and inspiring them to act. ● Stop scrolling through feeds of content that you don't care about. Automatically personalize your feed on WeeAct because every time you vote on a decision, you'll receive relevant content that shows the outcome. ● Stop wasting time looking at ads. WeeAct does not support or show ads anywhere on the app and all of our content is crowd-sourced by regular, everyday people, just like you! ● Think you give good advice? See for yourself using WeeAct's Voting Accuracy which tracks how often what you picked is the choice that gets made. ● Get feedback without the noise. Harassment is a major issue on some apps, but on WeeAct users cannot message each other and no one can post comments on campaigns. ● Create content your audience wants. Make your audience feel like they are part of the creative decision-making process by crowd-voting your content on WeeAct. ● Use our 5-star rating system to rate each other's decisions based on the success or failure of the outcome. ● Increase your vote totals by sharing your WeeAct campaigns on different social networks. ● WeeAct is committed to protecting all user data on our application. We do not sell or share any user data with third parties. The Human Intelligence App: WeeAct has been designed to take advantage of human intelligence by eliminating biases that exist within the crowd. Each voter is ambiguous to the decision-maker, which allows people to vote, honestly, based on their own experiences with that decision. The crowd becomes smarter as more votes are cast on any single decision by eliminating these biases. If life is just a series of decisions, WeeAct is too valuable of a utility not to use. If you struggle to make decisions, WeeAct will revolutionize your life. Download our app for free today and start making smarter decisions . . . together. Got feedback?
