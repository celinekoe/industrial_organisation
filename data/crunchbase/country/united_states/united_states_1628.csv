In addition, users can easily share Prophet and Outlook information with other applications. 3. Built to leverage Outlook data: Prophet turns existing Outlook data into the building blocks of effective sales management solutions. Every e-mail sent, appointment made, or task created can be viewed, tracked and connected to opportunities.
