During all these years, their need has become their obsession and product: If you cannot be in places where things are happening, or you cannot show your ideas at their best, you will probably be out of the game.   This happens either if you are an entrepreneur who wants to be in the main networks, a worker in your company, or an individual who wants to get closer to your remote family and friends.   They work in a very important side of the problem: to solve not only when peope don't have resources to be physically there, to show themselves and their ideas at their best, despite they are individuals in a family or workers in a big company... but also to accelerate their chances of personal success based on their skills.   To solve this need of ""being there and motivated"", there are already social networks, general metaverses and videoconferencing. Is it not enough? Reality says that it is not enough. Ultimately, when it comes to making decisions, to feel closeness and build trust, they need to feel others as real as possible, in the context of a physical and dynamic space. It is their biological condition to feel the closeness to their colleagues, to feel a ""real working space"" around us.   They have integrated a social network, virtual reality and positional 3D videoconferencing, in as practical and productive way, that it tricks human sensation of spatiality and presence, despite the distance, integrating this experience into their real society based on social network. Also, they work actively on integrating advanced tools for gamification and corporate productivity. They trust that this technological union will deploy an acceleration of ideas and boost productivity of everyone.

Work in their lab seeks to elucidate how the gene and protein networks that regulate cellular growth, division and morphogenesis operate in space and in time, and how different cell shapes and growth patterns can arise from a single genome. They have pioneered the development of 3D image-based high-throughput/high-content microscopy pipelines for yeast-based functional genomics studies. Using that approach, they recently completed the first comprehensive live cell-based screen for microtubule and cell shape regulators and discovered tens of novel candidate regulators - mostly evolutionarily conserved through to humans - which they are validating. Their aim is to generate the most exhaustive genomic map and phenotypic annotation of such regulators, and identify candidate biomedically-relevant targets. Capitalising on this technology, several other microscopy-based functional genomics projects are ongoing in their group. They also recently discovered that the molecular machinery that regulates cell polarity localises to nanoscopic protein clusters at the cell cortex, with different regulators belonging to different cluster populations. This allows cells to control whether certain polarity regulators interact with others on the cortex, at different points of the cell cycle, revealing a fundamental hitherto ignored layer of cell polarity regulation.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",,,5001-10000,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
