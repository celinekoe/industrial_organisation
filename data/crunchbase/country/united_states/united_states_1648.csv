The traditional ""find a distributor"" approach is no longer a valid market entry model, as today's technology becoming more complex and early adapter customers demanding direct vendor leadership and support from start.  Alternatively, hiring one or two local personnel seems to be a better choice, however, being shy of a critical mass formation has its demerits and stress on both the local staff and the customers. Therefore the intended growth strategy is somewhat stimied and the investment not optimized.   Imari Partners offers a hands on representation of an US corporation in the Japanese market, initially staffing the core team with its trans-cultural operational and executive staff members.  As strategic growth plans are formulated, appropriate business structure is implemented, populated with local recruits and partners.  Where necessary, operational funds are sought through local investors.  The result being a cost-effective and market adaptive Japanese business structure that is tailored to the business parameters of the US corporation. Our role is to provide an enterpreneurship foundation during the startup mode, which can then maneuver its own growth path. With our experiences of 6 US startups and 4 turnarounds in the Japanese market, we believe we are the most qualified  to deliver this unique service.
