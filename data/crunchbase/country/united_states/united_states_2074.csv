This autodialer phone system is used both within marketing and sales organizations as well as communities that broadcast emergency messages to its members.  In the 2000's, DSC developed its own line of computer phone systems called the PACER and WIZARD series. These systems combine Intel processors with Dialogic  computer telephony boards and Windows PCs and they are currently marketed throughout the US and Canada. DSC opened several automated (agentless) call centers employing this technology, providing clients with automated phone answering services and voice broadcast programs. Microsoft and Pizza Hut are two of its major clients that actively use this service.  In 2005, DSC introduced CARE (Call Reassurance) which is a telephone reassurance program that calls seniors citizens at home to check on their well-being.  This product is provided to law enforcement organizations and to senior community service groups throughout the U.S. CARE is a significant senior assistance program because it enables the elderly to remain at home for a greater time period in the latter part of life. Seniors, family and friends are provided peace of mind that there is a responsible organization checking in on them every day.  CARE includes not only a senior telephone reassurance capability, but also provides medication reminders for seniors and others who require consistent medication.  CARE likewise is used in communities to check in on latchkey children (kids who arrive home from schoold while their parents are still at work).","Hardware, Information Technology, Internet Services, Messaging and Telecommunications, Software",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
