It was fifty years ago, 1964, that U.S. Air Force Generals Curtis LeMay and Paul Tibbets, with U.S. Army Air Corpsman Bruce Sundlun, partnered to give birth to NetJets’ forerunner, Executive Jet Aviation, one of the world’s first aircraft management businesses. With retired Air Force Brigadier General Dick Lassiter serving as president and chairman of the board – not to mention founding partners such as entertainers James Stewart and Arthur Godfrey – They were in quite capable hands right from the start. And They’ve been pioneers ever since. In 1984, when Richard Santulli purchased EJA and created the NetJets program – and with it, the concept of fractional ownership – They truly cemented Their place in the record books. In the following years, They grew steadily and constantly looked for new ways to ensure They provided the best safety and service for Their Owners: new aircraft, new facilities, new global programs. In 1995, Warren Buffett joined NetJets as a customer; by 1998, he was so impressed with the operation that he bought the company, adding it to the Berkshire Hathaway empire. From then on, with Berkshire’s backing, NetJets has had unmatched resources to invest in whatever it takes to always be the best and safest player in the industry. Today, NetJets continues to uniquely and expertly fill a crucial need – helping Their Owners save time in order to take care of what’s most important in their lives. And as They nurture a nascent operation in China, add state-of-the-art Signature Series™ aircraft worldwide, and take any and all steps to provide the most seamless and enjoyable travel experience possible, you can bet that They will continue to live up to Their promise.","Media and Entertainment, Privacy and Security, Science and Engineering",1,Richard Santulli,5001-10000,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

As proven during the 2008 global financial meltdown, financial institutions have been unable to successfully diversified balance sheet risk and additional new operational inefficiencies have arisen since.  The loss of confidence towards traditional banks, combined with a huge gap between SMEs and financing (especially relevant in developing economies), have created an opportunity to new market incumbents.  Peer‐to‐peer (P2P) lending platforms are disrupting the banking market by facilitating lending to SMEs. This new mode of capital pooling and securitization is currently also being expanded into areas such as invoice trading and real estate investment. On their face, these kinds of investments can provide opportunities for individuals and asset owners and managers to make potentially uncorrelated portfolio allocations. Concurrently, this form of alternative finance allows originators to syndicate balance sheet risk exposures, and risk‐taking SMEs and entrepreneurs, including other FinTech companies, to fund innovation and create jobs. Wupplier is therefore founded under such market conditions, aiming to provide SMEs in developing economies with working capital financing, and to provide investors with an alternative asset class.  In Wupplier we provide our customers with a supplier management tool aiming to improve their financial planning and their relationship with both suppliers and clients, namely we have created a vendor’s portal.  As our clients in our core markets of operations, mainly Mexico, Colombia and Spain (with our first customer originated in the USA), face a big challenge when it comes to finance their daily operations, we believe we can help them close the existing gap with the financial system by providing them access to invoice financing through our marketplace backed by institutional investors.","Financial Services, Payments",1,Gustavo Medina del Rosario,1-10,1,Seed,500000,EUR,538025,500000,EUR,538025,Janto Capital,,1,,Private,,,,,,

They don’t just throw that on as a tag line to seem cool. They live it. Their cardio equipment, weights, yoga studio, and fitness class room is on the first floor because they believe in the full integration of fitness. It’s not on the top story, tucked away in some back corner, isolated from the main area. It’s front and center. They know your training and health requires more than just climbing. They have trainers and staff to help with that wholistic approach to your well being. But that’s only part of the story. They strive for something greater than perfection. If you feel something is perfect, you become complacent, stagnant. Ingenuity is lost. Progress is lost. They strive for something different – they strive for constant improvement. When they open – this will be the best gym you’ve ever seen. And then, they’ll make it better. Not once, but constantly. Incessantly. It’s what drives us. And how will they achieve this? Community. While that is the most used buzzword in their industry, they walk that talk very differently than other gyms. Their community is intentional and visible – in their philosophy on how they hire, treat, and retain employees, in how they designed their space, in how they engage with you the customer, and in how they give back to the outdoor climbing areas surrounding us. If you feel like you belong to your community, you take care of your community. They’ve been doing exactly that for decades. Now they will do it through a climbing gym.
