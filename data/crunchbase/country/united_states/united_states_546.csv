That means advertisers aren’t seeing the results they need, and content creators aren’t seeing the revenue. As an advertiser, you want your products embedded inside the content, instead. Like a Mac being used in a movie or TV show, Whole Foods integrating into a YouTube video, or Nike sponsoring a local event. We understand that you want your brand to enhance what consumers experience, not interrupt it. As a content creator, you want to work with more advertisers to help them reach your audience in useful, fun and authentic ways that are also profitable for you. But you can’t just buy and sell product placements or other sponsorships like you can traditional ads, so we’re building the marketplace to make it possible, online and offline, across all media channels. You could say we’re the match.com of brand integration. Here’s how it works. For content creators who want to work with advertisers, just create a free account on Content BLVD, add your media properties, and list the specific opportunities you want advertisers to see, like product placements, paid reviews or other sponsorships. It’s up to you the kinds of deals you want to sell. Our marketplace helps advertisers find you to get more deals done. For advertisers looking to integrate your products into consumer content, you can filter and browse placement opportunities by channel, reach, demographics and topics. You can follow content creators that could be a good fit for your brand, and message them about opportunities you want to explore. Content BLVD helps you find the brand integrations you need to get in front of the right consumers, in the right place at the right time.

Quests can be anything from chores and exercising to learning and completing homework assignments -- the tasks are endless. You can help your children build good habits and discipline by making quests recurring. You can assign and easily track allowances to quests too, turning your standard chore chart into a fun, engaging game that is great for the whole family. By creating a game around real-life chores and tasks, Joon encourages kids to complete these tasks. This saves parents from nagging and repeatedly asking their kids to do important things like chores, studying, and exercising.

Based in New York, USA, IM academy was formed in 2013 by Christopher and Isis Terry to offer learning and education opportunities to adult students on a subscription model. IM academy’s objective was to provide its customers with accessible and interactive training to enable them to develop skills they could apply to their own trading. Initially IM academy focused on financial markets education but has since expanded its scope into learning modules that cover other areas such as social media and ecommerce. The primary products are learning modules known as academies. There are five distinct learning programs that are offered to customers to purchase via the im.academy website. An additional option is to bundle chosen academies (“Impowered”). The content of each academy is delivered by means of access to unlimited interactive online sessions with IML trainers called “Educators”, via a service which is called “goLive”. Each goLive session is offered in 13 languages on multiple days and at varied times to accommodate students in different time zones. Each session customarily lasts one hour and includes the opportunity for students to ask questions and enter into discussion with the Educator about the subject matter of study. Students can also access a library of pre-recorded video modules for each academy. All pre-recorded content is also available on mobile devices via the IM academy app. Education customers have unlimited online access provided their subscription is current; however, they are free to download pre-recorded and digital content from academies to keep for their later use even after their subscription is cancelled. In addition, IM academy offers TLX, a travel benefits membership programme which is not an educational product but gives members access to discounted travel and experiences including themed educational trips. Product pricing reflects the value and breadth of the content provided to customers. IM academy does not engage in providing trading signals, offer investment advice or provide trading facilities; nor does IM academy refer business to investment brokers or recommend firms of brokers to its academy customers. IM academy therefore has no information on how students actually invest or trade or whether they make a profit or loss in their trading activities. IM academy uses a multi-level marketing programme, involving independent business owners (IBOs) to sell its online educational services. Customers, who are not part of the multi-level structure, pay subscriptions for educational services. Commissions are paid only on customer subscriptions. No commissions are paid for recruitment or from any fees paid by participants in the multi-level programme. All IM academy IBOs are self-employed, independent contractors and not employees; as such they do not receive a salary and are paid only on the customer sales they make, or their sales teams make. IM academy does not accept anyone under the age of 18 as a customer or as an independent business owner. IM academy does not admit minors to its corporate events as attendees and does not allow minors to enroll as customers or IBOs. On enrollment both customers and IBOs are asked to attest that they are over the age of 18 before being able to enroll. Accounts found to be held by minors are terminated. Outside of not permitting minors to enroll, IM academy does not track the age of its customers or IBOs or event attendees. Their company mission includes encouraging personal development in its students and IBO. Positive mindset and self-discipline are characteristics that the founders of IM academy consider to be foundational to both learning and creating a business. Further IM academy has just launched a new academy program called MMX that offers personal development material and education.","Education, Software",2,"Chris Terry, Isis Terry",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Currently it takes dozens of hours for a 3D modeller to fix a photogrammetry model. Lack of 3D rendering that is both easy and cost-effective is a serious showstopper. Trillenium solution bursts through the blockage. Here’s a use case: Consider a typical millennial shopper, she’s considering buying shoes and, of course; she’s going to reach for her phone. Here’s the ideal solution for *BOTH* her and the retailer: Once at a retailer’s site, she picks a shoe and then points her phone at her feet, swiping through shoes, each one actually appearing on her foot, as if she had physically laced one up. (Note: That effect is AR at work.) That interaction so effective that it will add a new verb to retailing vocabulary – to Trill – as in ‘Trill that blouse’ when a retailer wants to show how that item will look on buyer or ‘I trilled pants and bought this pair’ from buyer to friend. A combination of process automation and machine learning to completely remove manual corrections on AR images. Currently it can take from 6-120 hours for a 3d modeller to fix a photogrammetry model. Trillenium’s solution is based on dozens of high-end, professional cameras placed around the product, taking images and uploading them to cloud. Trillenium processes all the information and generates 3d images that are BOTH: highly accurate and lower priced by a factor of 20, so from $200 to $10. Trillenium has two endorsements from iconic fashion retailers. Ted Baker has agreed to install our scanners into their production studio on a 3-month trial period and to pay $10 for each AR image after the trial period. And we also have ASOS, one of the biggest fashion online stores in the world (88 million unique visitors per month). ASOS was so impressed with the potential of Trillenium’s technology they made an investment and took 9 percent of the company.","Commerce and Shopping, Hardware, Software",1,Steve Hrvoje Prpic,1-10,2,,1500197,GBP,2315219,1500197,GBP,2315219,Seedrs,1,1,,Private,,,,,,

Pixar began as the computer graphics project of the Computer Division at Lucasfilm Ltd, created in 1979. The Computer Division was led by Ed Catmull and the graphics project (soon called Pixar) was run by Alvy Ray Smith. Pixar was a hardware company developing highend image processing tools - in particular the Pixar 2D Frame Buffer. In 1984 they hired John Lasseter to help them produce their first animated film, primarily to demonstrate the power of their hardware. Over the years Lasseter created more animated shorts to demonstrate the Pixar, in 1986 creating Luxo Jr. Pixar was spun out of Lucasfilm and was purchased by [Steve Jobs](/person/steve-jobs) in 1986, at which point it became an independent company, although still a hardware company, and run by Ed Catmull and Alvy Ray Smith. Failing to grow the hardware business, they became increasingly dependent on revenue from their animated projects, first doing commercials. Eventually they made a deal with Disney to produce the first full-length feature film entirely in CG. Jobs was not very focused on Pixar, and was trying to sell it in the early 90s. But on the strength of early viewings of Toy Story, he instead took Pixar public. The rest is history. Pixar was acquired by [The Walt Disney Company](/organization/the-walt-disney-company) in 2006, making Jobs the largest shareowner in Disney.","Consumer Electronics, Design, Hardware, Media and Entertainment, Video",3,"Edwin Catmull, George Lucas, Steve Jobs",1001-5000,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
