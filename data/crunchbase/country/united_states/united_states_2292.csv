Users participate through a monthly personal subscription, and can also offset friends and colleague through a comprehensive set of gift options that include a selection of premiums for recipients.  Founded on a set of principles that include a commitment to diversification, innovation driven solutions to climate change, and an emphasis on speed and efficiency for users, the service manages and retires carbon offsets to counter members contribution to global warming via an actively managed portfolio of certified offset projects.  While optimized for accuracy on par with best-of-breed carbon calculators, the Belgrave Trust engine places a strong emphasis on ease of use and speed, achieved via a ""drill-down"" user flow that begins with initial approximations followed by subsequent refinement -- rather than the sequential ""questionnaire"" approach typically beset by multiple roadblocks and high abandonment rates. This robust carbon footprint robust calculator is at the core of the Belgrave Trust value proposition, an order of magnitude increase in speed and efficiency, without a compromise in accuracy. Underlying the engine's architecture are algorithms based on actuarial principles, combined with emission assessments built on the prevailing consensus of the climate science community. The actively managed offset portfolio is diversified by project type and location, and subject to review, with all projects certified by known third-party authorities. The diversified approach allays concerns inherent with single-source, self-sourced, or narrowly-focused voluntary offset services, as allocations shift in real time and adapt quickly to developments in science or policy.  In addition a small portion of the portfolio -- over and above obligations required to offset members --  is directed towards innovation funding to spur experimental technologies and create incentives to bring about paradigm changing solutions.  The Belgrave Trust was created by co-founders Jeffrey Stewart and Nicholas Baily in 2008. A social enterprise, the Belgrave Trust values high level customer service and the power of global markets, and seeks to expand the number of individuals living carbon neutral through the purchase of carbon offsets. The service was introduced March of 2009 as an invitation-only alpha, announced widely with a public beta release November 5, 2009, and exited beta on January 20, 2010.","Internet Services, Natural Resources, Sustainability",2,"Jeff Stewart, Nick Baily",1-10,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,Jason Calacanis,,1,,Private,,,,,,

We have nearly two decades of experience in this space with a recognized staff and substantial audience.     We currently have two verticals running in basketball and football with more verticals planned post funding to expand into baseball, hockey, lifestyle and potentially soccer.     Revenues come from four revenue streams - display ads, premium partnerships, video display revenue and branded content sales, all of which are in place and running.    We are open to discussion on investment structure for the right partner.    Frequently Asked Questions    What Makes Us Different?    Most of the sports content on the web today is one of two flavors – Major Media (ESPN) or fan-driven (Fan Blogs). We are neither. We have the relationships and reach of a major media company but the flexibility to feed the die-hard sports fan in ways that the major media simply doesn’t want to do or the that fan-driven content can’t do. We have deep relationships with players, coaches and executives and we leverage those relationships to tell bigger, deeper and more informed stories than our competition. We also leverage those relationships into exclusive content for the web, mobile and video. In a world of aggregated content, we are truly original content producers and Insiders in sports. That has made us popular among fans, and even more so among brand marketers.    Why Invest With Us?    The current investment landscape is ripe for content producers like us. Recent valuations for like-minded content companies have eclipsed the billion dollar mark. We are building a platform that should draw a sizable valuation once complete and should present many attractive options for early investors either to exit during a future funding round or to be part of a M&A deal down the road.","Advertising, Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment, Mobile, Sales and Marketing, Sports, Video",,,11-50,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
