In the digital age of the twenty-first century, it’s no secret that social media and music streaming are enormous and rapidly growing industries. Paddle is designed like a typical social media platform with the ability to follow other users, like and share posts, and customize a profile, however, rather than posting pictures or captions, Paddle allows users to share songs. Whether it’s one of their favorite songs or a new song they discovered, Paddle offers a convenient platform for friends to share and discover music with each other. People take pride in their music tastes and love sharing the music they discover with their friends. Thanks to music streaming services, exploring music has become easier than ever. The problem is that a convenient, virtual platform for sharing music doesn’t exist. While you can text your friend the link to a song or post a small section of a song on your Instagram story, texting was designed for texting and Instagram was designed for sharing pictures. It seems that a mobile application specifically designed for sharing music will inevitably be created, and when it is, its growth potential will be massive. Our team understands that the time to create an app like Paddle is now and only now. Paddle will collect revenue by displaying ads and offering an enhanced subscription version of the app. The Paddle team is determined to deliver an exceptional platform that shakes the worlds of music and social media.","Apps, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Mobile, Music and Audio, Software",1,Sam Nicholson,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
