Hydrocephalus Association,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/hydrocephalus-association,"Association, Communities, Health Care, Non Profit","Bethesda, Maryland, United States",Hydrocephalus Association is to promote a cure for hydrocephalus and improve the lives of those affected by the condition.,"715,031","Washington DC Metro Area, East Coast, Southern US",$1M to $10M,Active,1983-01-01,year,,,,,Non-profit,http://www.hydroassoc.org,"The Hydrocephalus Association serves as the primary nexus for research on hydrocephalus, a condition defined by an abnormal, excessive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the cavities of the brain. Hydrocephalus affects over 1 million people in the U.S. alone. Approximately 1-2 babies for every 1000 births are born with hydrocephalus, but anyone can get hydrocephalus at any time through a brain injury or infection, among other reasons, or as part of the aging process.  In their effort to find a cure, HA pursues a three-pronged strategy.  COMMUNITY: Hydrocephalus means a lifetime of uncertainty for the families and individuals who are confronted with a diagnosis or who are affected by the condition. Naturally, they want to learn more, to understand what the condition entails, what treatments are available, and they want to know they’re not doing this on their own. They understand this, because many of us have stood in those same shoes. To help, HA gathers together valuable resources and connects individuals to larger communities that can provide support and understanding. By providing an online library and common space for those dealing with hydrocephalus, HA works to reduce uncertainty, advance the overall hydrocephalus community, and provide as much insight as possible into what remains an often challenging and bewildering condition.  CLARITY: Despite its broad prevalence, hydrocephalus remains a misunderstood and often hidden condition, and the general population largely remains unaware of the breadth and depth of the impact of hydrocephalus. This lack of clarity complicates diagnosis, and not surprisingly, it also results in limited funding. For example, while hydrocephalus is 30x more common that Cystic Fibrosis, it receives only 1/13th of the federal research money.  HA works to educate national and state policymakers, the medical community and the general population about the nature and extent of hydrocephalus and to focus attention on the condition and the legislation/attention needed for individuals to overcome challenges.  Their Medical Advisory Board contains leading neurosurgeons, neurologists and other medical professionals and scientists to ensure that they are providing the most current and reliable information. They work to help others see the condition for what it is, so that it can receive the consideration it deserves.  CURE. Today, no cure for hydrocephalus exists, and the primary treatment – the insertion of a shunt into the brain – was developed fifty years ago and suffers from one of the highest failure rates of any surgical treatment. By focusing attention and research monies, HA works toward the ultimate end: a final cure to hydrocephalus. Little is known about the causes of hydrocephalus, but recent research offers hope that a cure is indeed possible. Already they are seeing improved diagnostic techniques. New valve designs are improving the efficacy of the shunts used to treat patients. New treatment options have opened up the possibility of a life without a shunt for some individuals. Studies in biomarkers and genetics are providing promising insights into how they might prevent the condition from occurring. This is the power that research has and every dollar matters. The more research we can fund now, the better the scientific foundation upon which future research will build. HA supports a Strategic Research Initiative that focuses on work that will truly advance our understanding of the condition, and with that, discover its causes, improve its treatment, and help us see an end to hydrocephalus.","Community and Lifestyle, Health Care, Other, Social Impact",,,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Early Econo Heat waste oil fired heaters utilized their patented hydraulic or (high pressure) atomization burners matched with cabinets purchased from Reznor of Mercer, PA. They experienced fair success. Although it required higher preheated oil temperatures resulting in carbonizing and ultimately plugging of the nozzle. Their R & D department felt the system required cleaning too frequently! So, it began designing a system that would allow for a reduction of the oil temperature, which would reduce carbon build up and extend cleaning intervals. With what had been learned from this system, specifically its need to have an exact oil preheat temperature, for adequate atomization of oil spray. Incorporating that heat control technology, and adding air at the nozzle to aid the oil flow spray (atomization), they were able to reduce the oils preheat temperature and the oil pressure.","Energy, Manufacturing, Natural Resources, Science and Engineering",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

MBI also provides technical consultation support to help teams that may need high-level experts to step in and provide technical review of the most critical projects. This allows our clients to get projects off the ground quicker. Almost all staffing companies claim the same differentiators and add value, but MBI truly is a different type of company in terms of the approach we take to ensuring we can meet the customer's very specific needs. The most profound differentiator is that MBI brings a group of highly technical staff to the very first meeting, not salesmen. We bring technical staff who listen to your plans/challenges, and we immediately save time on the search for the right professionals by asking a wide range of pertinent technical questions, and that is really due to the fact that our technical team's introductory visit is more than capable of both understanding the challenges associated to the most complex IT projects, as well as we can offer start up assistance if needed. Bringing the right people to the initial discussion, is hyper critical due to the fact that most IT teams are under intense pressure to deliver against very high expectations, and any steps taken to expedite the delivery of quality professionals is a step in the right direction. Above all, MBI wants any potential customer to sense both simplicity in how to get the process underway, and we want to reflect absolute professionalism in our ability to deliver quality IT resources.","Administrative Services, Information Technology, Professional Services, Software",,,251-500,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Innovative Labs LLC was founded in 2007 by John Webley, a successful businessman with a proven record of accomplishment in the technology industry. The mission of Innovative Labs is to solve environmental challenges that affect global well-being. Innovative Labs focused on a problem and engineered a solution. Webley and his team of engineers and scientists developed a unique Photocatalytic Oxidation (PCO) air purification system and Manganese Oxide (MnOx) air purification system which had been designed to address the concerns of formaldehyde, ozone and VOC pollution. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) challenged scientists to develop air purification technology for trailers supplied by FEMA to house many of the displaced residents of New Orleans.  These trailers were exposing occupants to high levels of formaldehyde and other VOCs’ off-gassing from the composite wood and other materials used in trailer construction. FEMA, NASA, and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducted tests of the Sonoma Air purifier against thirteen (13) other air purification units. The Sonoma Air purifier excelled, yielding a very high single pass conversion of formaldehyde and other VOCs, without emitting ozone.  Innovative Labs is a company driven to solve air quality problems while making a positive impact on society.  Innovative Labs has since taken the technology from the FEMA trailers, and developed air filters to be used in central HVAC systems of hotels, hospitals, businesses and green building construction.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Information Technology, Manufacturing, Science and Engineering",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
