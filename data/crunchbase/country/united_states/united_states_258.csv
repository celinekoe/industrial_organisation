These include the fact that any touch tone phone may be used! The user does not need to have an active data connection and the voice prompt system is very user friendly especially for elderly folks.  Another brilliant feature of RidePIN is that it does a cost comparison for you – listing the fares of multiple ride share operators in real time – giving you a choice of which option is best for you.  With RidePIN therefore, you really can have almost instant access to information on the best price per ride – an advantage when compared to using the apps exclusively designed for Uber or Lyft. RidePIN is linked to your existing Ride Share accounts and the user is charged directly from the corresponding service provider.  RidePIN essentially provides users with a fail-safe and more streamlined service without the need to install any applications.","Hardware, Transportation, Travel and Tourism",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
