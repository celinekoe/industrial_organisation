ConjuChem is currently managing several research programs in-house and has one product in clinical development. They are focused on discovering and developing new drugs based on their novel technology platforms called Drug Affinity Complex (DAC™) and Preformed Conjugate-Drug Affinity Complex (PC-DAC™). When applied to a compound, DAC™ or PC-DAC™ can create a new drug with similar therapeutic activity but a significantly longer duration of activity in the body. One of the greatest opportunities for the DAC™ and PC-DAC™ technology from ConjuChem is its potential to enhance the therapeutic activity of peptides by increasing the half-life and efficacy, while improving tolerability. Specifically, peptides generally have short durations of vivo activity, which significantly limits their potential as commercially viable therapeutic products. The DAC™ and PC-DAC™ technology platforms have broad applicability in several targeted indications. They believe there are many attractive potential targets for the constructs being built from these technology platforms.

The Uihlein family traces its roots back to southern Germany. In the mid-1800’s several family members immigrated to the U.S. and were an instrumental part of a substantial brewery. In 1962 Henry Uihlein, founded U-Line Corporation as an outgrowth of Ben-Hur Freezer Company and was the first to develop and patent an automatic stand-alone undercounter residential ice maker. His foresight and determination to develop new ideas and to succeed when there were no clear guidelines or solutions are evident today. The newest Uihlein generation continues to build upon the family’s innovative legacy at the Milwaukee, Wisconsin based business by providing continuity and vision from which new designs and technology continue to be born. U-Line has captivated those with an appreciation for the finer things with exceptional functionality, style, inspired innovations and attention to even the smallest details. They are known and respected for their unwavering dedication to product design, quality and selection. Corporate headquarters have been based in Milwaukee since 1962 and a West Coast office was established in Laguna Beach, California in 2006. U-Line has shipped product to five continents for over two decades. The opening of a European office marks U-Line’s ongoing commitment to its continued growth and expansion as it becomes firmly established in the global marketplace.

After working with this podcast for more than 4 years, Dan realized that he had developed a truly unique understanding of religion which he had a responsibility to share. Thus, BRIDE Ministries was founded in 2016, then titled the Fire Place Church. Since beginning, the church has expanded exponentially. BRIDE Ministries takes a number of approaches that few other religious institutions take. The church founded an Online Bible Study, as well as offering coaching and scholarships to many of it's congregants.

Located on East 59th Street, the Humane Society of New York operates an animal hospital and the Vladimir Horowitz and Wanda Toscanini Horowitz Adoption Center, which together help in excess of 38,000 dogs and cats each year. There are hundreds of animals with unique needs at the facility on any given day.     Prioritizing animal quality of life both from a physical and emotional perspective, HSNY staff make sure every dog gets sufficient exercise and outdoor time, while cats are allowed daily play sessions when not in their kennels. The hospital's veterinary staff take great care with each animal when providing a range of basic wellness services in addition to performing advanced diagnostic and surgical procedures.    The Humane Society of New York's clinic care services include wellness exams, inoculations, blood tests, ultrasound, and endoscopy. It provides these and other services at affordable rates to dog and cat owners with limited means and, in some cases, covers complete veterinary costs through its Animal Emergency Appeal.     In regard to its adoption services, HSNY microchips and neuters all animals. Dogs are trained under the guidance of Bill Berloni, an acclaimed animal behaviorist who also serves as the Society's director of dog training. Moreover, those interested in adopting are carefully screened to ensure the animal is going to a safe and loving home.    The Humane Society of New York is a recipient of America's Best Charities Seal of Excellence. Only 5 percent of charities in the United States meet the award's strict standards in areas such as public accountability, cost effectiveness, and program efficiency.
