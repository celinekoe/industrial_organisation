Seams Karmic offers busy moms a simple way to shop, sell, and donate high quality, practically new kids' clothes online. Our professionally hand-picked selections grow weekly, giving moms an opportunity to find new 'gems' each week that fit their budget and their little one's growing bodies. Cleaning out and earning cash on the kid's outgrown clothes is incredibly easy and free with our selling concierge service. Moms can cash out or apply store credit to upgrade their children's wardrobe.  We have partnered with kid centric nonprofit organizations such as the Raleigh based, Note in the Pocket, to offer a unique donation service called NICE SEAMS! This service, which is the number one choice of Seams Karmic selling members, is an optional program where we offer to donate on behalf of our members, any item we cannot buy. We then return to the member the donation receipt (and good karma). We provide moms and their families the ability to shop for name brand kid's clothes at a fraction of the retail cost, allowing them to continually update clothes for their children without sacrificing style and quality for savings. A goal of the company is to make consignment, re-purposing, and donations of kid's clothing an exciting, enjoyable, and time saving experience that can happen any time of the day and from anywhere. Our belief is that consignment doesn't have to be viewed as buying or selling used clothes, but rather an incredible way to shop fresh styles that have been barely worn, save our environment by keeping clothes and fabrics out of landfills, and make contributions to communities of children who depend on the kindness of others to determine if they'll have clothes to wear to school from day to day.","Clothing and Apparel, Design",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Our frustration got us thinking about a solution that would give small businesses not only a great website, but a full web marketing solution...and without breaking the bank.  Instead of just going around complaining about it, we set out to find a solution. Our research proved to us that we can deliver affordable custom designed websites and still include useful features like a content management system and marketing tools. That's when we got really excited. Our Big Breakthrough! Most affordable website solutions are useless. The designs are awful, are not optimized for search engines and very rarely produced any results. Our big breakthrough moment was when we realized that if we built an application to manage the complicated development process, and harness the talent of all the independent web designers, we could reduce the time and cost of delivering a GREAT website. After several months of prototyping and researching technologies and options we came up with a solution - we call it Web-o-Matic!
