With these factors in mind, the innovators at MVSC designed an unrivaled product that not only covered all registration and compliance requirements, but one that provided top quality customer service and support. MVSC leaders gathered a team of top registration, compliance, and DMV experts to share their knowledge and expertise. After two years of intense development, the first version of the flagship product, DMVdesk, was released and tested. In what is seen as an evolutionary process, DMVdesk began its early days trying to conquer the nation’s largest market: California. It has since grown to be the state’s largest provider. MVSC heard the market’s call and set out to meet its needs. The market responded by making DMVdesk the leading DMV electronic vehicle registration compliance solution in the state of California, with MVSC established as the recognized leader in the eGovernment process management field.","Internet Services, Software, Transportation",2,"Don Armstrong, Kelly Kimball",101-250,1,Private Equity,,USD,,,USD,,Accel-KKR,,1,,Private,,,,,,

As ESPN is a cable network for pro and college sports, MYSN reaches the youth sports community – millions of players, parents and coaches. Instead of cable TV, we use mobile phones and tablets as our network.     The youth sports community is a coveted demographic among advertisers: moms, dads, kids and teens. MYSN instantly connects with them all.    Because of their busy lives this is a very difficult demo to engage. MYSN solves this problem by becoming part of their daily routine.    Whether it be at home, waiting in a car, checking game schedules, planning snacks, getting practice times, news about weather delays, league standings, or individual statistics: MYSN delivers all this information in one easy-to-use mobile app, promoted through our exclusive relationships with the leagues and clubs to which they belong.     MYSN currently serves over 300 youth leagues and clubs, comprised of more than 155,000 players, 30,000 team administrators, 200,000 parents.      KEY BUSINESS METRICS    1) Very Low Acquisition Cost per User:   Youth sports are highly organized: Teams belong to clubs, which belong to leagues, or state associations. This structure enables us to reach thousands of coaches, players and parents in single announcements.    2) Excellent Recurring Revenue:   Advertisers come from a broad range of products & services, and each user has a multi-year life cycle.    RECENT PRESS  Last month MYSN was named the exclusive mobile service provider for CalNorth – an enormous state association: they have about 200,000 players and coaches. More announcements to come soon.      TODAY  We now have rapidly developing initiatives on the East Coast, in Southern CA, and the Midwest.   Pilot projects are underway of a version for High Schools.     MYSN is building the largest mobile platform to engage the highly desirable """"active family"""" demographic. Come join us !

Tired of insurance companies and various insurance plans dictating patient care, these doctors, practicing in the early 1980’s, helped usher in a new era of medicine in Oklahoma by accepting Pacificare HMO plans - the first such plans accepted in the state. HMO plans, which utilize a primary care provider for each patient as well as a network of specialists, put the physician and the patient back in control of their health care while lowering costs. During this time, current president of the Oklahoma City Clinic, Dr. John M. Bell, a graduate of the OU College of Medicine, was completing his residency at Scott and White Memorial Hospital in Temple, Texas. While there, Dr. Bell witnessed Scott and White’s industry-leading, patient-focused system of care, which utilized HMOs.  These two sequences of events paved the way for Dr. Bell and his colleagues to found GlobalHealth in 2003, emphasizing patient-focused care with a low monthly cost, without sacrificing high quality. GlobalHealth is an Oklahoma-based health maintenance organization for Oklahoma’s state and federal government employees, including educators, and is a cost-effective option for employers seeking to offer comprehensive health care benefits to their employees. GlobalHealth also offers specialized services and products, including those for seniors and retired government employees, as well as an array of pharmaceutical offerings designed to help members maintain their health with both quality and convenient prescription drug benefits.",Health Care,,,51-100,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
