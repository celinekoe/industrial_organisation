These efforts were driven by a need conveyed by customers, overwhelmed with the task of managing paper and its workflow within their industries. The results of that endeavor spawned “PaperSolve” (both the product and company). Today, thousands of users have PaperSolve, or one of its custom-built modules under the covers, providing document imaging technology and workflow.
