The Barnes Foundation’s Art and Aesthetics programs engage a diverse array of audiences. These programs, occurring at the Philadelphia campus, online, and in Philadelphia communities, advance the mission through progressive, experimental and interdisciplinary teaching and learning.  The Barnes Arboretum, located at the Merion campus, contains more than 2,000 species/varieties of trees and woody plants, many of them rare. Founded in the 1880s by Joseph Lapsley Wilson and subsequently added to under the direction of Mrs. Laura L. Barnes, the collection includes a fern-leaf beech (Fagus sylvatica ‘Laciniata’), a dove tree (Davidia involucrata), a monkey-puzzle tree (Araucaria araucana), and a redwood (Sequoia sempervirens).  Other important plant collections include Lilacs, Peonies, Stewartias and Magnolias. The Horticulture school at the Barnes Foundation in Merion has offered a comprehensive, three year certificate course of study in the botanical sciences, horticultural practices, garden aesthetics, and design through a well-grounded, scientific learning experience since its inception in 1940 by Mrs. Barnes.",Education,1,Albert C.

In West Bengal, for example, absence of development initiatives and industrial growth, coupled with saline soil, rising sea levels and annual cyclones result in limited livelihood opportunities for marginalized people in primarily agrarian communities. <BR/> In the most undeserved areas of the country where Anudip works, geographic remoteness has resulted in a level of education that does not lead to employment. A needs assessment study (mentioned above) performed in 2005 determined that the local level of education has not transcended the gap in abilities cause by economic adversity, geographic isolation, governmental negligence and dearth of livelihood opportunities other than subsistence work. Anudip Foundation tailors its training programs to offer real options to the indigent, low income communities it serves. Anudip teaches much desired skills through computer and entrepreneurship courses and market-aligned placement mentoring programs. <BR/> Anudip offers three livelihood options for graduates who have completed their courses in its training centers, called Linkage Centers. These are: placement in mainstream jobs, entrepreneurship, or employment directly in Anudip`s own project outsourcing centers, called MERIT Centers (Mass Employment Through Rural IT). Anudip`s Entrepreneurship Development Program allows graduates interested in IT-based micro-business to get started on the path to profitability.

Designed and built by veterans of the industry, MCAtrack is a multi-tiered platform that can be accessed and operated from any computer without having to download any software or maintain any servers. Utilizing a multi-tiered model, the platform allows for access by Funders, Syndicators, ISOs, Reps, and Merchants while compartmentalizing each deal so that information is limited to those specific users. Unlike the majority of systems out there, you can create an unlimited number of users at no additional cost. The platform was designed using a Flat UI design concept which focuses on offering as much information in a simple and concise format, rather than creating visual clutter that will overwhelm the user; the focus is on content and functionality in a presentation format (think GoogleNow or iOS7). But don’t let the simple user interface fool you, it’s a sophisticated system that can actively track merchant payments, batches, splits, and ACH debits/credits in real time. Now, once you see the demo, you’ll like it and the wheels will begin to turn and you’ll fantasize about creating your own multi-faceted platform, but unfortunately this is a prevalent pattern within the industry, where companies get amped at the thought of a do-it-yourself project and consider the possibility of building their own system or at the very least buying some out of the box solution hoping that they can customize it to fit their needs.  Speaking from experience, we know it doesn’t work. Ever.  And it’s just the kind of money-pit that will set your business back 50k before you realize you should have stuck with a full service solution that was built from the ground up. With in-depth reporting, the system offers the user the ability to utilize specific portfolio information that wouldn’t otherwise be available, including: Merchant Payment Reports, Syndicator Earnings reports, as well as the ability to email Commission Statements and Funding Statements through the platform’s backend. Those are the perks of using a full service solution. But the most important thing the system offers its users is time; by eliminating the need for multiple excel sheets, manual data entry, and complex formulas, the system frees you up so you can spend more time pursuing leads and closing deals.","Financial Services, Information Technology, Sales and Marketing, Software",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
