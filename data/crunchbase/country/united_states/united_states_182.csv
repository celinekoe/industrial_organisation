From the beginning, EFF has championed the public interest in every critical battle affecting digital rights. Blending the expertise of lawyers, policy analysts, activists, and technologists, EFF achieves significant victories on behalf of consumers and the general public. EFF fights for freedom primarily in the courts, bringing and defending lawsuits even when that means taking on the US government or large corporations. By mobilizing more than 140,000 concerned citizens through our Action Center, EFF beats back bad legislation. In addition to advising policymakers, EFF educates the press and public. EFF is a donor-funded nonprofit and depends on your support to continue successfully defending your digital rights.

The fund’s first investment will be in SetPoint Medical, a California company considered a trailblazer in creating implantable devices to treat inflammatory diseases. The fund complements the work of GSK’s Bioelectronics R&D unit, which was established in 2012 after a two-year effort to seek out and engage the most promising researchers in this emerging area of science.  The name of the fund comes from electrical signals called action potentials that pass along the nerves in the body. Irregular or altered patterns of these impulses may occur in association with a broad range of diseases.  GSK believes that miniaturised devices, or bioelectronic medicines, can be designed to read these patterns. The devices could be designed to interface between the peripheral nervous system and specific organs to read, change or generate electronic impulses that help treat disorders as diverse as inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatoid arthritis; respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD and metabolic diseases including Type 2 diabetes. The field of bioelectronic medicines is in its very early stages. GSK’s ambition, through collaboration with scientists globally, is to have the first medicine that speaks the electrical language of our body ready for approval by the end of this decade.“We want to help create the medicines of the future and be the catalyst for this work,” said Moncef Slaoui, chairman of R&D and architect of GSK’s early stage investment strategy. “GSK can play the integrating role that is needed to drive this new type of medical treatment all the way from the bench to the patient and this fund is a key part of our efforts.” Action Potential Venture Capital intends to build a portfolio of five to seven companies over the next five years. The fund will focus investments in three areas: - New start-up companies that aim to pursue the vision of bioelectronic medicines - Existing companies with technologies that are interacting with the peripheral nervous system  through first-generation devices that can stimulate or block electrical impulses - Companies advancing technology platforms that will underpin these treatment modalities Action Potential Venture Capital will be based in Cambridge, Massachusetts and managed by a small, dedicated team. The fund has named Imran Eba as its first partner. Imran will move from GSK’s Worldwide Business Development organisation and work closely with the Bioelectronics R&D unit.","Financial Services, Lending and Investments",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Since then, Doc Johnson has developed and released some of the most groundbreakingproducts on the market, creating the original Pocket Rocket-- a name that became so famous it remains synonymous with the type of small external-use vibes tucked into every woman's nightstand-- and the Rabbit-style vibes that changed the way America talks about sex toys and female pleasure.Doc Johnson continues to raise the bar each year with award-winning innovations like the TRYST™ Multi Erogenous Silicone Massager and the OptiMALE™ Rechargeable Vibrating C-Ring. Today, Doc Johnson still manufactures more than 75% of their products in America,  producing many of the highest-quality and most well-designed products on the market. Driven by the principle that sexual exploration of oneself and among consenting adults is a healthy and necessary part of the human experience, each product produced under the Doc Johnson banner is created to cater to a number of interests and identities. Their Vac-U-Lock™ system, a collection that continually expands to serve many functions, fantasies, and practices, is the end result of that commitment. This patented harness and plug system revolutionized strap-on play, offering fully adjustable harnesses built for comfort and superior control coupled with a proprietary plug designed to hold insertable toys perfectly in position and allow for endless custom options.

Most likely your business is going to bring your products and services to your customers doorstep. However, straight away you’re faced with a complex problem… should you develop an expensive software solution or, do you use what’s on the shelf and put the extra time and resources into growing your core business idea? Unfortunately, what’s on the shelf won’t give you a competitive advantage against the larger companies that have hand built their own solution. Without a custom solution you simply won’t be efficient enough to survive in the long term. This is where fieldd comes in! Fieldd powers your mobile services that travel to your customer’s home or work, and does so in a way that gives your customers the impression that you have hand built your own custom solution. Fieldd is different to other platforms because fieldd focuses on automating and prioritizing the customer experience. From the moment your customers book your services online, they are guided through a unique customer experience to turn them into a customer for life. Other platforms simply hold your customers’ details and often are no better than an address book. This unique “loop” to keep your customers engaged isn’t possible on other platforms and companies are forced to use a range of solutions to get the job done. Why hasn’t this been done before? Put simply, building fieldd has been a hard process! After 3 years of initial R&D & 30,000+ live R&D bookings, fieldd was launched in 2019 and now is the software of choice in 15 countries across 20 different industries. 15 years ago the thought of McDonald’s delivering your food was a futuristic thought. Today with the latest technology, UberEats has made this idea an everyday solution. 15 years ago the thought of catching a taxi was also not an everyday solution due to the inconvenience of booking, tracking & paying for your taxi. Yet today, technology has pushed taxis to become an everyday solution. The demand for customer convenience has always been on the rise and with COVID, this need has been supercharged even further. 100% of the time customers will instantly book the best priced, fastest service provider to come to them. Yet 98% of businesses rely on a 15 year old quote request form with a 1-5 day reply time. Before Uber entered the taxi & food industry, these two industries represented industries that were waiting to be optimized with technology. The amount of other service industries that are currently highly inconvenient and can be optimized, is practically endless. Prior to fieldd, the automation and customization within fieldd that are included with every plan, were only possible with custom software development. Now, it’s possible with a click of a button. Every day we are unlocking hidden potential in field service businesses globally, we look forward to seeing your business do the same.","Apps, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Commerce and Shopping, Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Mobile, Platforms, Sales and Marketing, Science and Engineering, Software",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The company is licensed in 48 states. Located in Orange, CA, there is also an additional retail office in Kennesaw Georgia as well as the wholesale division located in Scottsdale Arizona.  The company was founded in 2004 by Reza Jahangiri. Now President and CEO, Jahangiri has expanded the company exponentially in the past decade with offerings beyond reverse mortgages.   CEO Jahangiri is also a founding board member in the Coalition of Independent Seniors (CIS) and served as CEO of several healthcare providers prior to his work with American Advisors Group.  His background in the industry has led to his success with AAG.  In 2014, Jahangiri was announced as a semi-finalist for the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award. Since 2010, the company has grown from just 60 employees to more than 750. Of those new additions, more than 200 workers joined between 2012 and 2013.  AAG Reverse Mortgage has recently acquired two companies to further add to its expansion:  Reverse Mortgage USA, a smaller reverse mortgage company, as well as Associated Mortgage Banker’s Reverse Division.  American Advisors Group provides home equity conversion mortgage (HECM) loans and has 81 HUD approved areas of business. Today, the company is ranked among the top reverse mortgage lenders in the country and has been the #1 lender for HECM Retail since July 2013. The AAG Reverse Mortgage team differs from others in the market due to their unique internal structure. The company operates on a direct-to-consumer, centralized model. Management and staff is all under one roof, which keeps the business agile and allows for spur-of-the-moment training in spite of the company’s large size.   AAG offers substantial benefits to company employees including a 401K matching program and work-life balance policies.  New Loan Officers go through a rigorous 6 week paid training program and are guided by the AAG Training Department team.  Countless “AAG University” online courses are also available to all employees.  In 2010, former senator Fred Thompson signed on as the spokesperson for American Advisors Group. Having seen numerous commercials and television advertisements featuring the politician, many Americans today associate his face with the reverse mortgage industry.  Prior to Fred Thompson, American Advisors Group was represented by actor Peter Graves. In 2009, he served as the face of the company in a comprehensive marketing campaign touting the benefits of reverse mortgages for seniors. Aside from reverse mortgages, AAG participates in the non-profit space. In 2011, Jahangiri created the “AAG Gives Back Committee” to contribute to charitable organizations around the globe. Though initially AAG was dedicated solely to the Kwagala Project, they have since expanded to domestic charities including Alzheimer’s Association, Harvest Food Bank, Families Forward, and Friends & Helpers.   The company is very active in fundraising events, sponsoring several fun activities for employee participation to encourage donations.  Most recently, AAG held a company-wide Spelling Bee, sparking employees’ competitive natures and thus raising over $1100 dollars for low-income-seniors, which is the highest fundraising amount to date. In 2012, AAG’s CEO Reza Jahangiri took over The Reverse Review, a magazine devoted to the reverse mortgage market. This acquisition allows for a seamless exchange of industry information and increases the availability and quality of home equity conversion mortgage loan products.  For Americans with questions about how to obtain an AAG reverse mortgage, The Reverse Review is one of the leading sources informational materials. The company’s mission states that employees should strive to make the reverse mortgage experience as informative and efficient as possible, in order to serve the senior community with the highest level of satisfaction.  In September 2012, AAG’s dedicated sales team and management were rewarded for their efforts. Reverse Mortgage Daily awarded American Advisors Group three industry awards: 1. Best Retail Brand  2. Best Lead Provider  3. Best Celebrity Spokesperson The RMD Awards are based on more than 45,000 votes from contributors across various sectors of the reverse mortgage industry. Since then, the company has only continued to grow and accumulate positive press. In 2014, the AAG Digital Marketing department completed an overhaul of the company’s entire website, taking into consideration opinions and comments of their senior demographic and making the new site easier to navigate as well as more aesthetically pleasing.  The first consumer newsletter, The Monthly Line, was also launched, containing a variety of content from heartwarming borrower stories to entertaining puzzles, in order to appeal to its target audience. American Advisors Group is accredited by the Better Business Bureau and has ranked as one of the Top Workplace in Orange, CA by the Orange County Register four years in a row.  In addition, AAG continues to maintain a 97% Customer Satisfaction Rating in customer surveys.  The company is also an active member in the National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association (NRMLA).  Also, AAG is one of the finalists for the ACG Awards for Corporate Growth, which is an award that honors a local company that demonstrates growth in employment, profitability, charity and sales.","Community and Lifestyle, Financial Services, Other, Real Estate",1,Reza Jahangiri,501-1000,1,,4000000,USD,4000000,4000000,USD,4000000,JAM Equity Partners,1,1,,Private,,,,,,

We’re the world’s first content incubator. Gramarye Media is the cross-media entertainment studio of the future, the first on the east coast — discovering, incubating, vetting, producing, and distributing original content, including books, films, games, AR and VR, merchandise, and more. We’re disrupting the Hollywood studio model. With budgets soaring, original content is risky because it lacks brand awareness. Meanwhile, analysts and executives agree: the cycle of sequels and remakes is presenting increasing danger to industry profitability. In addition, there is tremendous waste built into the Hollywood system.  Executives and analysts agree: Hollywood spends at least twice what it should making films. Gramarye has recognized that these issues provide an opportunity for disruption. Our process is based on three core concepts: 1.	Reduce Risk — Discover original content with a built-in, proven audience 2.	Produce Content at a Significantly Lower Cost for multiple cross-media channels in concert to open new opportunities for revenue generation  3.	Own access to Distribution Channels All three pillars will generate revenue. Blockchain Technology Gramarye makes disruptive use of blockchain technology in two ways:  •	First, Gramarye’s SEC-Compliant ICO raise makes us the first major studio funded by a cryptocurrency offer. It’s not just a Gramarye raise — we’re investing in a complete ecosystem of partner companies, each of which expand our capabilities and return dividends to token holders. Second, Gramarye uses blockchain utility tokens (which cannot be purchased) to provide meaningful rewards and incentives to fan evangelists who spark the viral spread of brand awareness, and to stream content directly to consumers hungry for the core, generational stories that unite us all.
