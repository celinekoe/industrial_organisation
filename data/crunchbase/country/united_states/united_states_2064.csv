Britehorn Partners,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lohi-merchant-bank,Financial Services,"Denver, Colorado, United States",Britehorn Partners is a Denver based Investment bank that specializes in Mergers and Acquisitions and Advisory for middle market companies.,"788,173","Greater Denver Area, Western US",,Active,2012-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,http://www.britehorn.com,"Britehorn Partners takes a hands-on approach to building valuable businesses. We believe that active involvement with a client throughout the growth cycle is a key to success — and we work closely with management teams to develop and execute strategy, open doors to capital and strategic relationships, and ultimately create meaningful exits. Merger & Acquisition Expertise Drawing on our team’s collective experience, LoHi is active across the full range of M&A advisory: Sell-Side Advisory LoHi specializes in selling middle market companies – with a primary focus in the telecom, media, technology and business services verticals. We excel at finding the highest quality buyers for the companies with whom we work. Contemplating the sale of a business can be complicated, daunting and fraught with misinformation. We simplify and streamline the process by offering management independent and unbiased advice. Once the decision to sell has been made, we run a highly professional and efficient process staffed by senior investment bankers with decades of experience. And when it comes time to select the right buyer, we are there every step of the way to evaluate the merits of each offer and shepherd the transaction through diligence and a successful closing. Too often M&A advisors try to force a seller into one type of transaction that may benefit the advisor, but may not meet the short and long-term objectives of the seller. We take the opposite approach and start our process with a comprehensive understanding of a seller’s objectives – including business culture, valuation, structure, and desire for future involvement – and then run a focused process on the basis of meeting those goals. Buy-Side Advisory Similar to our sell-side practice, LoHi works with corporations and private equity groups seeking acquisition opportunities. We have a strong track record of successful buy-side engagements in relation to public or private targets, and are able to advise interested buyers on attractive acquisition candidates through our global network of relationships. Distressed M&A LoHi frequently combines the experience of its M&A and restructuring professionals to advise buyers and sellers of distressed businesses/assets. We look to identify creative tactical or strategic solutions to unlock value in every situation. We recognize that executing M&A in distressed situations requires incremental skills that are not always required in traditional M&A deals. Some of these skills include working with a highly levered acquirer or target, navigating the bankruptcy process, performing a valuation that can withstand court and shareholder scrutiny and managing inherent conflicts of interest among different constituencies. Corporate Finance and Strategic Advisory LoHi advises companies, financial institutions and governments on a wide variety of operational, restructuring and financing situations. We offer expert advice and extensive transactional experience unconflicted by trading or research activities. Our team has executed pre-emptive recapitalizations, private offerings, debt restructurings, and a range of other advisory services for a diverse client base. By working with clients to reach consensus, LoHi has had great success brokering both straight-forward transactions as well as more complex transactions with divisive inter-creditor and shareholder issues. Capital Raising LoHi advises companies on their most critical financing decisions, including offerings of equity, debt and non-traditional funding alternatives. LoHi brings extensive experience negotiating and structuring tailored solutions for our clients with no conflicts from other business activities or product offerings to influence our advice. International Partnerships LoHi has dedicated partners based in London, Toronto and Shanghai. Combining our international footprint with our independence, experience and industry knowledge, we are capable of serving international clients and executing cross-border transactions.",Financial Services,2,"Bobbi Babitz, Brett Story",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
