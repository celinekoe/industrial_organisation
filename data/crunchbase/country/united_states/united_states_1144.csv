(STI) was established as an Idaho corporation in 1997.  STI was originally established as an information technology consulting company specializing in designing and building custom software systems.  Over the proceeding 8 years they were dedicated to that objective, successfully building software solutions for a wide range of business applications and companies, from local to multi-national, and commercial use. In 1999, through community involvement, STI’s founder was asked to help a local non-profit Independent Living Center (ILC) start a Medicaid ‘Consumer Directed’ Personal Care Services (PCS) business.  Their PCS business quickly outgrew their ability to manage it and in 2001 STI’s founder was elected to their board of directors for the  specific task of ‘fixing’ their PCS administrative process.  In 2001, after an unsuccessful search for a good commercial PCS software system, STI began developing a custom system specifically designed to meet the needs of a Medicaid PCS business.  Over time the system grew and evolved into what is now known as Home Health Services Manager © (HHSM). In 2002, and over the next couple of years, other ILC companies were making inquiries about using their Medicaid PCS system.  By 2004, the reputation of their Medicaid PCS system had grown into a customer base of ILC companies across 5 states.  Their system, Home Health Services Manager had grown up – it had become a commercial application. In 2005 two important decisions were made that solidify their commitment:   #1:  As a company, will pursue only activities that relate to their system, Home Health Services Manager, its customers, and the in-home personal care services industry.   #2:  Their customer base/users of HHSM will no longer be limited to ‘non-profit’ ILC companies.  They are dedicated to ‘for profit’ and 'non-profit' companies equally. Currently, their customer base of HHSM users is about 50/50 between non-profit ILC companies and for-profit personal care services businesses.  They have stayed true to their commitments and remain completely dedicated to the in-home personal care services industry.  Since 2005, their growth has averaged approximately 80% annually.  They have earned a reputation for both excellent customer service and an excellent software system. Their mission statement is their guide.  ‘They exist to provide their customers the best product, process, and service – a partnership that gives them maximum value from their in-home personal care services business.’","Information Technology, Professional Services, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Start pregaming your next party, trip or night out with friends now, to enjoy the future in the present. Slap is more useful than a group chat, but more fun than a calendar. -- Half the fun of doing something is the anticipation of doing it, but who likes to make plans? It can be such a hacked together hassle across too many apps, so we decided to fix that. We've turned the map into a video-based social calendar with group chat that captures future plans with a collaborative ""group event story""™ consisting of a Video Invite® + Video RSVPs. Imagine a fun video walkie talkie-like experience. There are plenty of invite services that ‘list’ who’s coming to your party or event but none of them ‘show you’ who’s coming and how excited they are to join in. Have a good time between the good times with Slap. Watch the hype and momentum build for what you and your friends are looking forward to doing. ****************** How to use Slap? ****************** Slap: Bored? Record a Slap (Video Invite®) to start a ""group event story""™ telling your friends or the world what you want to do. Personalize them with Lenses powered by Snap AR. Then pin the location of where you’ll be and when on your map. Explore: Looking for something to do? Surf the Slap Map to see what your friends have posted they’ll be doing. Don't miss out, event stories disappear 24 hours after the fun starts in real life. Slap back: Find something interesting to do? Slap back by recording a Video RSVP to tell your friends you’re in. Start enjoying the anticipation as the Slaps start coming in and you see how psyched everyone is. Messaging: Once you Slap back that you'll be joining in, you'll unlock the group event chat with everyone else who will be going to what's being planned before, during and after the event. **************** When all of your favorite people are sharing and discovering things for you to join in on, life will get a lot more interesting and memorable. That’s our vision and we appreciate you helping to spread the word with your closest friends. We’ve worked hard to bring you Slap and we're having a lot of fun doing it. We would love to hear what you like, don’t like or want to see in the future. Thanks in advance for letting us know at: helpme@slap.events.
