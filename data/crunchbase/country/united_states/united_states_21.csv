Restaurants that sign on with The Restaurant List Company are able to reach customers who are making an immediate decision about where to eat.  The List gives these hotel guests specific restaurant choices near the hotel and a map showing how to get there.   ""With The List, a hotel can provide its guests with a choice of over 30 restaurants, in all dining categories and prices,"" said Marc Fortune, co-founder of The Restaurant List Company.  ""And they have a professionally printed document with a map on the back to show where each restaurant is in proximity to the hotel, as well as local attractions.""  Investors have also seen the wisdom of the simple business put together by Fortune and Gould as the Restaurant List Company has raised $1.6 million in startup capital.  The investment was led by Solidus Company with participation from Nashville Capital Network angels, the NCN Angel Fund, and a number of individual Nashville and Atlanta investors.   Speaking for Solidus, Managing Partner Townes Duncan said, ""The Restaurant List Company is the perfect type of investment for Solidus Partners.  It is simple to understand, it is built for the long-term, and the principals have proven in past ventures that they know how to build value.  We are excited about the company's growth potential over the next few years.""   Sid Chambless, executive director of Nashville Capital Network, commented on the investment in The Restaurant List Company: ""Nashville Capital Network has a long standing relationship with the management team of The Restaurant List Company.  Because of their track record and the promise of this opportunity, NCN's fund joined several of our angel group members in helping capitalize the company.""   Gould and Fortune are currently launching their product in the Nashville area and are planning to be in at least five Southeast markets by the end of 2009.

A user chooses four areas of interest called pillars.  Examples of these include things like: travel, working out, faith/spirituality and nightlife.  Then a user updates each of their pillars with activities that are specific to that pillar.  For example, one of the events in the working out pillar is simply, ""I worked out.""  Each event has a date associated so that these events become a timeline view of how someone is in real life.   The search experience relies on matching people who have at least one pillar in common.  In this way there is some smart matching between people, but nothing that would require extensive personality questionnaires.","Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Mobile",1,Rory O'Rourke,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
