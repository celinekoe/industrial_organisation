Melvin G. McInnis, M.D., the Principal Investigator of the Prechter Research Projects, and a leading scholar in bipolar genetics, was recruited to the University by Dr. Greden after serving 15 years on the faculty at Johns Hopkins University. His initial study of bipolar families became one of the first modern genetic linkage studies in bipolar disorder. The Prechter Fund is currently supporting major research projects. Based at the U-M Depression Center, these projects incorporate collaborations with researchers at Weill Cornell, Stanford, Johns Hopkins and Penn State Universities.

Reardon, has been involved in making real-estate better since 1986 when he began learning the trade of framing houses and installing drywall. A decade later, in 1995-1998, he teamed up with Regal Homes in Albuquerque, NM and built custom Spanish style homes in the foothills of the Sandia Mountains and west petro cliffs before coming to California. Regal Homes was a great opportunity to learn all facets of custom home construction. Bud Regal was a well seasoned builder with almost 40 years of general construction knowledge who took Paul under his wing and taught him everything about building a house from the ground up. In 1998 Paul moved to California looking to get a piece of the real-estate boom and took a job with ERI one of the premier environmental remediation companies, who at that time were involved in retrofitting gas stations for Tosco (76 Oil) and Exxon/Mobil. This was part of an endowment program mandated by the President to change steel under ground storage tanks (UST’s), into double wall fiberglass UST’s, as a prevention from leaking fuel into ground water tables. The environmental clean up business was a great opportunity to see the commercial side of construction and learn many trades like concrete finishing, soil engineering, pipe fitting, soldering, welding, heavy equipment and commercial development.  For the next several years Paul spent most of his time working in general construction and going to school to learn real estate law and economics and then in 2004 he started working with Safeguard Real Estate Investments and quickly became their No. 1 real-estate investment consultant and was promoted to Director of Business Development.","Other, Real Estate",1,Paul Reardon,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
