The resulting solutions improve performance and features while reducing system level power, area, pin count and economics. The massive increase in number of users, amount of data per user and more complex, real-time bandwidth-intensive services, such as video-on-demand, Internet protocol TV, peer-to-peer, Cloud Computing, Web 2.0 applications, and 3G/4G, are spurring the demand for higher data throughput. Service providers need innovative new technologies to manage quality of service and network security in addition to expanded monitoring, measurement and administration functions to satisfy high expectations in user experience. This means routers, switches, and communications equipment must support aggregate data rates in the 100s of Gbps with increased data processing per packet. In order to meet these requirements, data access and throughput bottlenecks between data processing elements and memory need to be solved.
