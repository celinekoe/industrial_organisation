Not satisfied with her options as a consumer, Rachel set out to create something new in the nail art category.  After a lot of research, Rachel launched Nailed Kit in September 2013. All of Nailed Kit's products are made locally in San Francisco and are non-toxic and cruelty-free. Nailed Kit teams up with some of the industry's top designers and illustrators to create the designs and give them a percentage of every sale to thank them for their hard work. The company sells direct to consumer online and has a growing subscription and wholesale business. Nailed Kit has been featured in a variety of publications such as Seventeen Magazine, Teen Vogue, Lucky Mag, Real Simple Magazine and many more!

People have become ""hyperconnected,"" with access to more contacts and data than ever before, and yet... social media does almost nothing to help build strong relationships. We call it hyperconnectedness because people are linked in some way to between 1,000 to 3,000 people, but without prompting, the human mind cannot remember more than 400-500. How odd then, that when you need someone most, you have forgotten them and in many cases they have forgotten you.  ConnectUp makes it easy to reach the people who matter, whether a business associate or a personal friend. Extending a personal touch at the right time to the right person makes all the difference in getting others to think of you. To remember you. The most successful people know this and they are better than most of us at connecting, but even the best super-connectors sense a constant pang of letting far too many relationships fade.  Welcome to the next era of technology, the era that makes you more human, not less. Discover for yourself the tremendous value of more and better relationships. Discover ConnectUp.  ConnectUp is lead by a team of executives with backgrounds creating and launching billion dollar consumer technology businesses. With experience from Microsoft, Razorfish, LendingClub, Expedia, GoPro, and Orbitz, among others, the team knows what it takes to create and deliver technology that makes a real difference. The team knows how important it is for the right people to connect at the right time to create success.  Backed by Mohr Davidow Ventures and a group of prominent Silicon Valley angel investors, ConnectUp was born of the burning desire of its founders to leverage the latest AI technologies to empower individuals to ignite, leverage and optimize their networks in a human way.","Apps, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Internet Services, Science and Engineering, Software",2,"Rob Garcia, Scott Langmack",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
