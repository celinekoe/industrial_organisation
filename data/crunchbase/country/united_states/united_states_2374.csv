As the first circuit breaker company to employ a full time national outside sales force NABCO quickly became one of the largest circuit breaker suppliers to the wholesale industry nationwide. In November 2002, NABCO became the first breaker company to institute a ‘new only’ policy, a policy that would eventually revolutionize the circuit breaker industry. Today, with brand new material being the industry standard as opposed to the exception, North American Breaker has over 150,000 square feet of brand-new material, making it easily the largest such inventory in the country.
