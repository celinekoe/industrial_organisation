His wise guidance is the best insurance against stress and failure. From an early age, Kris Bort knew that the financial world was his to conquer. And he has been thriving in this industry from the time he passed the necessary licensing requirements to be a FINRA registered broker. Bort spent almost two decades on Wall Street as a top producer. During that time, he learned all the ins and outs of the financial world, built invaluable connections and made millions for his clients. He mastered the game. He realized that there was a better way to do things. Silicon Valley insiders should not be the only ones allowed to build wealth by allocating capital towards companies that shape the future of America and the world. This has been a closed club of the privileged few for too long. It is time to level the field, let other players in, and change the rules of the game.
