First Steps In Early Robotics & Automation Researchers in Artificial Intelligence have always dreamed of building the artificial person. Up until 1986, the best they could do were mobile platforms that carefully looked at the world (with cameras and sonar), analyzed what was going on, figured out what to do next, and then did it. This made robots that worked at a snail’s pace, sometimes standing motionless for minutes on end. Then in 1986, a new idea emerged. Inspired by the way animals behave and humans carry out the routine activities of ordinary life, a new band of robotic engineers started designing much higher functioning robots that could move about the world very quickly. These robots were able to sense the world and act (or react) in less than a second. Now they had robots that could travel down hallways without hitting people, track moving objects, and even open doors.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Hardware, Science and Engineering, Software",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
