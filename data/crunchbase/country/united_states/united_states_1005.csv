IncentiVine gives local merchants an easy to use online version of what all offline local business marketing efforts are based upon: the exchange of special treatment for a customerâ€™s promotional support. A local bar owner may offer a familiar customer a few drinks on the house just as a restaurant owner may let their regulars skip the line. Or, a spa owner may perhaps give their loyal customers a free session on a slow night. While these forms of special treatment cost a local business owner hardly anything, these small gestures make a customer feel special and thus a sense of obligation to help spread the word and rave to friends and family about how great a particular establishment is. However, this also happens to be the single most time consuming and exhausting part of running a local business. Additionally, the promotional strength of a local business is typically limited to the ownerâ€™s personal network and the amount of personal face-time he dedicates to his customers. With IncentiVine, local business owners can drastically multiply the effectiveness of their marketing efforts by incentivizing brand advocates and loyal customers to quickly and effectively share their message to thousands of their friends and family via email, Facebook, Twitter, and other popular online social networks. Owners can also track which of their brand advocates are truly influential and which ones to not waste time and energy on. Our platform gives an owner the ability to automate and manage their in house marketing efforts so that they can focus on what they do best, providing an excellent local service.","Advertising, Apps, Food and Beverage, Information Technology, Sales and Marketing, Software, Travel and Tourism",1,Jaime Sugino,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
