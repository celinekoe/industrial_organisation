We're specialists in direct marketing and sales and our passion is the renewable energy sector. We are a small privately held firm based in Cincinnati that is rapidly growing, thanks to our dedicated staff and awesome clients. If there's one thing that all businesses have in common, it's the need for loyal customers. This also happens to be one of the most challenging feats for companies large and small. This is why multi-million dollar corporations are turning to Ardor. We are experts in generating revenue by bringing in new customers and thereby increasing market share. Human to human, face to face interaction is at the core of Ardor's methods. There is nothing in the world that can replace a smile and a handshake. Rather than a ""sell, sell, sell"" approach, Ardor believes in establishing a genuine rapport and first building trust. Our account managers spend time building relationships with our clients' customers and finding out their pain points. From there, they propose custom solutions. In most cases, our clients have spent millions of dollars building brand recognition. They've advertised through billboards, commercials, online ads, print ads, and everything in between. Indirect marketing, however, has its limits. While it can do wonders to turn a brand into a household name, it doesn't necessarily compel consumers to go out and buy. Ardor bridges this gap by driving sales today. We are a team unlike most. We proudly work with some of the most impressive professionals in the U.S. They are highly passionate and goal-driven individuals of sound character who will stop at nothing to achieve success. Ardor cultivates these existing qualities by providing opportunities for our team members to grow and develop. Training is a standard part of our weekly routines. Backed by the support of Ardor's management team, all employees are encouraged to step out of their comfort zones and take on new responsibility. We offer ample opportunity for advancement and live by a philosophy that hard work should be rewarded. The direct result is that our clients receive 100% from Ardor. We can be counted on to deliver - and we will do so with ardor.

Our solution is targeted at the fitness market and fills the gap between the human-driven traditional gyms and data-driven AI fitness, allowing gym owners, fitness instructors, and members to enjoy the benefits of both worlds. We use AI to enhance fitness instructors, not to replace them, because we believe it's time to put community back into community-based fitness. With 9 out of 10 Americans planning to continue to work-out from home traditional fitness is getting left behind with pen & pencil or low-tech band-aids while AI fitness is removing the human element altogether. But humans crave social connections with other humans - in fact, it's the greatest predictor of longevity. Our user interviews confirm the importance of community with 53% of people who exercise and 91% of trainers reporting that they enjoy the aspect of community and interaction with others.  Our easily accessible, mobile solution does not require any hardware and allows fitness instructors to provide real-time, motivating feedback during remote, or hybrid, interactive classes, without having to stop demonstrating proper form and technique while saving countless hours on data analysis through AI generated insights and customized, actionable wellness plans. For fitness users instead of working out in front of a mirror, you can work out in front of a live fitness instructor - the same instructor you have at your local gym - while still receiving the data-driven metrics that are expected from AI fitness.","Apps, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Mobile, Software",1,Jennifer Strout,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
