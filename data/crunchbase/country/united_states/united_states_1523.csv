Located along the Eel River in Humboldt County, beside the Avenue of the Giants, we use ancient dry-farming techniques to grow cannabis in its purest, most natural state, with no artificial light or chemical pesticides. We are proud of our dry-farming technique, an ancient, intuitive method that requires no irrigation, which conserves water, reduces waste, and encourages natural abundance. Dry-farming allows the plant to grow in its natural cycle, pulling minerals and nutrients from the rich soil beneath them, and strengthening in the wind and sun. This develops higher levels of THC and essential oils, leading to a final flower with a uniquely rich, concentrated flavor and more potent effects. We stay true to our heritage and farming methods when it comes to making our products. We start with the highest-quality whole plant freshly picked from our own land (never waste or trim), use only organic food-grade solvents to extract, preserve the most aromatic terpenes, and carefully craft each batch to deliver a clean, pure flavor. Because we start and finish with all of our own superior, sustainably-grown materials, our products are safe, potent and delicious.","Agriculture and Farming, Community and Lifestyle, Food and Beverage, Health Care",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
