The company has developed diagnostic kits for breast, colon, ovarian, and prostate cancers, and markets diagnostic kits in Europe for the detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in patients with breast and colon cancer. Product and Product Candidate Pipeline The company's portfolio of compounds and technologies under development or planned development include: AdnaGen Oncology Diagnostics; A Liposomal TS Inhibitor; Cordycepin; L-Nucleoside Conjugates; and Novel Tubulin Isotype-Specific Anti-Mitotics. AdnaGen Diagnostic Products The company's subsidiary, AdnaGen A.G., offers diagnostic products for colon and breast cancer diagnosis in the European market. It has the ability to detect and recognize the expression of tumor-associated biomarkers in patients with metastatic cancer. In September 2008, AdnaGen entered into a distribution and license agreement with Biomarkers LLC (Biomarkers) granting Biomarkers the right to distribute the AdnaGen diagnostic kits in North America. AdnaGen also entered into a distribution and license agreement with Biomarkers granting Biomarkers the right to distribute the AdnaGen diagnostic kits in South America and the Middle East. In January 2007, AdnaGen entered into a distribution agreement with Innogenetics N.V. (Innogenetics) granting Innogenetics the right to commercialize the AdnaGen diagnostic kits in the European market. In September 2007, AdnaGen entered into a license agreement with Innogenetics granting Innogenetics the right to use AdnaGen technology in adapting Innogenetics' proprietary strip detection technology after successful feasibility studies. Liposomal Thymidylate Synthase (TS) Inhibitor (OVI-237) (solid tumors) OVI-237 is the company's advanced clinical stage drug. OVI-237 is a liposome encapsulated formulation of a potent thymidylate synthase inhibitor (TSI) with activity at picomolar concentrations. It was obtained as a result of a worldwide licensing agreement with OSI Pharmaceuticals (Melville, New York). With OVI-237, it has finalized the protocol and selected clinical sites to conduct a Phase II Study of OVI-237 monotherapy and combination therapy with cisplatin for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Cordycepin (OVI-123) (TdT-Positive Refractory Leukemias) The company is developing Cordycepin as a treatment option for certain leukemia patients that are either refractory to chemotherapeutics or have experienced a relapse. Cordycepin depends upon the presence of a DNA polymerase, known as terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), for its therapeutic activity. Cordycepin has been studied in a National Cancer Institute-sponsored Phase I clinical trial for treating TdT-positive ALL leukemia patients. It initiated a Phase I/II trial based on the â€˜original' ADA-sensitive compound. L-Nucleoside Conjugate (OVI-117): The company has accumulated in vitro and in vivo data indicating that the L-nucleoside conjugates are effective against various types of cancer. One of its L-nucleoside conjugate candidates, OVI-117, is a conjugate of an L-nucleoside (L-uridine) and the highly toxic compound 5'-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP), a thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitor. Tubulin Isotype-Specific Anti-mitotics The company's other platform technology relates to a proprietary database of tubulin isotypes as potential candidates for targeting by certain chemotherapeutics. It is evaluating various candidates as part of its research and development in this area. Collaborative Relationships and Partnerships The company has relationships with the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA), the Cancer Therapy and Research Center (CTRC), the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, MD Anderson Cancer Center and the San Antonio Cancer Institute (SACI), a cancer research institute.

Ripl.io is a bit like an online talent agency blended in with the Neilson rating system. It’s a place where the web’s most popular content sharers/curators can measure, tune, and learn to grow their popularity. Ripl.io connects its users with the brands they’re excited about, giving them opportunity to monetize their social media efforts. More specifically, Ripl.io gives you great web analytics for your Pinterest Boards and Flipboard Magazines, with more platforms on the way. Based on the topics you post about, the size of your audience, and the location you reside in, you may also get the opportunity to make a living just by continuing to share interesting and exclusive information online. Why is Ripl.io a good idea? Currently there aren’t very many options for online curators to make a living with their ability to mine internet gold. Which, unfortunately, means that they’re less likely to continue to spend hoards of time helping the rest of them tame the noisy web. Ripl.io is meant to incentivize and support the amazing work of their favorite pinners, posters and flippers. How did you come up with Ripl.io? Ripl.io was birthed within the world of online advertising. Which I still feel funny saying, and always get a few eye-rolls when I do. I came up in the professional world of online display advertising and microsites. Trust me, I’m as hopeful for change as you are. I was astonished by the budgets being invested in creating brand advertising through boxes, their old friend the “banner ad”. At the risk of being dramatic, It’s a bit like the tobacco industry. All the research and studies prove the harmfulness, yet the industry trucks on. It kept me up at night. There had to be a better way to tell the world your brand’s story. So I picked the brains of the smartest people I knew in the industry, and was happy to see I wasn’t the only one thinking about this problem, or brainstorming a solution. As an avid user of social media, and a hopeless early adopter, I was blown away by the popularity and usefulness of content aggregation sites. My obsession started with Digg, Reddit and Break, and then grew towards Pinterest and Flipboard. They’ve been witness to the rapid growth of the online world, it’s vastness is staggering, these sites added sanity. The hubs grew from the spokes. Online curation became somewhat of a celebrity. Overnight, everyday Janes and Joes could have millions of eager fans drooling over their Pin Boards. Trends on these sites influence more than their entertainment habits, they influenced their purchasing habits. I pawn over the top sneaker-head boards, ready to see what the freshest fruit Nike has to offer is.. and clicking through with card in hand. They inadvertently stumbled across the soul of the brands they love. Pictures and words drawn from real-life experiences and fostered through the fulfillment of a product’s promise. By immersing myself in the thought process of the brand marketer, then stepping back as a consumer, I recognized that the key to online marketing wasn’t shouting from your store-front, plastering fancy tag-lines everywhere, or hiring expensive celebrities.. it’s in the hearts of your advocates. Your fangirls and fanboys. Whether your business is just getting started, or an established gorilla in its industry, they’ve proven that participating and encouraging your brand’s online advocates are your most effective channels for marketing. It starts with amazing products, continues with simple yet effective branded content, and is then amplified through your brand’s top tastemakers. Who’s Ripl.io for? Ripl.io is for anyone who’s excited to grow and cultivate a social media audience. Whether you aspire to be, or are currently renowned as, a subject matter expert, Ripl.io can help you better understand how well received your content sharing is by your online community. Ripl.io is a place for brands to learn who their biggest online advocates are. Get insights on what your audience cares most about and how to better meet their needs and expectations for things like branded entertainment, product insights, and feedback.
