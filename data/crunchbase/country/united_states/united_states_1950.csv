We knew we wanted to start our own family and share those special moments with those closest to us, many of whom happened to be thousands of miles away. Also during that time, we were selling the first consumer web-based business that I co-founded (3GUpload.com), so it was the perfect moment to combine our love of family and business. Fast-forwarding to 2010 (after a few attempts to build our own solution), we had an opportunity to expand the eFamily service with the acquisition of Famiva.com. At that point, we were able to realize our original vision of family sites with photos, videos, status updates, shared calendar, family tree, and custom family domains. Our company grew, but – like nearly every online business – we started seeing strong demand for mobile versions of our service. And so in 2013, we decided to purchase the software assets from a company called Origami. We loved Origami’s software solution including the mobile applications – arguably the best in the marketplace. Our plan with the Origami software acquisition is to create an even more powerful eFamily service. We’ll take the lessons we’ve learned from our experience in the family space, and we’ll apply those to this powerful new platform moving forward. So in closing, a lot of people wonder why we’ve been diligently pursuing this business for over 8 years. It may seem illogical to most, but there is a deeper reason and motivation than just business success and financial rewards. We truly believe a site like eFamily.com can change the world for the better. When we look back on our lives, we will be able to say that we helped families stay connected and celebrate life – no matter the distance.  eFamily.com believe that at the root of positive change in society is a group of healthy families, and part of staying healthy as a family is communication and celebrating life. As a result of our efforts, we hope to help this world become a better place.
