It is available iOS and Android. The platform dynamically creates ephemeral chat rooms for these airings that are created 15 minutes before any given show starts and then boots all users from the room 15 minutes after the show ends. These 15 minute buffer periods are for discussion to warm up and cool down with the show. Users interact in a very similar manner that they would in a Slack or Discord. Chat features like @ing other users, posting gifs and reacting to messages are available. They can also dynamically create what are called ""Hashrooms"" which are rooms within rooms to narrow discussion during a particular show. These are equitable to Slack or Discord channels. When users first enter the app, they are anonymous. Anonymous users are assigned a random username and have the ability to start chatting right away. Users can register their accounts (via email) to change their username and perform other more privileged actions in the app. Along with being anonymous, they are assigned a generic channel listing grid that corresponds to their current (phone) timezone. This consists of the major networks and other popular, yet non-local, channels. If users register their accounts, they have the ability to enter their zip code and change their TV provider to a local one to gain a larger channel list/local channels. Users (anonymous and registered) have the ability to ""follow"" series, sports teams or one-off shows via notifications. Notifications are sent out when the rooms open for the given show, to which users can instantly pop right into the show room and start chatting.","Apps, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Mobile, Software, Video",1,Matt Oliver,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

As larger pharma companies have entered this field through maturation of their internal programs or through licensing agreements with smaller companies, new challenges have emerged; CMC and regulatory teams must adapt their internal systems, usually geared towards small molecule therapeutics, to the unique requirements of oligonucleotides.

Fundamentally, we believe too many people aren't being paid what they're worth.  It happens for a lot of reasons, but we believe with verified data and and the right support, we can get you the compensation you deserve. Earner helps you get paid fairly. First, we provide a free OfferScore, which is an evaluation of your offer letter (or letters) so you know how the offer measures up.  Most people focus on base and bonus when they look at their offers, but these only make up 70% of your total compensation. We thoroughly assess your PTO policies, 401K retirement plans, health benefits, commuter stipends, and many more to find the true value of your offer.  We build our free OfferScore by comparing your offers to thousands of others from companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Oracle, and privately-held startups - then use that data to help you negotiate effectively for a better compensation package. With an OfferScore in hand, we then work with you to build a Gameplan - that's what we call our partnering approach to negotiation.  For a flat fee, we work with you throughout the negotiation process to help you get what you deserve.  The Gameplan lays out an overall approach and specific guidance for every aspect of your negotiation, including likely counter-arguments.  We update the Gameplan as we work with you, so you always have our best advice and the right language to make your case.  If our work together doesn't result in an improved offer, you pay nothing - that's our commitment to seeing you succeed. Earner's mission is to make every professional feel valued and fulfilled by their work, and that can't happen if you're not being paid fairly.
