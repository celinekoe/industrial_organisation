Using this data, JumpTime has built a suite of applications designed to help business's better understand the actual dollar value of their content.

Founded as a professional services firm, JumpTime began by offering strategic engagement and traffic optimization consulting to some of the largest and most influential media companies. The idea to develop a platform emerged as their founders (who have real-world experience managing and growing online audience engagement for companies like MTV, Nickelodeon, Virgin Interactive, Unilever and Yahoo!) realized they could best use their insights by turning their tools over to their clients. Their clients could then apply these insights to their daily operations. Jumptime's technology draws from the fields of econometrics, data mining, machine learning and financial engineering.

Our vision of jewelry is old school. It’s the kind of work that only comes from a master craftsman or silversmith consumed with creating magic. That one-of-a-kind piece designed specifically for you, not the masses. That’s how it used to be done. Thing is, true craftsmanship has been kicked out the door by companies more focused on cheap labor and cost savings. Not us. It didn’t take long to realize if we were ever going to get exactly what we wanted, we’d have to make it ourselves. Our enthusiasm wasn’t very well received. Every avenue we pursued led to industry ‘experts’ who tried to change our minds. They said we had to rethink our art to pander to the masses. We’d have to get rid of the ‘Freedom or Death’ and skulls that define our work. The final straw was telling us an American product couldn’t compete, we’d never make a living crafting these pieces here at home and we’d have to take production overseas. Deep down, they were really saying we’d have to abandon our American dream. One of the many things we love about this country and her people: Americans don’t take kindly to people telling us we can’t do something. For us, the choice was clear. We will not turn our back on the country that built us. We will do it the hard way and we’ll do it the right way—a mantra that used to be the American way. Our American dream was born a few years ago, in our garage, by our own hands, in the dead heat of an Arizona desert summer. We know we might not grow as big as the lifeless brands that fill the stores. We’re okay with that. Every job we bring to our community is worth it. This mentality will never change. We’ll give our heart and our hands to our craft, right here at home in Chandler, Arizona. When we sign our pieces with NightRider and USA, you can bet they’ll be signed with pride because our veins aren’t the only ones that still pump red, white, and blue. Together, we intend to prove it.

The aim of the study is to keep patients  engaged in the self-management of glucose and carbohydrate logging between prenatal appointments to reduce the need for medications and to ensure the best possible outcomes for mothers and neonates. Our preliminary results show an increased rate of compliance with inter-session blood glucose monitoring in the study population who utilized GlucoseMama.  In addition, there is a 100% compliance rate in individuals who utilize the system in postpartum screening for type 2 diabetes and postpartum follow-up.
