South American countries are known for falling behind in technological advancements such as the internet and mobile. Blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and DLT technologies offer a more transparent, decentralized, and faster transaction of data and information across borders.  South American citizens have been victims of hyperinflation, corruption, economic disasters and political instability. As with most big tech companies, not so many blockchain projects have set their eyes on the Latin American continent for varied reasons, problems, and resources. We want to change that, thus we believe with education, we will be able to create entrepreneurs, students, and professionals hungry to thrive in this disruptive wave, thus creating an ecosystem of talented individuals to compete with leading countries in the industry and resolve some of South Americans biggest flaws. Latinos have 65% mobile penetration and 55% of its citizens are unbanked. Together with Lumit Blockchain and Blockchain at Berkeley, we launched an online e-learning platform called Academia 21 to educate Latinos about blockchain in Spanish and offer courses for blockchain development, fundamentals, business use cases, smart contracts, token economics, investing, token creation and more. Our vision is to be the gateway of blockchain powered solutions to South American governments and companies within the supply chain management, healthcare, and real estate industries.","Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Education, Information Technology, Internet Services, Other",1,Menajem Benchimol,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

On a daily basis, Chapman’s leading brand, CarbonX® fabrics, protects individuals working in some of the world's most hazardous environments within the industrial, firefighting, motorsports, and tactical markets. No other brand of flame-resistant (FR) fabric or apparel protects professionals working in extreme conditions like CarbonX. With TPP and ATPV ratings far surpassing industry standards, CarbonX significantly outperforms similarly classified FR wear. The superior performance of CarbonX products can be attributed to their high-performance fiber blend. This patented fiber blend provides an extraordinary level of protection and enables their PPE solutions to be optimized for a wide variety of applications. CarbonX products are constructed to be truly non-flammable. They will not burn, melt, drip, ignite, shrink, or char when exposed to direct flame or extreme heat; are highly resistant to molten metal splash, flammable liquids, and certain chemicals; and provide excellent protection from arc flash hazards. Even after intense exposure, CarbonX products maintain their strength and integrity and continue to protect. CarbonX products combine an extreme level of protection with maximum comfort. They are lightweight, soft-to-the-touch, and flexible, wearing much like cotton. They also breathe well, wick away moisture, and dry quickly, enhancing the wearer’s comfort and productivity and reducing the potential for fatigue and heat stress. Because CarbonX products are inherently non-flammable, their thermal protective properties will not wash out or wear away. They have a long wear life and are machine washable and easy to care for. Apparel made of CarbonX fabrics can be worn daily as part of a total PPE solution, providing significant value to users. CarbonX partners with leading safety supply distributors and manufacturers to deliver customized PPE solutions. They work closely with their partners to understand their customers’ needs and then provide solutions to meet those needs. This collaborative approach has led to many innovative product developments and increased business opportunities for their partners. CarbonX also has the advantage of being owned by Tex Tech Industries Inc., a global developer and manufacturer of engineered, high-performance materials. Tex Tech’s worldwide distribution platform and in-house engineering, testing, and manufacturing capabilities enable the development and introduction of new CarbonX products to the market much more quickly.","Commerce and Shopping, Government and Military, Manufacturing",,,1-10,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
