USA Staffing org is Free and best choice when it comes to providing top quality candidates for your permanent, temp-to-permanent, seasonal or one-day staffing needs. we are special in the below field to assist , us staffing login US Staffing is a process that refers to the recruitment of employees for a company or organization by a staffing agency. The staffing agency sources, screens, and interviews candidates for the company, thereby saving the company time and effort in the hiring process. US Staffing is commonly used by companies that require temporary, contract or permanent staffing solutions. The US Staffing process typically begins with a job order from the client company. The staffing agency then sources candidates through various means, such as job boards, social media, and employee referrals. The agency then screens the candidates to ensure they meet the job requirements and conducts interviews to assess their skills and experience. Once the agency has identified suitable candidates, they submit them to the client company for consideration. One of the benefits of US Staffing is that it allows companies to quickly fill temporary or contract positions without the need to advertise or conduct their own recruitment process. This can be especially useful for companies with high turnover or those in industries that experience seasonal fluctuations in demand. Another benefit of US Staffing is that it allows companies to quickly scale their workforce up or down as needed. For example, a company may need to hire additional staff to complete a project within a specific timeframe, and US Staffing allows them to do so without having to hire permanent employees. Similarly, if a company experiences a downturn in demand, they can quickly reduce their workforce without the need for layoffs. US Staffing agencies typically charge a fee for their services, which can be a percentage of the candidate’s salary or a flat fee per placement. This fee is usually paid by the client company and is in addition to the candidate’s salary. However, the fee is often offset by the savings that the company achieves by not having to conduct their own recruitment process. One of the challenges of US Staffing is ensuring that the candidate selected is a good fit for the company’s culture and values. This is because the staffing agency may not have a thorough understanding of the company’s culture and values, which can make it difficult to assess whether a candidate is a good fit. To address this challenge, some US Staffing agencies work closely with the client company to develop a better understanding of their culture and values and to ensure that candidates are a good fit. Another challenge of US Staffing is ensuring that the candidate has the necessary skills and experience to perform the job. This is because the staffing agency may not have the same level of expertise as the client company in the specific industry or job function. To address this challenge, some US Staffing agencies specialize in specific industries or job functions and have subject matter experts who can assess candidates’ skills and experience. US Staffing tool and it is a useful process for companies that require temporary, contract, or permanent staffing solutions. It allows companies to quickly fill positions, scale their workforce up or down as needed, and save time and effort in the hiring process. However, US Staffing agencies must be careful to ensure that candidates are a good fit for the company’s culture and values and have the necessary skills and experience to perform the job.

Urbanavtic,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/urbanavtic,"Auto Insurance, Automotive, Information Services, Information Technology","New York, New York, United States",Urbanvtic is the engineering company developing the synthetic positioning platform for autonomous driving.,"225,910","Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",,Closed,2018-01-05,day,,,,none,For Profit,http://urbanavtic.com,"Urban mobility Urban mobility problems are root in: low location accuracy (+/- 20 meters), low fidelity of speed estimation (+/- 5 kph), high latency of positioning solution accessibility (1 second delay and more), unstable signal availability (often less than 4 satellites in view), multipath of navigation signal in urban canyons, narrow and dense built areas. These parameters are unacceptable for manned and autonomous transportation in cities. That is arise the following problems for manned navigation: skipping proper turns and making wrong turns, getting on improper driveway or taking false exit on road junctions, loss of navigation and jumps of position in: urban canyons, financial districts, sky scrapers blocks, narrow and dense built areas; loss of navigation and incorrect positioning in city tunnels, nearby viaducts and overpasses, absence of navigation inside underground, under roof, multilevel parking lots, no seamless outdoor/indoor navigation. All mentioned issues makes customers unsure and unsatisfied. Autonomous/self-driving From the autonomous/self-driving point of view the goals are: decimeter grade of absolute positioning within a global reference frame, relative localization/location displacement estimation accuracy – 10 cm per 100 sec, speed estimation accuracy – 5 cm/sec, course estimation accuracy – 0,1-0,5 deg. Effective integration of navigation and machine control information sources as GNSS, IMU (gyro, accelerometer), 3D compass, Digital Map, Radar, Lidar, Image-based Positioning and Computer Vision. Solution to the navigation/positioning task mainly within GNSS+IMU+3DMap+Image-based Positioning techs. To allocate the Computer Vision and Radar/Lidar techs mostly for obstacle avoidance, objects recognition and machine control functions. Urbanavtic technology  Urbanavtic approach to urban mobility and autonomous/self-driving technology solution concludes in deep engineering synthetic navigation design consist of: tight couple integration of GNSS with internal sensors (IMU) using raw data of satellite receiver, map based corrections (road graph and turns matching), image-based positioning (reference points detection and images recognition; no permanent scene analysis typical for obstacle avoidance, no high power and computation consumption). The software only product using just a platform sensors running on smartphones and in-dash auto systems. Auto insurance Auto insurance problem: it is a must to have precise motion trajectories of manned and autonomous vehicles’ in absolute and relative coordinates in case of collision happened. Traditional and unmanned vehicles collide today and will collide in future for various reasons. Perfectly reconstructed trajectories based on robust motion data opens the opportunity for automatic arbitration and resolution of road traffic incidents and accidents. Achievable centimeter accuracy of relative and decimeter accuracy of absolute positioning is the core technology for automatic collisions arbitration. High labor costs of “manual” non-automatic settlement of traffic accidents and insurance cases nowadays. Bottom line: no clear picture of road traffic accident, no data to judge who is responsible for crash, no data for crash analysis.  Urbanavtic technology  Urbanavtic’s auto insurance technology solution is founded on: precise relative positioning (estimation of the location displacement) based on phase measurements of GNSS and transferring to absolute coordinates using map matching methods and image-based positioning. Here we use applied measurements: GNSS raw data, primarily the accumulated phases and MEMS IMU sensors, image frames from camera. Dynamic adaptation of data processing based on a constant analysis of consistency of measurements from the phase tracking channels. Exact reconstruction of vehicles’ trajectories based on entire set of kinematic parameters including accelerations, velocities and angular velocities. Hereby we have opened the opportunity for automatic arbitration of road traffic accidents, cut costs of insurance companies, save time and money for drivers. Demonstration of results The video of the technology real time tests on Android smartphone will be demonstrated in the frame of presentation. Interested customers will be welcome for field tests.
