We have been selling on eBay since 1999 but started selling PS4 decals in 2014 and quickly became one of the largest sellers of custom PS4 decal on eBay. We then founded this website in 2015 to help are customers create more detail designs and have a better experience and to be able to earn reward points with every purchase. After selling our home security business in October 2013, my husband and I were looking for our next adventure that we could enjoy doing TOGETHER. With nothing really coming together, one day, we went to my brother in laws house for dinner and he showed my husband a PS4 led light bar decal that he had just purchased. Sean took one look at it and thought to himself “I bet Sarah could make this!” I looked at it, we borrowed a decal from his brother, took it home, and began to get to work! The rest is history! We already had made many decals (for signage) for the security business we owned in the past and had some of the machines we needed to get started. So, we started with the standard cut decals and within only a few short weeks began to make custom decals due to the request of one our biggest client (who is still with us today). We both enjoy being creative, have an attention to detail, and the satisfaction that comes from making things, plus, we both like playing games from time to time and so we knew this company would be something that not only we would be good at, but also something that we would both would enjoy doing!  Over the years PS4DECALS.COM has grown quickly and we are now selling all sorts of custom gaming decals online across multiple platforms. Our goal was to have fast turnaround times, great quality items at affordable prices, and excellent customer service. We not only feel as though we have been able to do that, but we also have thousands of reviews from the various platforms that we sell on which say that we do from the customers which have fallen in love with our product, and us. Within the time frame that we have been in business we have grown in two main areas, one being where we ship. We offer our products to many countries outside of the USA and are proud to say that we work well with our clients from all over the world! Second, we are excited to say that our product line up has expanded into many areas such as T-SHIRTS, MUGS, MOUSE PADS, KEYCHAINS, BUMPER STICKERS, Etc! We really have become known as the “ALL THINGS VINYL” business! We are really excited about this because this allows us to be not only a custom gaming decals shop but a total custom shop for the gaming world as well as many other areas of interest!   So, what makes us different than everyone else? I am glad that you asked! We do our VERY best to make our clients happy on EVERY order! We ship with fast shipping times (typically within the same day it is ordered) and we also respond very quickly to questions that are asked of us. There is very little wait time when it comes to getting a question answered! We pride ourselves on providing our customers with the highest level of customer service! You see, we wouldn’t have a business if it wasn’t for YOU, our customer, & because we realize that, we promise the personal attention and care that you deserve with EVERY order! We see it this way, the golden rule, “Do until others as you would like to have done unto you!” If you are looking for something that you don’t see, PLEASE, contact us and we will be happy to serve you to the best of our ability! Thank YOU for being the BEST part of our company & for allowing us to be in business!
