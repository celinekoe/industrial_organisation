Volunteering is a beautiful thing. It’s a way to help improve the lives of people all around the world while making the whole thing a better place. But knowing where to start isn’t always easy. You have to find an organization, dig through their events, find one that fits your schedule and hope that maybe, just maybe, it might be something you genuinely care about. Sounds familiar, right? Many times these tasks get in the way of the real matter at hand. What am I passionate about? What is my purpose for volunteering? At SERVEMERGE®, we believe community impact is more genuine and lasts longer when those volunteering are passionate and proactive with their time, talent and treasure. We think your full effort should go toward serving the causes you care about most — not being bogged down with tasks of connecting and scheduling. There’s a better, more efficient way to volunteer and we want to help you get started. Our platform makes finding your passions and putting them into easy place. Skopos asks, You answer. Skopos is our way of helping you find the causes you believe in and the ways you’re able to help. It’s the core of your SERVEMERGE® profile and the core of everything we stand for.

We had signed a rent agreement with the owner of Fun & Fit Gymnastics, who has been enthusiastic about having our presence as a cross promotion opportunity, in addition to the additional income from our rent payments.  Yet the teacher we hired already has her own home studio  offering the same curriculum, and could not accommodate the times that initial student families had available . We realized that our hiring strategy needed to focus on obtaining fresh enthusiastic instructors willing to be licensed and trained. This presented an additional funding challenge. Our chosen curriculum, Simply Music - link provided - is a proven method for unveiling natural musicality, providing group music  instruction for babies through 5 years old and piano for ages 4 through adult. The founder, Neil Moore, originally invented the system after he was asked to teach an 8 year old blind boy how to play.  Note reading is intentionally delayed for about a year, which allows anyone and everyone to experience playing great sounding music on the piano - with right and left hands - on the very 1st lesson.  Although the costs of licensing instructors is high, the long term benefits of offering a consistent and pure curriculum - with proven results on 3 continents, is worth the investment in employees, especially for being able to deliver vetted value to customers.  Even though there is a considerable amount of projected revenue from lessons, we realize there is even more that can be generated through digital and acoustic piano sales.  The founder's 5 1/2 years experience in a retail piano store environment provides unique insight and motivation into this """"non retail store"""" strategy of selling.  Selling is online based, through client surveys, and comfortable """"subscription plans"""" options.","Education, Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio, Other",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The data: bar ratings, party listings, and items for sale is free for users to list and comment on and is meant to enhance the college life experience. SeÃ±or College was created by Direct Hit Solutions, Inc, a highly decorated Online Marketing / Web Development company outside Chicago, Illinois. The idea was supported and developed by several recently-graduated minds and overseen by company President and CEO, Brian Reiff.  SeÃ±or College has three main parts: The Bar Scene, The Red Cup and The College Marketplace. The ""Bar Scene"" contains over 20,000 college bars at 600+ colleges and universities. Users are able to rate and comment on their local hot spots including bars and clubs as well as upload pictures. Bar owners can buy premium membership and add bar details and drink specials to promote their business to local college students. The â€œRed Cupâ€ section is a place to list and rate campus parties at over 600 colleges and universities including parties from clubs and organizations like fraternities and sororities or other venue parties. Users can also comment and upload pictures, but the detailed information (date, location) is visible to registered users only. The â€œCollege Marketplaceâ€ section is the place that college students can post items for sale that they donâ€™t need anymore and promote them exclusively to their fellow classmates. This section is divided into five categories including books, electronics, furniture, housing and random items. Since the average college student is already worried about their finances, this gives them an opportunity to cash in and sell their unwanted items to fellow classmates.

AlertFlyers is a complete online system that offers a huge array of inclusive features, extremely competitive pricing, and simplified user tools, all bundled in a super easy to use online solution.   Besides being easy and affordable, and while not ignoring those users wanting the traditional softer sell newsletter formats (which most email marketing providers exclusively offer), AlertFlyers has smartly designed their system for users primarily wanting a more hard hitting promotional format.   What's great about AlertFlyers, is unlike itâ€™s more popular competitors, there are no monthly fees or minimum charges; membership is free (although they have an annual preferred membership option for only $99.95 that provides 25% off all purchases); and what they include are sure to make email marketers take notice. AlertFlyers charges as little as $9.95 per campaign and their pricing per thousand costs are noticeably less than other email marketing providers. However, if thatâ€™s not reason enough to try them out, they include an amazing array of complimenting features that are sure to boost anyoneâ€™s email marketing efforts.  AlertFlyers includes with every email campaign itâ€™s own web site and unique URL you can post anywhere on the internet. They include a 12-image slide show (a great feature that can be used for not only product images, but for creating online presentations). For increasing reader click-through performance, they include icon and link choices you can customize. Once youâ€™ve done so, they are automatically placed along the base of each flyer sent. AlertFlyers also includes a very comprehensive tracking and reporting system, an email list index and list management suite that even includes a tool to create personalized opt-in lists, not bad for less than ten bucks. comming soon.!!","Advertising, Commerce and Shopping, Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment, Sales and Marketing",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
