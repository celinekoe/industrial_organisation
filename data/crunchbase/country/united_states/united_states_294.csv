Drawing on more than 10 years of experience building ice vending machines, Bag of Ice produces high quality, cost-effective ice and purified water vending machines for profit-minded individuals and businesses. Recognizing both the economic advantages of producing ice on-site and the flexibility of machine placement, BOI designs small footprint, high capacity units that compete not only with both the existing ice merchandisers selling delivered ice, but with larger ice vending manufacturers whose machines are the size of a small building. BOI’s units not only produce quantities of ice equal to much larger machines, but are also ecologically friendly as they require no costly refrigeration systems. As an innovative company, BOI was the first company to introduce this cost-saving, profit-making feature to the market place.

Its core product – Ledger Pay System is the platform that supports four types of financial services, all based on use of virtual tokens: (1) donations, (2) payments, (3) personal savings and investments, and (4) loyalty rewards.  Collection, distribution and utilization of donations today is very complicated, expensive and slow process. The main reason for that is many intermediaries in the financial flow between donors and beneficiaries. High fees and overheads, long time delays, lack of information on needs and effects for beneficiaries, and various other obstacles make todays donations more beneficial to the charities and various intermediaries than to beneficiaries themselves.   Ledger Pay solves all these problems using an innovative technology approach – peer-to–peer transactions. The System is based on use of secure financial distributed ledger. All participants in a global, international non-profit financial transactions are registered in the Ledger, thus creating global but integrated community. With this approach and by utilization of ledger services, the system has faster, instantaneous transfers with very cheap rates, as overheads are very low. The system is linked to the ACH and bankcard networks. Another very important and distinctive feature of the System is that it uses, so called, virtual tokens for all its financial transactions. Instead of transferring US $, which have many financial and regulatory restrictions, donors convert their US $ into virtual currency called CRIPTo – Charities, Religious, International, Political Token. Then such tokens are freely exchanged between all parties using personal Ledger Pay Wallets. Combined with several other virtual currency systems (Giftz, SocialCash) the system provides rewards for promotion, support, and volunteer activities. Its ultimate mission is to become global, international, worldwide secure system for payments and other international transactions for all those with and without bank accounts and bank cards. The System is already developed (beta) and needs commercial improvements to become operational. The Company has very experienced management team,  several expert advisers, and the first partners and customers. ","Financial Services, Information Technology",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

In college, he developed an interest in digital electronics and personal computers, particularly those based on 8086 and 80286 microprocessors. His first complete software application was an obfuscation software utility written in x86 assembly language and run on MS-DOS. In November 2013, we launched our first product, the TL100, a true hardware random number generator with a speed of 1.4 Mbps. In September 2014, we unveiled the TL200, a lighter and smaller all-purpose true hardware random number generator that generates numbers effectively and promptly at a speed of 2.0 megabits per second or faster. In January 2018, we released SwiftRNG Pro, the world’s fastest small-form random number generator.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware",1,Andrian Belinski,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
