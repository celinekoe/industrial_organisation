Its flagship product Auto Shutdown Manager enables customers to centrally control and reduce energy used by PCs on their network by between 40% and up to 85% without affecting end users or IT performance. 50 percent of working Americans leave their office PCs on when they leave for the night, creating a massive carbon footprint. According to Gartner, PCs and monitors account for 40% of all global information technology CO2 emissions. Collectively, US organizations waste $3 billion every year powering 100 million unused PCs. A single PC left on over night and on weekends will waste between $40 and $100 and up to 620 lbs of CO2 per year.   Auto Shutdown Manager is a small software that enables you to minimize your PC network power consumption by automatically putting idle laptops, desktops, workstations and servers across your network reliably into power saving modes for instant energy conservation.   University of Berkeley, Dept of IS has a productive Auto Shutdown Manager environment with real time power metering. They achieved a reduction in PC energy consumption of 85% or over 35.000 kWh in 6 months. That converts into savings of more than $4000 for 100 PCâ€™s. You can see the impact of using Auto Shutdown Manager here:  Berkeley Green IT Initiative Auto Shutdown Manager is lean and does not require any responsibility or change in habits by your end-users and its CPU and RAM footprint is small, so even older computers benefit from Auto Shutdown Manager.","Energy, Information Technology, Software",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
