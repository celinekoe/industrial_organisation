After a little spit polish and elbow grease, I was really amazed by how pristine this machine was underneath its century's worth of rust and dust. And even more amazing: it still worked!  Typewriters are just really beautiful and elegant pieces of technology, and it has always struck me as sad that they are now neglected and almost forgotten, especially considering that most computer stuff today is so disposable and utilitarian. People love typewriters, and lots of people have them on their mantlepiece or in their attic, but there is just no place for them on a modern computer desk. So, with the USB Typewriter project I am trying to help people rescue typewriters from garages and attics and put them to use again.  In my online store, I sell a do-it-yourself kit can add a USB port to any typewriter.  The kit can either be purchased pre-assembled and ready to install, or as a fun solder-it-yourself electronics kit.  I also sell a range of lovingly restored and USB-enabled typewriters, but they are frequently sold out, so if you don't see one you like, just ask.    USB Typewriter has been in business since June 2010, and since then has helped to rescue almost 1,000 typewriters, while constantly improving the conversion process to make it as easy as possible. The USB Typewriter has been featured by NPR's Morning Edition, The Martha Stewart Show, CNN HLN, WIRED, Gizmodo, and many others.  It was named one of the ""Top 10 iPad Accessories"" by PC Magazine.","Commerce and Shopping, Consumer Electronics, Hardware",1,Jack Zylkin,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Atma Links was designed as a user-friendly alternative to traditional in-text advertising.  Rather than inserting distracting and, often, irrelevant advertisements into text, Atma Links analyzes web content in real-time to identify references to online products in plain text.  Unambiguous references are automatically converted to deep affiliate links to retail sites which sell the product being linked.  As a supplemental service, Atma also automatically attaches affiliate codes to the regular links on a website that are eligible for affiliation.   The Atma Links overlay, or pop-up, was built to enhance the reading experience by displaying product specific information.  This product data includes up-to-date pricing info as well as multiple search options for the specific product being linked.  However,  publishers can elect to disable this feature and, instead, render the Atma Links presence on content site practically invisible.   Hover display is one of many customizable Atma Links features that empower publishers to control the in-text advertising on their websites.  With Atma Links, publishers also control the volume, display, and relevance of all affiliate links.   For product oriented forums, blogs, and web applications, Atma Links delivers significant in-text revenue while preserving user experience.","Advertising, Commerce and Shopping, Internet Services, Sales and Marketing",,,11-50,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
