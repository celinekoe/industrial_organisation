Their products are based on their patent-pending designs that incorporate next-generation optical, semiconductor and software technologies, delivering unprecedented capabilities and value.	 In today's challenging telecom market, IP service providers must watch every penny. Yet, to serve the growing number of businesses that access the Internet over dedicated circuits, service providers continue to fill their edge routers with expensive, underpowered WAN line cards. It's an unfortunate situation, but until now, there was no alternative. Venture-backed Seranoa Networks has taken a fresh look at the Internet edge. Founded and led by a cadre of successful serial entrepreneurs, Seranoa Networks has developed patent-pending technology that helps IP service providers get more from their edge routers. Seranoa's Edge Concentrators are a unique new approach to subscriber circuit aggregation that slashes price per port, multiplies edge router capacity, and enables automatic recovery from previously unrecoverable failures. Based on broadly supported standards, the Seranoa product family helps IP service providers use their existing edge routers to generate more revenue at less cost. To continue bringing these benefits to market, Seranoa Networks is expanding its team of best and brightest in the industry and has convened an advisory board of leading telecom experts. Together, these talented professionals are shaping the next generation of IP solutions for service providers. If you enjoy working in a team-oriented environment and want to help create exceptional products from the latest in hardware and software, Seranoa Networks is the place for you.","Community and Lifestyle, Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Information Technology, Internet Services, Other, Professional Services, Science and Engineering, Software",,,,2,M&A,24750000,USD,24750000,24750000,USD,24750000,"Advent International, St. Paul Venture Capital, FA Technology Ventures, YankeeTek Ventures, Schoffstall Ventures",,5,,Private,,,,,,

Bio Ethanol Fireplaces also burn much hotter than Terra Flame Home fireplaces, which limits their indoor use during hot months.
