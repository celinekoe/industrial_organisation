Whether you’re leasing your vehicle or buying it, the prospect of driving something new and with less miles should fill you with excitement and joy rather than reluctance and apprehension. Nevertheless, every day customers approach the leasing process with dread because they’re familiar with the logistics of the typical experience. Car Leasing Bronx is here to offer something entirely different and more rewarding. Our competitive prices, virtual shopping process, free delivery of your vehicle and next-level customer service are just a few of the factors that set us apart from other Bronx car lease dealers. When it comes time to lease your new car or truck, it’s imperative that you have a large and diverse inventory from which to choose. Car Leasing Bronx offers an enormous online inventory of the latest makes and models, providing the perfect vehicle for any kind of customer. We have close relationships with dealers all over the Bronx areas and we are ready to put our connections to work for you.  Let’s face it: car leasing doesn’t work for every type of driver. Some people drive their cars way too much to benefit from the leasing option. Others are wary of the process because they feel they’ll be hindered by unreasonable mileage-limitation agreements. At Car Leasing Bronx, you don’t have to be afraid of leasing. We offer convenient and affordable agreements that fit the needs and lifestyle of every lessee. We understand that circumstances change and that sometimes customers outgrow their leases. We aren’t looking to lock you into an agreement you can’t afford or that may not work for your changing lifestyle. When you’re getting ready to lease your next car or truck, you no longer have to worry about going to multiple dealerships and wasting valuable time and energy dealing with pushy sales professionals. Car Leasing Bronx offers online shopping, free delivery, the lowest prices in the area and a practically endless inventory of quality low-mileage vehicles. You don’t have to settle for an average or sub-par car leasing experience.","Commerce and Shopping, Transportation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Founded in the spring of 2007, ACCORD5 has grown from a small provider of website and graphic design services to a leading developer of web applications used by some of the world's largest businesses, organizations, and educational institutions. Aaron Draczynski and Chris Wallace-Mosher started ACCORD5 to help businesses and organizations develop an online identity, increase web presence, and build website traffic through their website development, graphic design and custom application design services. In the summer of 2007, ACCORD5 acquired an online helpdesk solution called Trellis Desk, with the intent of providing a robust and efficient way for businesses to offer customer support. Trellis Desk enables clients and companies to communicate and build relationships with each other; it is currently the company's flagship project. During the fall of 2007, ACCORD5 discontinued its website development and graphic design services, choosing to shift its attention towards the development of its own web applications. The company announced that several new projects were in development and would be launching the following year. In the summer of 2008, ACCORD5 introduced a new project called Groupthink, a repository of user-created customizations and add-ons for their Trellis Desk software product.

We are diligent, energetic, competitive, and team-centered. We believe our early success as a company revolves around the people we work with and their development. Our team is dynamic, coming from various backgrounds. Our common ground lies in our passion for growth and desire to raise the bar. For that reason, we like to describe our company as a leadership development firm that just happens to do sales. Our success has lead us to be fortunate enough to work with some of the leading telecommunications, solar, energy, satellite, cable, and internet firms and we’re only growing our client base. People may ask themselves, why do these name brand companies want to outsource their marketing? There are numerous reasons but the two ones we find most important are: time and money. In outsourcing their direct marketing team to Catalyst Endeavors, we lower the overhead cost for these firms. They no longer worry about recruiting costs, hiring and onboarding costs, training costs, retaining costs, and sales quotas. Catalyst Endeavors gives them back all the time and energy they would have spent to build their team. Now, instead of worrying about expanding their market share with a skilled and motivated sales team, they get to reinvest their time in building a better and newer product. Why do these companies trust us so much, though? Simple: they have seen our systems and strategies work first-hand and know how systematic our company truly is. We stay up-to-date on product knowledge, training methods, and leadership teachings, and instill our team with the skills to be their best. Instead of focusing our training strictly on getting the sale, we teach our people how to communicate effectively, actively listen, and assess the situation quickly with a level-head. Our goal as a company is to develop leaders who will impact their community. By shifting our focus on our people, our people shift their focus and look to deliver their best performance every day because they become personally invested in their results. The sales always follow.","Professional Services, Sales and Marketing",1,Steve Armstrong,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
