Building upon this experience, STM stepped to the industry forefront with its establishment of rural telephony satellite service businesses in several countries. Then again, responding to the growing opportunity to provide broadband and Internet access to unserved areas, STM introduced its powerful broadband, two-way satellite terminal in 1999.","Hardware, Mobile",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The state of small business marketing automation, for many business owners, is simply broken. Busy business owners don't have the money to hire expensive third-party consultants, nor do they have the technical know-how or marketing background to get value from existing solutions. This gap leaves a HUGE segment of SMBs without a way to reliably systemize their outreach efforts - in fact, only about 50% of SMBs in America are using a full featured marketing automation platform! By partnering with subject matter experts from specific verticals, UpLaunch can build and deploy turn-key solutions for business owners in those markets with an implementation time that is measured in hours, not weeks. All UpLaunch solutions manage the entire client life cycle and ship with business logic, content, and software 100% ready to go. Key elements can be customized by the business owner at their leisure. However, if the customer simply wants to get up and running as fast as possible, all they have to do is fill out a simple on-boarding questionnaire and the rest...well, it just simply works. UpLaunch is rapidly increasing accessibility to the power of marketing automation for the business owners who need it the most.

With licensed agents serving consumers in all 50 states and a technology-driven portfolio of value-added services for clients of all stripes, Simple Health is committed to cutting through the complex and often contradictory indicators that impede rational health insurance decisions and connecting underserved clients with plans that fit their needs and budgets. Launched in the early 2010s by Steve Dorfman in the wake of the Affordable Care Act rollout, Simple Health is built on a customer-first foundation. Simple Health’s intuitive plan search tools allow consumers to rapidly seek and find appropriate health plans. Plain-English descriptions coupled with user-friendly features make the notoriously confusing process manageable for everyday consumers. Simple Health’s health plan options include individual and family health insurance plans; group health insurance plans; short-term health insurance plans; and accidental, critical illness, and supplemental insurance plans. Individual and family health insurance plans are appropriate for single individuals who need to insure only themselves, as well as heads of household who wish to provide insurance for spouses and dependents outside the confines of an employer-based plan. Simple Health offers access to plans at a range of costs and coverage levels, from essentials-only options to gold-plated plans with low deductibles and generous coverage. Group health insurance plans offer the best of both worlds: a degree of flexibility and choice normally associated with individual plans combined with economies of scale normally associated with employer-based plans.  Short-term health insurance plans are essential for consumers who need to bridge gaps between jobs, prior to Medicare eligibility, or after aging off a parent’s insurance plan, among other situations. Simple Health helps customers make sense of the options available in their states and the specific use cases for which short-term health insurance may or may not be appropriate.  Accidental, critical illness, and supplemental health insurance plans are also known as high-deductible health plans (HDHPs). They’re appropriate for cost-conscious consumers willing to pay “first dollar” costs out of pocket until their deductibles are met. Since even healthy individuals can face unexpected, potentially catastrophic healthcare costs, these plans provide crucial peace of mind during the most productive years of life. Simple Health offers all these plan types through a network of expert agents licensed to provide insurance in all 50 states. Every Simple Health agent undergoes a rigorous training process that equips them to handle a vast array of situations. Unlike most health insurance marketplaces, Simple Health offers a people-driven experience designed to put healthcare consumers at ease during what’s often a confusing, chaotic time in their lives. Simple Health practices what it preaches. Founder Steve Dorfman is a vocal champion of gender equality in the workplace, a generous donor to causes close to his heart, and an ally to women and minority STEM professionals in Florida and beyond. In 2015, Dorfman was named a 40 Under 40: Top Young Entrepreneur by the South Florida Business Journal and selected as a finalist for its Insurance Industry Up and Comers list.

Post-closing shareholder representation is a complex, time-consuming, burdensome and unpredictable task and involves a commitment that can extend for years.  It requires a dedication of time and effort that most individuals cannot make.  If problems arise, the duties and responsibilities of the shareholder representative increase exponentially, and may even subject the representative to the risk of liability.  Shareholders are increasingly recognizing that it is a task they should not undertake and are looking for an alternative.  Fortis is the solution.   Fortis allows shareholders to outsource the burden, responsibility and risk of shareholder representation to professionals with the dedication, experience and expertise to serve that role.  We manage all aspects of the post-closing process, including escrows, holdbacks, working capital and other purchase price adjustments and earn-out/milestone payments.  Our services include shareholder reporting, accounting review of working capital and purchase price adjustments, account and distribution management and the audit of progress toward earn-out and milestone payments.  We handle all communications with the buyer, selling shareholders, escrow agents and other parties who might be involved in post-closing matters and coordinate the actions of each to ensure the process is seamless and efficient.  We tailor our services to each situation to make sure shareholder needs and expectations are fully met.","Financial Services, Media and Entertainment, Professional Services",2,"Adam Lezack, Rick Fink",1-10,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
