Craig Venter Institute is a world leader in genomic research. It was formed in October 2006 through the merger of several affiliated and legacy organizations â€” The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) and The Center for the Advancement of Genomics (TCAG), The J. Craig Venter Science Foundation, The Joint Technology Center, and the Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives (IBEA). Today all these organizations have become one large multidisciplinary genomic-focused organization. With more than 400 scientists and staff, more than 250,000 square feet of laboratory space, and locations in Rockville, Maryland and San Diego, California. For more than two decades Dr. J. Craig Venter and his research teams have been pioneers in genomic research. The revolution began in 1991 when at the National Institutes of Health Dr. Venter and his team developed expressed sequence tags (ESTs), a new technique to rapidly discover genes. Dr. Venter and his colleagues then started a new kind of not for profit research institute, The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR). With the freedom to pursue any number of exciting avenues in the burgeoning field of genomics, the team decided to use their new computing and computational tools, as well as new DNA sequencing technology, to sequence the first free living organism, Haemophilus influenzae in 1995. With this advance, the floodgates of genomics were opened. TIGR went on to sequence and analyze more than 50 microbial genomes. Dr. Venter and some from his team moved into mammalian genomics and sequenced some of the most important model organisms including the fruit fly, mouse and rat. The worldâ€™s attention was perhaps most keenly focused on the sequencing and analysis of one genome â€” the human â€” which was published in 2001 by Dr. Venter and his team at Celera Genomics. In the past three years teams have been engaged in some of the most fruitful and exciting research in the biological sciences. Weâ€™ve recently published the first diploid human genome and the initial results of our global ocean sampling expedition which uncovered more than six million new genes and thousands of new protein families from organisms found in sea water. Teams have also sequenced the microbial flora found in human environments such as the vagina, oral cavity and human gut. Weâ€™re making steady progress in our quest to create a synthetic chromosome and organism having successfully transformed one species of bacteria into another. Weâ€™ve also sequenced a variety of important infectious disease agents such as the mosquito species, Aedes aegypti, and we are working to understand the evolution of several viral genomes such as influenza and coronavirus in our quest to help alleviate the scourge of infectious disease around the world.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Other, Science and Engineering, Social Impact",1,J.

However, its approach is officially industry-agnostic, and its 150-strong team of payment processing professionals has the collective experience and expertise to serve SMBs in virtually any industry. The company’s website succinctly outlines its strategy: “to build payment processing solutions that work the first time, every time.” Talus Payments offers a slew of advantages that make its solutions and services particularly attractive to value-seeking SMB decision-makers. For starters, the company facilitates PIN-based debit card transactions, ACH and e-check transactions, gift card transactions, mobile wallet transfers and payments, and chip and magstripe credit card transactions. These capabilities are all directed with an eye toward increasing client revenue and operational efficiency while reducing burdens on internal accounts payable operations. All new Talus clients receive a Talus Pay Terminal free of charge. Unlike many processors, Talus chooses not to sell or lease equipment to new clients.  The focus is on making sure the client has the best equipment and service to meet their needs right out of the gate, and not on making a quick buck off of equipment. Additional terminals per account may require a monthly charge, but any cost is far below market and cover the administrative support for multiple devices. The Talus Pay Terminal can support EMV payment technologies and boasts a user-friendly interface that caters to non-technical employees and customers.  The Mobile Payments Reader is ideal for on-the-go payment processing. It’s small enough to fit in a pocket or side pouch and can operate anywhere with an Internet connection—perfect for food trucks, open-air markets, pop-up stores and other mobile businesses.

Sports referees currently rely on antiquated third-party referee schedulers to provide them with games to work. Similarly, sports organizations rely on the same referee schedulers to provide referees that are qualified to officiate their games. This approach has not been updated in decades as the referee industry continues to use outdated technologies and employment methods. The result has been a severe drop in the supply of referees while at the same time demand has increased. Our application, Refr Sports, will modernize the current system, providing referees and sports coordinators an efficient and effective tool for completing their respective duties. Refr Sports makes this a reality by offering a mobile application that supports both referees and sports organizers as end users. Our app delivers complete freedom to the users by allowing the sports organizations to post their game schedules along with officiating needs and offered compensation for each game. Referees can then see the ‘work order’, accept it, and be paid immediately after the game. The Refr platform makes money by taking a small service and processing fee on the payments we facilitate through the app. This business model is very similar to what has been successful in the food (DoorDash), transportation (Uber) and personal care (care.com) industries. Our Refr Team, made up of business, technical and sporting experience, has set out on a mission to create the platform that will turn the referee industry into a gig economy marketplace.

The founders of Atomicorp are industry recognized experts in the field of cyber security and prior to forming Atomicorp, were co-founders of Plesk and members of the Wheelgroup team that developed first commercial network intrusion detections system which was subsequently acquired by Cisco and made the basis for their IDS security offerings (see Management Team descriptions below). The Atomicorp team has pioneered a number of new approaches to security. They are the inventors of “Just in Time” or “Virtual” patching (JTIP). JITP is a method of developing virtual patches for applications before a vendor has released a security fix. JITP allows an end-user of the vulnerable application to continue to use it in a secure manner without needing to wait for the vendor to release an official patch. In many cases where JITP is properly deployed, the user may never need to patch the application. Atomicorp also pioneered methods such as layer 7 protocol scrubbing and the use of regular expression engines to simplify the creation of new signatures for Intrusion Detection systems. Another innovation of Atomicorp is distributed vulnerability assessments through light weight automatically deployed “dumb agents”, and later through direct remote-command control of systems.","Information Technology, Internet Services, Privacy and Security",2,"Michael Shinn, Scott Shinn",11-50,2,Seed,1050000,USD,1050000,1050000,USD,1050000,"Blu Venture Investors, MACH37",1,2,,Private,,,,,,
