This money helps athletes jump-start their careers, further their education, or relocate in pursuit of their lifelong goals. UBooster is the world’s premier platform for supporting college athletes. Through UBooster, fans Boost funds to demonstrate their support of the choices made by high school athletes. All the funds go to a trust fund (known as a UFund) for the athletes, which they can access at the end of their NCAA eligibility. Fans have the opportunity to participate for free by using the UBooster Points they receive at signup. These points directly correlate with the athletes’ Heat Index. To keep raising an athlete’s Heat Index, fans can Boost a player while simultaneously contributing money to their UFund, which also helps their favorite athlete’s Heat Index score climb. Additionally, when fans Boost an athlete they can select which school they support and each athlete’s profile will display the leading Boosters. For example, if a fan of School U boosts Joe Football for $10, Joe Football will receive 100 UBooster Points towards his Heat Index and his profile will display School U as the leading fan-driven institution. On National Letter of Intent (“Signing”) Day, the opportunity to Boost an athlete closes. All the funds donated to these athletes will be held in escrow until his or her NCAA eligibility expires. Athletes have six years to collect their funds, starting form the time they begin their college careers.","Education, Sports",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Through its accessible and in-depth approach ParaYoga develops exceptional practitioners and teachers who embody and/or are able to lead others into Yoga as it was originally envisioned––one of the most comprehensive, life-affirming, spiritual tradition ever created. The cornerstone of the ParaYoga curriculum is the ParaYoga Master Training (PYMT) program which is comprised of 10 trainings.  Based upon Yogarupa's 35 years of discipleship and practice, the PYMT has elevated the standard of YTT programs.  Its unique, systematic study and experience-based curriculum leads you to Yoga's true potential as one of the most comprehensive, life-affirming spiritual tradition ever created. Students wanting to deepen their personal practice, engage in the in-depth study of ancient wisdom, or simply for the purpose of self-development may participate in ParaYoga Master Trainings.  Of course, these trainings are also available as part of a fully comprehensive teacher training program, culminating in certification as a ParaYoga teacher.   The ParaYoga Master Training Certification Program (PYCP) takes most students a minimum of 2-3 years to complete. Over the course of the certification program, you will assimilate the teachings and begin to gain true depth of skill and self mastery both as a teacher and as a practitioner. Beyond our ParaYoga Certification Program, successful completion of the 10 ParaYoga Master Trainings culminates in a 300-hour Yoga Alliance certification, which, when combined with an existing 200-hour YA certification, credentials you at the YA 500-hour level.",,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
