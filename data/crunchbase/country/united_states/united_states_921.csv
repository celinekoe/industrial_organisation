Preference management provides the opportunity to ""just ask"" your customers and prospects for their interests as well as preferred channel(s) of communication. Forrester Research indicates that 77% of consumers say companies should let them decide how a company communicates with them — making preference management an even wiser investment. And, preference management is even more relevant in B2B marketing because the lifetime value of the customer relationship is generally higher. Preference management helps marketers avoid the corporate mailroom concept where all communications (print and digital) are delivered to the same contact — whether for billing, promotional offers or special events.

In the past, organizations would leverage Excel and PowerPoint to create management reports for their executive teams.  They might be using the Balanced Scorecard, KPIs, OKRs, or other frameworks to track their strategy and key objectives, but they still need to create informative, well-structured reports for their executive teams.   Eventually organizations outgrow Excel and PowerPoint.  There is a huge gap between these desktop applications and a full BI or ERP solution.  The enterprise applications cost millions and require years to configure.  The IT departments becomes the bottleneck to reporting and the output from these applications still needs to be reformatted for executive consumption.  The polishing occurs back in Excel or PowerPoint. ClearPoint closes this gap.  As an easy to use, but very powerful SaaS reporting engine, ClearPoint allows organizations to create the reports they need without additional work.  Business users control report KPIs, templates and reports.  Multiple people can work simultaneously in the same report.  Charts, formulas, and data can be managed by business users without waiting days for IT departments to react. ClearPoint is the future of management reporting.  The team has the business acumen and technical capabilities to meet our customer needs and grow with demand.  We have built both a scalable infrastructure and support team to meet demand now and in the future.  ClearPoint leverages its API to pull data from multiple applications, and its flexibility allows reports to be structured for multiple audiences leveraging the same data sets.   With ClearPoint, your Board reports, Executive Leadership Team, and Department reports can all come from the same application.  There is one version of the truth, accessible from any device.  And for public sector organizations, this information can be published to public websites as well.

ROMAD's patented Malware Genetic Sequencing™ technology enables us to identify, analyze, and stop in real time entire viral ""families"", as opposed to specific strains or individual variants. This ability allows reliable, sustained detection and diffusion of a wide range of malware threats. We detect what OTHERS MISS – because we’re not stuck in the perpetual arms race with malware developers, passively looking for their next creation just to figure out how to catch it next time. We detect BEFORE others can – because we’re not waiting to analyze the new variant as a prerequisite to detection.  Derivative strains and variants are just that - derivative. Our patent-pending family-based detection profiles let us cover the vast majority of derivatives on-the-fly. We detect with the LEAST AMOUNT OF OVERHEAD, both on our team and on your endpoint – because unlike legacy platforms, we don’t need millions of individual static signatures to match the hundreds of thousands of derivative strains and variants created every day. We detect WHERE others cannot – our Malware Genetics™ and dynamic threat response technology allows ROMAD to sustain detection capability virtually in perpetuity. Isolated industrial deployment scenarios such as SCADA, ICS, and IoT environments where updates are infrequent, yet viral threats prevalent (think Stuxnet model), are a perfect place for ROMAD endpoint threat detection and response capabilities. We DISRUPT the criminal malware economic model by eliminating the critical time-to-detection gap – the opportunity to monetize the malware before detection is developed by legacy static-signature platforms. We eliminate the economic incentive for malware writers, kit builders, and bot herders, thereby contributing to the elimination of the vast majority of profit-driven malware presently in the wild. Legacy anti-virus companies, dominated by outdated thinking and outmoded malware detection methods, chase their tales as they keep growing their analyst teams and bloating their signature sets into the hundreds of millions. Then there’s ROMAD: an elegant, truly innovative, and uniquely capable platform specifically designed from the ground-up to address the actual root cause of the malware epidemic – the criminal malware economic model.","Hardware, Information Technology, Privacy and Security, Science and Engineering, Software",3,"Eugene Melinyk, Serhiy Loshak, Vladimir Grytsan",11-50,5,Seed,2500000,USD,2500000,3685652,USD,3685652,EASME - EU Executive Agency for SMEs,,1,,Private,,,,,,
