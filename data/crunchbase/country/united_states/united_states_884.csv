We then pay you 100% of the money your music makes in royalties every six months. Since 2010 we’ve been running the progressive house record label Gold Shore Records. Within this time we’ve received hundreds if not thousands of demos from talented artists around the world that didn’t fit our genre or weren’t up to the very high standard of mastering our genre requires. In 2011 I received an excellent trance demo, which was shared with us and 72 other labels on Soundcloud, trance not being our genre I left it for the other guys and tried to buy it a few weeks later on iTunes. Turns out this track never got signed, and still hasn’t been. This didn’t make much sense to me, and when we started asking around we found out that hundreds of these demos weren’t making it onto labels because they didn’t fit the genre or weren’t produced by David Guetta. Now, we know from running a label that times are tough in the music world but it seems silly to not have a platform to sell your music just because there’s not a label to take you on. This is even worse for bands and non-dance music musicians, the major labels have the commercial sound so nailed down you either have to be ground breaking or hooked up to get a contract, and even they don’t always sell well. If a label does accept you, you’re going to take a hefty hit on the royalties to be part of them, as we well know. You can release through an open source distributor but the monthly subscriptions or one off release costs are through the roof! So we asked ourselves, what does the band or producer do who has fans, friends and family who want to buy their music? Other than hosting their music on Soundcloud, not much was the answer. So we created Fivermusic, an easy and fair way to turn your musical masterpieces from an audio file into cash. We don’t charge you $70 a month to host your songs on dodgydownload.com, we send your music out to the biggest download stores around the world, including iTunes, Amazon and Google. We make sure that every track is embellished with your personal metadata so your fans and more can find you in an instant, complete with your album art, artist and song names and genre. Then when the royalties come rolling in, we don’t take 50% and bath in cash, we give you every last penny that the distributors send our way.","Commerce and Shopping, Media and Entertainment, Mobile, Music and Audio",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

We are diligent, energetic, competitive, and team-centered. We believe our early success as a company revolves around the people we work with and their development. Our team is dynamic, coming from various backgrounds. Our common ground lies in our passion for growth and desire to raise the bar. For that reason, we like to describe our company as a leadership development firm that just happens to do sales. Our success has lead us to be fortunate enough to work with some of the leading telecommunications, solar, energy, satellite, cable, and internet firms and we’re only growing our client base.  People may ask themselves, why do these name brand companies want to outsource their marketing? There are numerous reasons but the two ones we find most important are: time and money. In outsourcing their direct marketing team to South Matrix, we lower the overhead cost for these firms. They no longer worry about recruiting costs, hiring and onboarding costs, training costs, retaining costs, and sales quotas. South Matrix gives them back all the time and energy they would have spent to build their team. Now, instead of worrying about expanding their market share with a skilled and motivated sales team, they get to reinvest their time in building a better and newer product.  Why do these companies trust us so much, though? Simple: they have seen our systems and strategies work first-hand and know how systematic our company truly is. We stay up-to-date on product knowledge, training methods, and leadership teachings, and instill our team with the skills to be their best. Instead of focusing our training strictly on getting the sale, we teach our people how to communicate effectively, actively listen, and assess the situation quickly with a level-head. Our goal as a company is to develop leaders who will impact their community. By shifting our focus on our people, our people shift their focus and look to deliver their best performance every day because they become personally invested in their results.

Nobody likes to think about the inevitability of their passing and leaving loved ones behind—and it’s understandable. Life is filled with joyous moments and events that we don’t want to miss. Travel, graduation, birthdays, marriage, children—we want to be a part of it all. And it’s not just celebratory events that keep us from letting mortality enter our thoughts. Day to day happenings can also absorb our time and attention. Dental appointments, grocery shopping, soccer practice, car payments—on any given day, life gives us more than enough to fret and fuss over. The reality is, however, that life eventually comes to an end, and when it does, we no longer have a say over what happens to the people and things we’ve left behind. Even with knowledge of the fact that they won’t be around forever, many people still put off planning for the inevitable. They think it will create more worries and more stress for them, but actually an estate planning attorney in New York would get your affairs in order for you and relieve you of any anxieties you may have about what will happen to your finances and assets in the future.

It’s no secret: hiring talent & finding a job is broken. The resume to job application process worked in the 70’s when people snail-mailed resumes, but that was a long time ago. Many industries have gone through a digital rebirth, but recruiting is still stuck in the Stone Age. We are on the verge of a revolution in the talent space, and  have pioneered a better way for people to find their next opportunity while playing within the existing hiring ecosystem. Imagine Pandora(tm), but a platform that instead matches talent with companies.   Once companies of interest are identified, our technology then finds jobs within those companies that fit the individual. Our dedicated team of talent agents works first and foremost with the seeker, and has access to a huge network of companies via our extremely unique business model. We are working hard to combine personal relationships and custom-created technology into a new way to get hired. It's a refreshing approach to talent acquisition that is long past due, and just makes sense.","Administrative Services, Information Technology, Internet Services, Professional Services, Software",1,Eric Harvey,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
