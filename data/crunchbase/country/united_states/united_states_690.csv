The end-to-end software includes the following features: purchase orders management, inventory management, warehouse management, sales channel management, order management, and business intelligence. In addition to this, our software has the unique capability of processing customer returns. Returns management is the process of taking returned/distressed inventory and recapturing its lost value. Through data-driven metrics, our system is capable of helping you make the best decision to maximize recovery. In addition to this, it allows resellers to store their inventory in a variety of conditions (i.e. new, used, refurbished, open box). Our goal is to help resellers make smarter decisions when processing customer returns. The key objective is working to improve productivity in the reseller’s operations and warehouses. Our system will provide a step-by-step guide of where to begin once a return enters their warehouse. When a customer returns an item, there is a loss of profit that must be taken into account to maintain a high standard of customer satisfaction. However, our program will be beneficial to many resellers by recapturing some of that lost value. In addition to this, resellers can adjust the software to their unique business needs. They will be able to modify the software in a way that best suits their business such as how they want to process returns, ship out orders, and select specific sales channels they want to be present on. Lastly, we believe in creating a new norm that values social responsibility and sustainability. Resellers will find a better way to reprocess their returns instead of sending them into landfills where waste will continue to increase and cause harm to our environment.","Commerce and Shopping, Information Technology, Internet Services, Software",1,Dennis Hoang,1-10,1,,,,,,USD,,MassChallenge,1,1,,Private,,,,,,
