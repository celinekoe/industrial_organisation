Here is another one: FedEx does not employ the driver of that truck.  FedEx subcontracts with companies like ours to deliver packages to people’s homes.  Companies like ours are the ones that buy the trucks and hire the drivers to deliver the packages.  “Okay, but what does that mean to me?” you are probably wondering.  District Delivery is an independent contractor that has an agreement to deliver packages for FedEx Home Delivery for certain routes in the Greater Washington, DC metropolitan area, specifically including the near Virginia suburbs including, Alexandria, Va. We employ 14 drivers and have 14 trucks. In the off-peak season we deliver approximately 7500 per week. In peak season volume increases by approximately 200 - 300% and we will employ 24 drivers and will have 24 trucks. Like other multiple route owners, we are eligible for certain monthly and quarterly bonuses which can add as much as 15 - 20 % to our income. We have two main ways to expand our business and increase our revenue – maintaining an excellent record of timely and safe delivery of packages and acquiring additional routes.  In our business, we are rated by FedEx on our ability to deliver packages in a timely, effective and safe manner.  If we are successful in doing so, we will be eligible for certain monthly and quarterly bonuses.  In the aggregate, those bonuses can be significant.  In addition, maintaining a timely, effective and safe delivery record puts us in a position to acquire additional delivery routes, if and when they become available.  Currently, we are seeking investment capital in order to acquire additional routes that are, or soon will be, available.","Administrative Services, Transportation",1,Trevor Smith,11-50,1,,680000,USD,680000,680000,USD,680000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Bizofit's Open Innovation platform enables enterprises to discover and connect with startups on a ""globally curated"" platform. The platform also helps enterprises and startups to collaborate and build solutions. Via Bizofit / Innovation HQ platform, Enterprises post Innovation Challenges and Business Problems and crowdsource Ideas and Innovative solutions. Tech companies use the platform to reach CXOs and generate ""Digital"" Leads. The platform is designed to help Enterprise CXOs crowdsource Innovative Ideas and Solutions, and to operationalize Ideation and Innovation. Focus areas are Digital Technologies, but the Platform can be really used in any organization to seek and submit ideas / solutions.  Employees, ecosystem partners i.e. customers or vendors, or anyone can send you ideas and solutions, depending on your preferences. Every user is validated through his/her LinkedIn profile. The Technology companies on the Platform are curated, and Ideas and Solutions are vetted. Tech companies can use the Platform to generate Leads, if Enterprises are interested in their Ideas / Solutions. Several cool features like 'Like', Thumbs down, Forward and Replies are included. Some of the upcoming features include Rating of Ideas, and much more. Other features include the ability to Identify, Evaluate, and Select Technology Solutions through our proprietary 4P SUGAR Quadrant Framework. SUGAR stands for ""Specialized User Generated Aggregate Rating"". Only Customers and Analysts rate companies and solutions on the Platform. Bizofit was launched by IT Services industry veteran Bala Palamadai to disrupt the Technology space, by challenging the Status Quo – based on Legacy sourcing approaches, Legacy Service Providers and Legacy engagement models – that resulted in sub-optimal solutions, huge costs and limited adoption of Transformational solutions in several organizations. Identifying a new Technology vendor takes up to nine months – an unacceptably high time frame in today’s world. Also, a little-known fact is that new customer acquisition often costs as high as 20-30% of revenues for IT Service Providers, a cost which ultimately is borne by Enterprise Customers.  Through adoption of its Platform, Bizofit seeks to eliminate these inefficiencies and reduce costs, and most importantly present Enterprises with Transformational & Innovative Digital Solutions.

With a focus on innovation, comfort, and rehabilitation, Allure works closely with hospitals to enhance clinical services and reduce readmission rates. The Allure Group’s unique approach to community care provides one-of-a-kind services and spaces based on cultural needs.   Founded in 2011, The Allure Group began, as many companies do, as a solution to a problem. When caring for his elderly grandfather, CEO Joel Landau noticed deficiencies in New York City’s eldercare field: specifically, a lack in resources needed by residents to live happy, comfortable lives. Landau saw in these failing nursing homes not a dead end, but an opportunity for New York’s ailing and aging seniors. When Victory Memorial Hospital was on the brink of closure in 2010, Landau and his partners acquired the center and transformed it into Hamilton Park Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, which now enjoys a 98% occupancy rate. The success of the Victory acquisition led the budding company, which recruited the talented Melissa Powell to head operations, to acquire two more non-profit homes in 2011 and 2012. What was once the Ruby Weston Manor became the Linden Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation, and the Marcus Garvey Residential Rehab Pavilion became the Crown Heights Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation. Heavy investments in these facilities elevated their care and quality to a new level. The centers now enjoy a 100% and 98% occupancy rate respectively, and CMS Five Star ratings as of 2016.   Today, The Allure Group manages six centers across Manhattan and Brooklyn, NY, adding to its network the Bedford Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation, the Harlem Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation, and the King David Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation. With the appearance and amenities of 5-star hotels, we cater to the unique needs of the communities in which we serve. With programs like the Longevity Gardens for Chinese seniors, Salud Latina for Latino seniors, bilingual staff members, as well as specialty services for patients with dementia and Alzheimer's, we keep our residents comfortable and safe.   We adhere to a set of values that inform our every decision in Allure centers. These include respect for the dignity of both residents and colleagues, compassion for patients and one another, honesty in all forms of communication, and integrity in our behavior, actions, methods, and principles.   The Allure Group’s one-stop centers, which seek to eliminate the “revolving door” nature of many rehab facilities, are designed to support the growing needs of the aging Baby Boomer generation. By creating spaces that are attentive to the needs of residents when it comes to their health, comfort, culture, and quality of life, Allure’s interdisciplinary team cultivates an environment where patients can thrive. The entire team at Allure is committed to leveraging well-grounded healthcare operating experience and industry knowledge to develop solutions that lead to improved health care quality and access, while still being affordable for all.   Under COO Melissa Powell’s tutelage, the Allure Group is constantly pursuing innovation in the industry. They are market leaders in Cardiac Rehabilitation and Pulmonary Rehabilitation, and have developed a unique NP approach to reduce readmission rates. With technologies like AlterG, an anti-gravity treadmill, and hydrotherapy, patients benefit from exclusive high-tech treatments before they are adopted by other facilities. Allure is currently exploring telemedicine and robotics, among other exciting technological innovations.   At The Allure Group, our greatest strengths are the hard work and dedication of our clinical and support staff, who help drive quality and improvement in eldercare every day. Caring for people in their time of need and expanding access for seniors is what we do best and find truly rewarding.",Health Care,1,Joel Landau,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The company’s Syntho-Glass® system has proven to be reliable enough for the U.S. Navy, the Coast Guard, and international natural gas and oil industry conglomerates to require Syntho-Glass® availability for all pipe repairs. Founded in 1982, NRI developed its pipe repair systems for application within the marine industry. As the original inventors of the moisture-cured, pre-impregnated composite material, NRI caught the attention of the U.S. Navy and, in 1996, secured its first contract with the U.S. government requiring NRI’s Syntho-Glass® system to be carried aboard all Navy vessels. The company’s success with the U.S. Navy led to the creation of larger and more robust materials. This expansion of its product capabilities allowed for the exploration of opportunities within the natural gas and oil industries. NRI focused on further developing its original product to specifically address the pipe repair and reinforcement challenges within those unique industries. With its focus on development, NRI experienced substantial success and growth, requiring a move to a new facility in 2009. Since that time, the company has tripled in size and revenues as the demand for its solutions continues to grow. To support this demand, NRI has introduced an average of one new product per year over the last four years, with each product focusing on the company’s participation in the evolution of leak repair and pipe reinforcement.","Government and Military, Manufacturing, Transportation",,,11-50,1,M&A,,USD,,,USD,,Palm Beach Capital,1,1,,Private,,,,,,
