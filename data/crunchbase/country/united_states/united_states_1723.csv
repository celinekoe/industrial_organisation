New Mousetrap! Half the installation time!! The Easy2Install switch and outlet system is the Professional and Do It Yourself solution. The system consists of combined face plate and switch or outlet units which include prewire connections to the switches by connector rail and standard terminal connection plugs. The Easy2Install electrical connection system is all incorporated into the faceplate, covered for safety and labeled for the easy install in minutes. Wiring a home or room with the Easy2Install unit is as easy as it gets for the beginners and professionals and most important you reduce install time. The faceplate Includes an easy peel off, paint mask. The system is manufactured of quality fire retardant materials and components, all standard to the industry. The pressure on electrical contractors today to be competitive and faster on the job with quicker completion dates is standard in the industry today. Most electrical contractors are being forced to pre-build the back box and wire connections ( top picture ) in the back of their warehouses across America. Then they ship to the job site to help with reaching ever shortening deadlines for project completion. The problem is their still spending excessive man hours to pre-build the back box in the back of the warehouse and possibly shipping twice. Therefor it's costing more money for the 2 step process and then they still have to install the switches and receptacles in a fast paced environment. That's were Easy2Install, LLC helps the electrical contractor save time/steps by decreasing the installation process. Our all in 1 pre-assembled multi combination switch system is prebuilt at the factory and is delivered as a 1 piece unit that only requires attaching the wire circuits and fastening directly to the back box. The face plate, switches, receptacles, jumpers and protective backing with screw in terminals are pre-assembled at the factory ( looking for manufacturing investors ). We also include an easy peel off paint mask to keep our switches clean during painting. We understand change takes time but TIME IS MONEY! So, that brings us to the million dollar question. 50 years with no new mousetrap like top photo or new time saving mousetrap like Easy2Install's all in 1 pre-assembled switch system. You be the judge. UL classify's as ( New and Innovative )! Because the switches are already UL approved, we believe UL certification is inevitable for our products.
