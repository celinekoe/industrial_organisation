It's a media planning SaaS for small and medium-sized companies. The purpose of this easy-to-follow SaaS is to help businesses to plan their advertising appearances. The target users are not media agencies, but rather it is intended for marketers working for all kinds of businesses. More precisely it is for marketers wishing to advertise. Our product is location-dependent more than it is linguistically-dependent simply because the media database will only be useful if it is relevant to that location's market. It's a subscription-based model which can be paid for either on a yearly or monthly basis. Aplanky.com was launched in May 2015. Up to this point the total number of demo users who have tried Adplanky have exceeded 300. We currently have 30 annual-based customers. Up to this point nobody has taken advantage of our monthly subscription. We have been using a test price model of 20 USD per month and 200 USD per year. We have grown the company so far without the use of advertising campaigns or any marketing, instead we soft launched the product by the use of P.R. Although the website is currently not in English, you will be able to gauge a good understanding of the SaaS by visiting this link: www.adplanky.com/bemutato. Now we are focusing our attention on product useability. The CEO of Adplanky started his career as a media planner and buyer in a media agency 16 years ago. After that he worked as an online marketing consultant and trainer for Fortune 500 companies. He launched Adplanky because he saw a gap in the international market for an easy-to-use media planning SaaS for small companies. We have been approached by one investor, but it was decided at this point in time not to proceed. Everthing is run on a shoestring budget. The majority of our staff work remotely. Along with the CEO, who works with marketing  tasks, there is also a CTO and one programmer along with a support manager, currently in Hungary. Whichever country our product reaches, we will always look to have staff located within the borders of said country.","Sales and Marketing, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
