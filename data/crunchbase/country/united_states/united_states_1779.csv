"Kansas Counselors, Inc.",https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/kansas-counselors-2,"Collection Agency, Consulting, Financial Services","Lenexa, Kansas, United States",Kansas Counselors is an accounts receivable management firm established in 1960.,"639,197",Midwestern US,$1M to $10M,Active,1960-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,http://kcikc.com/,"Established in 1960 in Lenexa, Kansas, Kansas Counselors, Inc. has become one of the industry leaders in successful debt collection.  The company was founded on the belief that most people want to pay their debts on time, but personal or financial hardships sometimes interfered with that goal.  Unlike other collections agencies, the company takes the time to offer financial advice and counseling services to the consumer, working toward resolving the overdue payments on behalf of the company’s many creditor clients.  The care and compassion KCI uses when dealing with consumers helps them stand apart from other collection agencies, which are often known for heavy-handed tactics. Five decades of debt collection experience have given the experts at KCI the tools and techniques needed to secure outstanding debt for their clients.   The company offers a host of useful services for their customers, including state-of-the art collection tools and the ability to handle legal action or litigation if needed. A range of online tracking tools and dedicated client liaisons are other ways that KCI approaches the business of collecting bad debt differently than other firms.  The company believes that working with debtors rather than against them serves the purpose of being able to collect debts faster, improving revenue for the creditor and helping to reduce the consumer stress sometimes involved in debt collection. The process begins for creditor clients when they submit a listing of customer accounts with outstanding balances to KCI.  Next, a first collection notice is generated for each customer as required by law.  Along with the first collection notice letter, information is provided to the customer to contact KCI to discuss the accounts in question.  If the customer does not call within a specified time frame, usually 7-10 business days, outbound collection efforts commence. KCI handles debt collection very seriously, making up to 20000 telephone calls every day in an attempt to secure as many outstanding payments as possible.  This approach gives customers more opportunities to make contact with the debt collection staff.  In every customer interaction, amicable solutions are found to help resolve the outstanding accounts quickly and painlessly. Since some customers will continue to avoid paying their debts, KCI can employ other powerful tools for its creditor clients, including listing the account with the major credit bureaus like Equifax and Experian.  Legal action up to and including litigation is a final option, and KCI’s staff attorneys have decades of experience in resolving difficult debt cases. With their award-winning debt collection practices, KCI also offers a range of other services, including: Self-Pay Early-Out – the company can make contact with overdue account holders quickly, resolving issues before full-scale collection efforts every have to be employed.  This proactive approach saves clients the expense of writing off bad debt or engaging in pricey debt collection practices. Payment Monitoring – KCI’s professional customer service and debt recovery teams take the hassle out of monitoring outstanding debt payments, working as an extension of the client’s own business office.  Automated reminders and regular follow-ups are part of the package. Accounts Receivables Clean-Up – KCI stands ready to help its clients with lagging accounts receivables projects.  This saves money, allowing the client to focus on new revenue streams rather than expending effort chasing down bad debt. Client Workshops – The experts at KCI strive to stay ahead of industry trends and regulatory changes.  These collections professionals can instruct clients on best practices, developing their own collections strategies, and navigating the confusing world of debt collection regulations.  This instruction comes in the form of education seminars and workshops. Second Placements – sometimes, clients have used other collection agencies in an attempt to collect bad debt, with less-than-satisfactory results.  KCI prides itself on its ability to recover debts even from accounts that have been worked before, employing advanced skip-tracing techniques and customized contact tools to track down debtors.  These methods maximize debt collection for creditor clients, achieving some of the best clearance rates in the industry. KCI has built its reputation on its ability to recover outstanding debts, even under difficult circumstances.  By treating consumers with the dignity they deserve, they have discovered that this approach pays big dividends in resolving outstanding accounts amicably.  The company’s many creditor clients agree that KCI’s methods help it stand above its many competitors in the debt collection field. The company’s track record of reasonable service fees and recovery rates that outpace national averages are icing on the cake.  50 years of experience and the knowledge that comes with those years makes KCI the ideal choice for debt collection and counseling services for creditors nationwide.","Administrative Services, Financial Services, Professional Services",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
