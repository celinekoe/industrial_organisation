Space exploration is on the verge of a new era. Soon, the Artemis program will bring humans back to the moon. Crewed missions to Mars will follow, moving humanity closer to becoming a multi-planetary species. Pushing towards this next frontier, we are deeply curious about the questions that will arise and the transformative potential that will touch the lives of all of us. While there are extreme technological challenges, we will equally be challenged by questions about how to live beyond our home planet. This includes questions of culture, identity, consciousness, and the everyday mundane experience of being human. Barrelhand is exploring these questions by creating products that are uniquely designed to meet the requirements of human life in space. We understand ourselves as a platform for innovation that is open to technologists, scientists and artists who are prepared to bring their insights towards this mission. Our journey started in 2014 with a limited edition timepiece called Project One, which explored and demonstrated the potential of additive manufacturing (3D-printing) for mechanical watchmaking. More than a watch, Project One has been a pioneer and research outlet for an upcoming technology that offers vast, yet largely unrealized potential. At the moment, we are developing our next-generation product line and infrastructure, which will include an array of cutting-edge technologies and insights to meet the harsh requirements of space. We invite everyone to join this journey - whether you are an astronaut flying to space or someone at home looking towards the dreams and promises of the starry night.","Data and Analytics, Design, Hardware, Manufacturing, Science and Engineering, Software, Transportation",2,"Karel Bachand, Michael Sorkin",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
