Enter CRAM, a revolutionary digital security platform that offers online and offline data delivery combined with unbreachable offsite storage. CRAM's unrivaled storage capability with their proprietary security make it a highly differentiated platform from any in the market. With several patents pending, CRAM pushes not just digital security into a new frontier, but represents a complete shift in the technology paradigm. The CRAM security platform allows users to backup and share data in two revolutionary new ways. The first is using CRAM's patent-pending BitBursting™ and Multi-Cloud™ online storage. The second is a totally offline solution that utilizes CRAM's patent-pending intrusion detection system at the device level and offline drive based data delivery (Sneakernet). Never has so much data been so accessible yet so safe. Components of the CRAM security platform implement Department of Defense NSA Type 1 security and both CRAM solutions exceed the United States Governments NIST Level 4 security. Accordingly, CRAM eliminates digital piracy and appeals to even the most risk-averse company that has become afraid of the Internet. Because of this, CRAM will serve as an application platform in any industry where content creation, security, transport and sharing are critical.

One of the most effective ways to improve the pharmacokinetic properties of a bioactive compound is the introduction of a fluorine-containing functional group. Fluorinated substituents have been shown to improve lipid solubility, receptor binding, metabolic stability, and bioavailability, which can dramatically improve the performance of a potential drug. The company’s first product is a new, shelf-stable reagent for trifluoromethylation, allowing the derivatization of a broad range of compounds with a CF3 group under mild conditions. Catylix plans to expand the chemistries it practices to include additional chemical functionality that improves the properties of compounds targeted for the pharmaceutical and crop protection markets.
