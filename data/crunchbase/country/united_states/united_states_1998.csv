We deliver in-person, hands-on and interactive training workshops to better equip you and your employees to work effectively and efficiently in the modern workplace. Let’s face it—online HR training might check the compliance boxes, but online learning often fails to deliver a lasting impact. It takes well presented, in-person HR training to actually change the minds and habits of your managers, supervisors, and employees. The result? Lasting, transformative change in your company culture. Bringing in an outside expert has outsized benefits. HR issues are sometimes quite sensitive, and we bring 25 years of broad HR experience to your company. Because we’re not in a management or an HR position at your company, we’re ideally positioned to deliver workshops that cut through the noise to effect real, measurable change on even the most entrenched HR problems you face. Available 24/7 Our primary background is in manufacturing and construction. We know that not everyone works 8–5.  Training sessions can be scheduled anytime that suits your schedule, including middle of the night or on any shift.

By eliminating the skill gap, Investment Banking University creates a place where students and professionals can secure their career in investment banking It's unique because the university is entirely dedicated to front office skills like coverage, origination, and deal making rather than deal support skills like financial modeling and valuation.

The big benefit is that it helps students and professionals define a path to building a career in investment banking rather than simply pursuing the 80 hours a week analyst route. This helps them avoid interviewing for a job having never done the actual work. Investment Banking University makes it easy for students and professionals to learn front office investment banking skills in order to build a career in investment banking or launch their own investment bank.
