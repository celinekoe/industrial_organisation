C&H Taxi,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/c-h-taxi-3,Transportation,"Charleston, West Virginia, United States",C&H Taxi has brought innovation and trustworthiness to the public transportation industry in Charleston WV for nearly 30 years,"845,297",Southern US,Less than $1M,Active,1982-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,http://www.chtaxi.com/,"C&H Taxi has been serving the city of Charleston, West Virginia and surrounding communities for over 30 years.  In that time, the company has positioned itself as one of the most innovative cab service companies in the state.  By adding valuable features to its website and mobile tools, providing unparalleled service to the residents of the city, and by giving back to the community, C&H Taxi demonstrates its commitment to the future. The company was founded in 1981 by partners Tom Craft and Cletus Hanley, whose initials grace the company’s name. In 1982, the Corey family purchased the growing taxi business and have been operating it ever since.  At their 30-year anniversary, the company celebrated the fact that they operate the city’s longest continually-running cab service in history. During their decades in the cab business, the company innovated constantly, building brand recognition as they rose in popularity.  For example, in 1984 the company purchased 12 diesel-powered French Peugeot vehicles to replace the Fords they had been using.  This move served to increase business within the city of Charleston and helped customers recognize the flashy cars.  The company was also the first cab company in the area to have air-conditioning units installed in their taxis. These days, the company operates 27 vehicles throughout the city, with over 65 employees handling all aspects of the daily operations, including driving, booking, and administrative tasks.  It is still a family-run business, with the younger generations of the Corey family stepping in to provide new direction and opportunities for the ever-growing company. C&H now innovates in the for-hire vehicle industry by incorporating state-of-the-art features on its website.  Area residents can now book taxi trips directly through the company’s site, adding a level of convenience that other cab companies simply do not offer.  The simple website interface is easy to use and helps the company dispatch cabs quickly and effortlessly.  Of course, city residents can still call the company to speak to a customer care representative who will handle all arrangements courteously and professionally.  One of the advanced features of the telephone service is the company’s groundbreaking automated booking system, which looks at past users’ trip histories to offer the option of being picked up at a destination used previously.  This feature saves time and adds a level of convenience not possible at other cab companies.  Perhaps the most exciting feature C&H offers its customers is its mobile phone app, compatible with Apple and Android phones.  This app, called “Link”, lets customers hail a cab from wherever they are.  It also has a feature to let customers know if a cab is in the vicinity. It gives customers the option to track their trips on a map, pay for services, and choose a particular driver or vehicle, too. As a locally-owned and operated company, C&H holds community involvement as one of its core values. This is why they’ve sought to give back to the people of Charleston, the very people who made the cab service a success for over 30 years. Perhaps their biggest contribution to the welfare of city residents is their Intoxi-Taxi ® program.  This program is provided for several concerts and civic events every calendar year, and offers free or low-cost taxi service for people that have had too much to drink.  It helps keep drunk drivers off the roads of Charleston and gets people home safely.  C&H has also expanded its service to disabled passengers by outfitting the taxi fleet with two specially-designed wheelchair-accessible vans.  The company calls this service their Wave Program, and the service can be booked over the phone or online just like their other expert cab services.  In an effort to reduce the company’s carbon footprint and to improve air quality within the city, the company has also added two Toyota Prius hybrid vehicles to the fleet.  This Ecoride program has been a hit with city residents who appreciate the company’s initiative to make the city a better place to live. A special project undertaken by the company has been their popular PINK Ride Program.  C&H painted one of their cabs bright pink, and donated $1.00 to breast cancer research initiatives for every ride taken in this specially-decorated taxi.  With the program completed, the company was able to donate thousands of dollars.  The company has plans to outfit more vehicles with interesting color schemes to build awareness and to raise money for charitable causes.  These are but a few of the ways that Charleston’s longest-running taxi company has given back to the people of the city, and C&H will continue to innovate ways to improve their service in years to come.",Transportation,,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
