Egbuchulam, as a sole proprietorship, is a start-up company that will be selling/distributing my new patented product Bell Boards.   Ever since I was a kid I loved to skateboard.  I use to take my skateboard everywhere because I found it cool, fun and exciting.  But I realized it wasn't an easy activity to do. As I got older, I started minimizing the use of my skateboard because it became less about it being cool or fun, and more about the most feasible way to get from place to place.  That is where a bicycle beats a skateboard.  It is a lot easier to ride a bike than to skateboard.   That's why more people ride bikes around the world.  When I came up with the idea of my company and product I wanted to create a new product line of skateboards that are as easy to ride as riding a bike, because there is a safer and more comfortable feeling biking than skateboarding.  I came up with the product, the Bell Boards.  Bell Boards are the only skateboards of its kind that combines the safety and comfort of a bike with the thrill of skateboarding. My company, Bell Boardz, offer types of skateboards whose primarily goal is to emulate that feeling of biking while skateboarding, that easiness.  With its dumbbell structure, foam padding, and ball wheels the Bell Boards offer THE easier alternative to traditional skateboarding without compromising the excitement.  My company is still in the developing phase so there is still some nooks and crannies that need to be worked out.  With room to expand the product line, such as room for additional products, multiple styles, qualities, and price ranges, the company and its product is poised for growth.   I, Lambert O Egbuchulam, am the founder and 100% owner of Bell Boardz, and anything else proprietary to it.  The company will currently operate from a home office.","Commerce and Shopping, Community and Lifestyle, Design, Sports",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The primary challenge for Small Businesses, particularly for Very Small Businesses (VSB) is acquiring leads.  With over 60% of US adults on facebook, social networks have great promise in spreading the word about their business and acquiring low-cost leads through viral reach.   Existing social marketing solutions tend to be targeted towards marketers, or those who are already familiar with the mechanics and best practices in social media and marketing.  They tend to revolve solely around sharing and social engagement metrics rather than focus on the end goal, acquiring leads. SpokeSignal is the social marketing solution for business owners, not social marketers.  It's a complete solution that works across social media outlets such as Twitter, FourSquare, Yelp, Google Plus to synthesize activity and provide meaningful guidance on engagement and marketing.  A recommendation engine based on best-practices for each industry (restaurants, retail, consulting etc) helps make the guidance highly relevant and effective.  A unified contact database allows business to track real people regardless of their point of engagement - whether they're fans on facebook, reviewers on Yelp or those who check in on FourSquare.

Sing-alongs (present since the beginning of singing) fundamentally changed with the introduction of new technology. In the late 1960s and into the 1970s, stored audible materials began to dominate the music recording industry and revolutionized the portability and ease of use of band and instrumental music by musicians and entertainers as the demand for entertainers increased globally. This may have been attributable to the introduction of music technology that arose from the need to customize music recordings and the desire for a ""handy"" format that would allow fast and convenient duplication of music and thereby meet the requirements of the entertainers' lifestyles and the 'footloose' character of the entertainment industry.",Privacy and Security,,,251-500,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
