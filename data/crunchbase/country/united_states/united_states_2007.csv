The company’s offerings have expanded to posters and downloadable presentation decks. All can be purchased directly through the company website: icd10illustrated.com. History: The concept started as a simple idea among friends. In October of 2013, Niko Skievaski decided to test the viability of this idea by creating a concept website to collect pre-sales. Over the next weeks, thousands of units were pre-ordered and art was commissioned. The first book was delivered on December 15th and shipped out in time for Christmas. The company is on track to hit $200K in revenue during 2014.  Customers: Our international customer base represents most parts of the healthcare industry including provider systems, clinicians, health IT, hospital administration and leadership, and insurers. All customers rated this product appropriately ridiculous to maximize laughter and commiseration with co-workers, clients, and friends.  Brand Assets: The ICD-10 Illustrated brand has become well known in the ICD-10 space. Since November, the company's website has seen more than 30,000 visits with a greater than 3% conversion to sale rate. Google ranks the company website in the top 2-3 pages of search results for ""ICD-10"".  ICD-10 Illustrated also owns many URLs and blogs: icd10illustrated.com, icd-10illustrated.com, icd10art.com, struckbyorca.com. These affiliates drive traffic into the company's direct sales channel. Art Assets: ICD-10 Illustrated owns the rights to distribute the art in its products. The company contracted with artists to commission works and has fulfilled all payment obligations to artists.
