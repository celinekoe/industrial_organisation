These labs were not covered on his high deductible health plan purchased on the Connecticut exchange. Being a poor student with not much in the way of savings, Adi spent two weeks calling every lab, primary care office, and urgent care center within a 20-mile radius of his home to find the best price. To his disbelief, the cost of these tests varied by as much as a $100! Having spent his previous year studying the cost of cancer treatments he knew that most of the labs were all being processed in the same few regional facilities, and all the tests cost the same to conduct. At that moment, Adi realized the extent to which the health care system was inaccessible and disenfranchising to patients. If he, a medical student and knowledgeable patient, had to spend days of research to find a vaguely affordable blood test, how much much more difficult must it be for others who are in emergent situations or do not have the privilege of such knowledge? How could anyone expect to find care that is accessible or affordable when they need it? He realized that they needed to create a better system.
