Many of our customers have been with us for over ten years, and we have helped them grow from startups to IPO/M&A.    Partner in your success Being a partner is not the same as being a supplier. Many of our clients have leaned on us to offer best practices, consult on their strategy as subject matter experts, to work with them on implementation, planning, and rollout. To train them, to help their development teams craft successful products, and to enable their product teams to price and package these products to win.   The Zentitle platform hosts millions of end users and saves our customers time and money when they want to go to market fast. Why choose us: Deep expertise: We’re your knowledgeable guide for licensing and monetization strategy  Strong technology: Best-in-class solution; industry-leading cloud-first solution to control your SaaS, on-premise, and hardware/IoT solutions; outstanding scalability, reliability, and availability  Responsive, world-class support: Developer-focused support and ongoing post-sales support   Innovative Technology Specialist Nalpeiron came first. We pioneered cloud-based software licensing in 2005, and for all that time, we have delivered Software licensing and entitlement management, pricing, and monetization tools and services. We constantly improve and build on our platform to offer customers the latest tools to help monetize their SaaS, IoT, and Enterprise Software products.   Unlike our competitors, we have two issued US patents on our technology.   Trust 1000s customers have trusted us since 2005 to help them monetize $100,000,000s. They didn’t pick just anyone to trust with that task. They picked a player with a track record of proven technology and quality of service. After 15+ years, we are here because we delivered when our customers needed it most, and they continue to support us.   Reliability For over 15 years, Nalpeiron has maintained an SLA of over 99.9% - a proven track record of reliability. Most of our competitors haven’t been around that long, let alone offer uptime guarantees or service quality.   Support near you Nalpeiron has staff in the US, the UK, and mainland Europe. We are a US-based company, and our IP is located here, as is our management team. Unlike our competitors, who are often based elsewhere with only a US virtual address, we have real support staff in the US and Europe ready to help your team when needed. And it will.   Enterprise-class service The needs of the enterprise are very different from those of a small business. Managing a complex set of requirements with many stakeholders requires a partner that has domain expertise and can share that with your team. Once launched, your partner needs to pick up the phone when you need it and to be there through good and bad. Waiting for days for help or for a bug fix is not acceptable. There are often key customers and large amounts of revenue $ on the line – you want real people ready to ensure your products succeed in the long term.   Affordable Despite offering an enterprise-class platform, we make our service affordable for startups. Pricing starts at a low monthly fee and grows as you succeed. Even startups need a reliable partner. How do you grow if the poor service of your licensing infrastructure partner damages your product? You rely on us to support your products in the field; if we are down, so are you!  Startups or large enterprises, we all need to offer the best service to our customers, or they will go elsewhere.","Information Technology, Privacy and Security, Software",1,Jon Gillespie-Brown,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Infogix, Originally founded as Unitech Systems, Inc. in 1982 by Company Leader Madhavan K. Nayar, the company grew into a leading software company with an impressive list of Fortune 100 and Global 2000 customers including Wells Fargo, Target, Progressive, and Verizon.In its early days, the company focused on the burgeoning need for independent, automated, and continuous controls software. As the volume of data processed by companies skyrocketed, the need for independent controls became even more critical. Meeting these needs, Unitech quickly expanded its footprint in multiple industries by perfecting its cutting-edge controls software. In 2005, Unitech Systems was renamed Infogix – the name being derived from the concept of the focal point where information, logic, and exchange meet. The tagline “Information With Confidence” was adopted based on the unique value customers were realizing by implementing Infogix solutions, thus gaining confidence in their information. In early 2012, based on feedback from leading customers, Infogix introduced its new “Business Operations Management” solution. For 30 years the company had successfully focused efforts on the IT and Finance areas within organizations. However, customers were coming to Infogix and sharing success stories of implementing multiple Infogix solutions to achieve Operational Transformation. It was not just the IT and Finance areas that were seeing incredible value, the entire company operations were experiencing improvement through the use of Infogix solutions. And with this, the Infogix “Business Operations Management” solution was born. On June 1, 2012 Infogix announced that H.I.G. Capital, a leading global private equity investment firm with more than $9.0 billion of equity capital under management, has recapitalized the business. Sumit Nijhawan, Chief Executive Officer of Infogix said, “While we expect that customers will experience a seamless transition in this new partnership, in the long-term, they will also enjoy enhanced product and service offerings.”","Data and Analytics, Internet Services, Software",1,Madhaven K.

Even before construction was complete on St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, ALSAC began funding research to cure childhood cancer and other life-threatening diseases. In 1958, ALSAC presented its first major grant to pathologist Lemuel Diggs, MD to continue his work, resulting in the world’s first comprehensive study of sickle cell disease. ALSAC and St Jude are dedicated to ensuring that no child is denied care because of ethnicity, religion, or financial status. Since its inception, ALSAC has raised 80% of the funding needed to operate and support the hospital's lifesaving mission. Largely enabled by the fundraising efforts of ALSAC, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital has become one of the largest pediatric oncology centers in the world, treating over 8,500 children each year.

After being involved in the sports nutrition world for years and seeing shortcomings in the industry, they had the idea to construct a high-quality lifestyle line to fill the void left by today’s big manufacturers. Working with some of the best names in the industry to formulate their products, they created an entirely different nutrition delivery method that proved to be more efficient than anything that was currently in the market. Utilizing this new approach they developed their first product: Foundation. Why did the brothers decide to develop a cellular energy product as their first product instead of the generic protein powders or a pre-workout that all the other manufacturers sell? The answer is simple. Much like constructing a house, your body requires a solid base on which to build. Without strong groundwork, nothing tough can be built. Foundation became the most effective product on the market for creating the base needed for serious growth, and that was just the beginning for BrickHouse Nutrition. Now headquartered in Texas, BrickHouse strives to stay on the cutting edge of nutraceutical innovation. Our team works relentlessly to formulate the best science and research based products on the market today. Aimed at improving your health, performance, and overall life, BrickHouse helps build a better you, One Brick at a Time!",Commerce and Shopping,2,"Eric Serrano, Myles Grimard",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
