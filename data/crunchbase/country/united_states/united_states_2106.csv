Diginome was formed to solve risk data problems in massive “big data” enterprise environments.  The integrity of a business is only as high as the integrity of the information that supports it. Diginome gives organizations a revolutionary way to maintain high information integrity and thereby reduce corporate risk. Our patented DataDNA™ technology delivers unprecedented information transparency along with game-changing capabilities for ensuring granular integrity of digital information, continuously and completely. With DataDNA, organizations can quickly “connect the dots” to identify flawed processes and prevent digital disasters.  A $100 billion market is rapidly developing around Risk Information Technologies and Services (RITS), particularly in financial Services. In May 2014, IDC upgraded its forecast for this market: “the worldwide risk information technologies and services (RITS) market will grow to $79.2 billion in 2015 and $97.3 billion by 2018. As a percentage of total IT spending, which is forecast to crest $530 billion by 2018, the RITS market in financial services will account for an average of 17.1% of overall IT spending in 2015 and growing to 18.2% of total spending by 2018, as risk management technologies, services, and solutions continue to participate in a growing market that is core to business strategies across the banking, capital markets, and insurance sectors.”  One of the major drivers in the growth of the RITS market is a requirement that financial institutions comply with a set of fourteen principles for Risk Data Aggregation (RDA) and Reporting as mandated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Diginome is well positioned to address the RDA requirements. Industry analysts and database pundits envisage that, in the current decade, enterprises will move to a 3rd generation architectural model emphasizing the protection of data and the use of automated systems to predict and pre-empt risk. There is an expanding need for platforms that will enable the enterprise to pre-empt financial risk, execute real-time audits and forensic evaluations, as well as stop loss and exposure from M&A activities, fraud, AML, and other potential sources of compromised data. There are no obvious dominant players in this space, which is Diginome’s core strength.  Diginome is focused on using 3rd generation architecture and technology to address opportunities within this $100B Financial Services RITS Market.  The DataDNA™ data integrity platform is a unique, patented software technology for monitoring and managing information integrity across the span of enterprise platforms and applications. DataDNA is a holistic solution that disrupts the existing integrity paradigm and builds a new expectation of trust in enterprise data. Partners, industry analysts and clients have validated DataDNA as a superior scalable solution for automated, granular, holistic data provenance and integrity.","Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Software",2,"Kamyar Shadan, Paul Bertucci",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
