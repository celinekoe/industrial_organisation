Inside you`ll discover a BRAND NEW WAY to play all of your favorite variations of solitaire that are so addictive and more fun to play, you may never go back to or play traditional solitaire ever again! Our new, revolutionary and proprietary Full Color® Cards system that the games use create ""13, 16, 19, 22 & 25 card sets"" that enables hundreds of new levels and degrees of difficulty to open up an entirely new world of game play that wasn`t even possible until now, all of which is sure to entertain you for years on end. Version 1.0 starts with 100 levels in the FreeCell, Golf, Klondike, Pyramid, Spider 1, 2 & 4 Suit variations in an all-in-one universal app for iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch with hundreds more to be released on a continual basis. Anyone, anywhere, in any language from age 3 to 103 can learn to play the games in about 15 seconds or less if they are already familiar with the old rules and methods. Here`s how it works: Full Color® Solitaire has simplified the sorting systems that classic games of solitaire are based on by eliminating the usage of face cards and the redundant duplication of red and black class systems by removing all of the completely unnecessary and totally confusing visual artwork off of the cards. This takes the 3 part card system of ""rank, suit and class"" in a traditional deck of cards and replaces it with a simplified 2 part card system of ""rank and suit"" by using nothing more than different colors and numbers. By removing the face cards that stop with the King, which is really a 13, we are able to create an unlimited set of variations of every game of solitaire by making the highest ranking card (the controlling factor) in any game, any number we want. Our first release expands the highest ranking card to 25, in increments of 3`s, to create the 13, 16, 19, 22 and 25 card sets. So if you thought the games you play now challenge you with 13 cards in a ranked suit, wait until you try the higher levels we make now! But that`s only half of the reinvention! Since the key to winning almost all solitaire games is to reach the top of a tableau as fast as possible, we also added a 5th suit that consists of ""the white card"" which is in essence, a ""free card"" that has absolutely no sorting restrictions whatsoever, so when you get to one, you can remove it from the game field into it`s Any White Card™ foundation and resolve the games faster. We`ve made the games much more simple to play yet strategically more complex all at the same time and unlike the old solitaire, it appears, after millions of our own game plays, every game of FreeCell, Klondike and Spider 1, 2 & 4 suit is completely solvable if you play them right! Our universal app is optimized for the high definition retina display modes and features a rich user experience with wide screen horizontal gameplay mode; a dynamic and smooth-as-silk multi-touch scrolling tabletop, 24 different user definable card sizes; stats bars; video ""tips, tricks and strategy"" tutorials; customizable touch preferences; statistics tracking; leaderboards and so much more. All games are free to play in an ad supported network with an internet connection or you can purchase game levels by single games or discounted in bundles, entire card sets or monthly subscriptions in an ad and banner free environment playable anywhere at anytime with or without a data connection. Competition features for speed and ease of play include custom swiping gestures, touch/tap preferences plus custom backgrounds are all available as In App Purchases.","Apps, Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Financial Services, Gaming, Mobile, Payments, Software, Travel and Tourism",1,David W.

Its organizational leadership which includes partners Jessica M. Dean, Amin M. Omar, Trey Branham, Lisa Shirley, Benjamin H. Adams and Ben Braly all believe that corporations should be held accountable – particularly when it comes to safety. The hardworking men and women of this country need stable jobs to provide for their families and to continue to live the way they’ve always wanted. But they shouldn’t fall victim to corporate negligence that could potentially cause them harm. A safe workplace isn’t a privilege – it’s a right. More than anything else, the team at Dean Omar Branham Shirley believes that nobody should have to worry about developing some type of life-threatening disease or getting seriously injured just because a major company put its own bottom line ahead of the safety of its workforce. Dean Omar Branham Shirley was founded to bring a much-needed level of accountability to a wide range of different industries. The law sets forth  what is expected of corporations and  makes sure that there are significant consequences for those who are found in willful violation of the rules.  When the firm litigates to enforce these rules that have historically been ignored, they're both fighting for the rights of victims and working to force better corporate decision-making moving forward - which in and of itself may be the most important benefit of all. When they're not in trial, the team at Dean Omar Branham Shirley also works hard to give back to the communities they live and work in. They partner with friends, community members and more to help make our cities safer - even for people that they may never end up meeting. All of this harkens back to the reason the firm was founded to begin with, and it's an ideal they will never stop working hard to live up to.",Professional Services,2,"Jessica Dean, Trey Branham",51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Ascendant's mission is to work with talented CEOs that are socially conscious and innovative to grow their company by getting them directly in front of the customers, influencers, and potential stakeholders that matter the most to their business.  The company's premise is simple:  Put a talented CEO in front of their target audience consistently and their business will grow faster.  Business for companies under the Fortune 1000 level is still built principally with emotional connection.   With an ongoing cultural focus on celebrity, selfies, and the enormous amount of clutter online, having a brand that resonates with people has never been more important.  Research from one of the top PR firms in the world, Burston-Marsteller, drives this point home: Based on the CEO’s reputation: •	95% of those surveyed decided whether or not to invest in a company. •	93% would recommend a company as a good alliance or merger partner. •	88% recommend the company as a good place to work. Over the past 5 years, AG has serviced the following clientele and achieved significant results: •	Primarily CEOs at companies between 5 million to 100 million in revenue. •	Talented entrepreneurs seeking to build multimillion dollar companies.

The Seeker SPR technology was first developed by ERA Technology of Leatherhead, Surrey, England, in the 1980s to locate plastic landmines as part of a British Ministry of Defense contract. It helped reduce the risk of locating these dangerous, time-delayed bombs through rubble and in the ground. After performing admirably, commercial versions of the technology were developed in 1990, incorporating improvements that made it more user-friendly to the private sector and accessible to the masses. US Radar was formed in 1994 as the ERA Technology sales and marketing partner for the Americas. It's original mission was to promote the Seeker SPR technology, determine and test new applications, and identify product improvements. In 2002, ERA Technology was acquired by an organization that sold the Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) division.
