INFXL Cloud is targeted at those who want to use deep nets, but do not have the requisite knowledge and experience. A typical user will be an automation engineer, who knows how to collect and shape data and is interested in using deep nets as a controller. All you need to do is to normalize and scale the raw data and upload it in the form of features and labels files. Just two files; no questions asked about the deep net architecture or training parameters! In a day's time, you will receive a page of simple, highly-efficient C code that does not even read like a deep net.

In addition to its physical location in Little Rock, AR, the company also offers Build-proud.com, an online catalog that services those in the custom cabinet industry. This platform gives our customers “ a one-stop shopping “  for all of our customers. AWP's distribution areas cover several states, including Oklahoma, Mississippi, Tennessee, Missouri, Alabama, and Texas. Because of the desire to provide the best in the industry to customers, AWP works with industry-leading providers of lumber and plywood and buys an annual volume of Hardwood lumber board footage of around 9 million board feet. Regular purchases include hard and soft maple, poplar, FAS red oak, and 4/4 Northern and Appalachian KD material. On average, the company also purchases annually around 50 containers of exotic lumber, between 50 to 75 truckloads of MDF, and nearly 500 truckloads of hardwood plywood. It is also common for AWP to secure nearly 45 truckloads of Poplar and Red Oak gang ripped blanks each year. In 2014, Victor Barringer purchased and rebranded the company that is now doing business as AWP. The letters stand for Acadian Wood Products. Build- Proud.com, a sister company, and supplier of all things related to custom cabinetry, was launched in 2019 and also has its home office in the Little Rock area. The Build-Proud.com goal is straightforward: exactly what you need, at a price you can afford, in our direct markets and nationwide. The commitment to quality is found in the mission state of AWP. The goal is to work with both vendors and consumers to deliver unparalleled service, products, and solutions within the specialty hardwoods market. Given the wide range of woods offered, AWP fuels the construction of flooring, furniture, cabinetry, and more across the nation. Through BuildProud, buyers can expect top-quality merchandise and old-school services as the team sources the products requested at the best prices. This promise of quality and service equates to both considerable savings and hassle-free transactions, and customer reviews indicate a positive working relationship exists with each account. Says Victor Barring, “ I am the Chief Quality Control Officer, relationships mean something to AWP, our top accounts have my direct line and can call me anytime its if not right. “  With the need to successfully interact within a global economy and to support sustainable and ethical business practices, it is important to join a professional organization where peers and industry experts become valuable resources and contacts. For AWP, there are four well-recognized associations where the company maintains active memberships. These are: Indiana Hardwood Lumbermen’s Association National Hardwood Lumber Association Hardwood Distributors Association Cabinet Makers Association. Between the product offerings of BuildProud and the AWP operations, consumers find more options with hardwood and specialty woodworking. The diverse inventory accommodates needs for both standard and rare items, but the in-house millwright and molding program allows skilled craftsmen to have more control over the products and customizations requested. This is a significant advantage over the competition in the industry, as the work does not get outsourced to a third party and results in cost savings passed along to the consumer. It’s a big reason that over the last two years, sales were up 62%, and the company added more than 300 new accounts.",,,,101-250,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
