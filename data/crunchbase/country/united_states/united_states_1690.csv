The web based application allows a business to make a coupon in minutes and then distribute it via email, print or on social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.  Unlike Groupon and the other daily deal sites, which keep up to 50% of the revenue of any ""deal"" offered by a merchant,  CashOff.com offers its coupon management system for as little as $10 per month without any revenue sharing whatsoever.   A recent report from Juniper Research suggests that the mobile coupon market will be worth $46 billion by 2015, a large jump from the $5.6 billion projected for the industry this year. In this day and age, consumers expect there to be deals when they go shopping, but most small businesses cannot afford the revenue sharing percentages the daily deal sites require and so they end up losing consumers to other companies that buy into the game.  Because of its low cost and marketing effectiveness, CashOff appeals to every business and has already started to go viral.  CashOff is currently offering a Free 12 Month Trial to its first 1,000 users.   The Company had a soft launch without formal announcement several days ago and the user sign ups have already far exceeded the Company's expectations.   “Within five days of going live, not only have small businesses across the country started to use our System, but we also signed up a restaurant that is part of a billion dollar national food chain,” according to Brian  Thomas, Founder, Chief Noise Maker and CEO. “30 years ago, I grew up in a family with so little money that if it were not for coupons I wouldn't be alive!   We think CashOff represents a game changer in the five billion dollar coupon space and we are excited to provide an affordable service that supports local economies.  My Mother Would be Proud of Me”.  About CashOff Inc.  CashOff is a cloud-based Coupon Management System that enables merchants to create and manage professional looking digital or mobile coupons with ease.  The CashOffs are the digital equivalent of traditional coupons but specifically designed to be used in emails, on websites and on social networks including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and others.
