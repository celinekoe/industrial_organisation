APGR Green was extended to extinguish fiery ant mounds when a native Texan joined the venture. It was his belief that APGR Green’s concept would also be effective in controlling these populations. Testing in Texas and Louisiana proved his theory. Out of extensive research and testing, Mole-Zap and Ant-Zap were born. Using food grade CO2 (used in sodas, sparkling water, fountain drinks, etc.), it was discovered that by displacing oxygen in mole burrows and ant mounds, the animal would simply go to sleep and never wake up. Finally, providing an environmentally safe solution to get rid of these pests that actually works.

Learning happens best when there is robust dialogue among diverse groups with differing backgrounds and opinions. Rather than being another outlet focused on ‘Breaking News,’ dramatization, and sensationalism, Curiosity Shots intends on bridging cultural divides by fostering communication. Our writers include the likes of students, members of the working public, elite journalists, celebrities, and artists. We are fostering a community that includes people from all walks of life in order to inform and mend wounds. Until all voices are heard, not just media, financial, and political elites, only division will persist. This is why our team leaves out no group and involves all people in the conversation under one roof.   Educational Content Created To Inspire   In an age defined by our ability to interact with the entire known cosmos with a mere touch of a tablet, all citizens have become perpetual students. It is for this reason that Curiosity Shots believes the time has arrived to introduce a reinvigorated model of education. One that not only meets the demands of our time, but pioneers advancements in integrating technology into the learning process. The assembly line model of education that persists to this day was designed to produce factory workers for an export-oriented economy. This is why students are force-fed information via a one-size-fits-all approach without consideration for individual differences and what it means to truly learn.
