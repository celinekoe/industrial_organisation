For centuries, people have given books to each other. Books are the perfect gift; meaningful and personal, a book reflects the thought that the gift-giver put into the purchase. We created Livrada title-based e-book gift cards (US Patent pending) to recapture this experience. We want to reintroduce a personal touch into the world of digital media, starting with e-books. What is a Livrada e-book card? A Livrada e-book card is a (physical) gift card, sold at retail, that represents a specific e-book title (e.g., The Adventures of Tom Sawyer ). Each card is beautifully designed with the book cover art and also includes a description, much like a traditional book jacket. The card allows the holder to redeem and download the specific e-book onto their e-reader device. At launch, this includes all Kindle and NOOK devices. The plan is to expand to other e-readers soon. The Company Livrada, Inc., based in Southern California, was formed in January 2012 by an experienced team of entrepreneurs with deep business and technology backgrounds. Our team consists of experienced executives from the digital media, wireless, pre-paid, payments, and e-commerce industries. We’ve spent time at world-class companies like Virgin Mobile USA, Warner Music Group, McKinsey & Co., Deloitte, and Lexis-Nexis, as well as a number of scrappy start-ups. We are lovers of technology who happen to believe that the off-line “real world” offers experiences that cannot be replicated in digital.

Various infrastructures already exist to electronically send medical records between disparate healthcare providers such as the widespread use of the DIRECT protocol.  But, because of the thousands of different existing data formats and complex semantics, a medical record sent by one provider cannot be understood or consumed by the receiving provider's system. The SemantX SaaS service provides a complete, affordable solution to the problem of Health information interoperability.   With a simple software download, Healthcare Providers can be up and exchanging medical records in hours, not days or weeks.  Their self-contained solution does not require any sophisticated IT resources. It's priced at a low-cost subscription and it is designed to significantly reduce maintenance costs.  What this means -- even the smallest Healthcare Provider can now afford electronic healthcare interoperability. The solution is based on MDMI, a published message interoperability standard that is supported by healthcare standards bodies. As soon as a Provider joins the service, the Provider will be able to send validated messages to Federal and State agencies in the required complex message standards.  But they will not need to know those standards or keep track of any changes in those standards.",Health Care,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Problem: There is no user friendly, free, public facing platform that aggregates videos by location from social media. (e.g. YouTube, Twitter, Periscope). Centric App allows users to organically discover videos of what’s happening around them and see what’s going on outside the “echo chamber” - of their own networks. At the same time creators need a way to connect organically and share video content with audiences that does not involve infiltrating their social networks or gaming social platforms algorithms. The result is a dis-connect, with users missing out on what’s happening around them and creators producing huge amounts of content that is not reaching new viewers, growing audiences or monetizing. In reality it is gathering dust. Solution: Centric App allows anyone to quickly discover videos being published around them, whatever the channel or platform. They can find out what’s happening locally, discover new content, share and comment. They can follow, engage and connect with creators and publishers on the source platform. Bottom line is Centric matches video content by location, just like Tinder, bringing audiences and videos together. Centric shares undiscovered content with a new audience and grows reach for content producers. ￼","Apps, Content and Publishing, Data and Analytics, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Navigation and Mapping, Software, Video",1,Vincent Gibson,1-10,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Starting in January 2008, the success of Retina-X Studios' software led to the creation of a boxed retail product, now carried by numerous chains in thousands of stores nationally. This provides access to this application genre to a new audience. Positive reviews, media coverage, and continued success has helped RXS grow at a phenomenal rate, with sales growth of over 1600% in a two year span. Purchased by more than 100,000 customers in over 150 countries, Retina-X Studios software is widely acknowledged as leading the field in this market niche.

With more than 30 years combined experience, our team of tax and accounting professionals can save your company time, money and countless headaches with our extensive small business quickbooks and accounting services.    We have grown our business from nothing but a Linkedin Profile to a company generating almost $400,000 a year in revenue in just under 3 years. Completely Organically.    I started this business in my spare room as a single mother who didn't know what was coming next when her husband left his family. I put my resume on Linkedin and from there I have allowed this business to bring my family the peace and stability it needed during such a crises. Now we employ 1 full time accountant and another bookkeeper. We literally turn away business because of the costs to set up more computer systems, hire on staff and the cost of training them. We pass on at least $10k-$15k a month of additional revenue on an average without advertising. I have already just hired another person in January with the expectation to grown and we increased revenue by 27% from them and they are only at 40% capacity as we are still training them.  With the requested funding of $75,000 for Advertising, the additional computer equipment, education & training on the platforms we use, I can project growth of over $ 300,000 in the last half of 2015. Next Year, I suspect it will be a no less than 750K year very conservatively if not 1 million easily.  We are also different from any other accounting practice as 90% of our income is subscription auto payments by ach / credit card, We do not carry account receivable and our ave client pays around $800 per month fixed auto debit from their credit card or checking account for 1","Financial Services, Other, Professional Services",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
