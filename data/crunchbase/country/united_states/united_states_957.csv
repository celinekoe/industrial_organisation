Additionally, Al Otaiba has assisted with the UAE establishing partnerships with prominent U.S. organizations. These partnerships have included renowned academic and medical institutions, such as New York University and the Cleveland Clinic.  Continuously working to build and fortify the partnership between Emiratis and Americans, the UAE Embassy created UAE USA United — a unique campaign that showcases accomplishments won through collaborations between changemakers from both countries. Supporting the goal of creating a better future together, UAE USA United highlights innovation being accomplished across STEM fields, security, climate action and the arts by both countries. United in its forward vision, Emiratis and Americans have also fostered deep friendships. UAE USA United celebrates the more than five decades of intercultural connections through its “50 Years | 50 Faces” — a storytelling series which features narratives from UAE and American residents alike.   Additionally, the UAE Embassy has shown its support for uplifting U.S. communities through its Community Soccer Program, which constructs soccer fields for youths in underserved communities. To date, the program has built 12 all-weather soccer fields across the United States. A soccer fanatic himself, Ambassador Al Otaiba has personally worked to support this embassy initiative, assisting in the launch of several fields. The UAE has set a future-oriented vision by prioritizing inclusion, peace and respect. Exemplifying these values of tolerance through its work in the U.S., the embassy has made specific efforts toward emphasizing religious tolerance, empowering Emirati women and encouraging innovation in the MENA region. The embassy has gone on to host annual interfaith Iftars, art exhibitions, cultural events, celebrations of innovations and other gatherings surrounding the UAE’s values.",,,,101-250,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
