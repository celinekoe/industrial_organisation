Slimbox,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/slimbox,"Email, Productivity Tools, Software","Cleveland, Ohio, United States",Slimbox is a tool that provides unsubscribing services.,"3,031,825","Great Lakes, Midwestern US",,Active,2013-03-04,day,,,,,For Profit,https://slimboxapp.com,"Slimbox moves subscription and notification emails out of your inbox and summarizes them in one daily email. You can check those messages anytime through a folder that is created in your Gmail or by going to slimboxapp.com. You control which senders stay in your inbox and which ones are sent to Slimbox so you don’t miss anything important. How Slimbox is Different: Slimbox is activated in one click:  Slimbox scans your Gmail for promotional and subscription emails in about 5 seconds. With one click, Slimbox instantly creates filters that move incoming email from as many of these senders as you wish out of your inbox. A daily summary means you never miss an email: Slimbox moves email out of your inbox into a folder that you can access at any time. But because Slimbox sends you a daily summary of the email that has been moved out of your way, you’ll never miss a thing. Slimbox means never having to unsubscribe again: Most of the overload in our inboxes is not things we don’t want ever — it’s things that we don’t want right now. By getting those emails out of your way, Slimbox makes unsubscribing a thing of the past. Slimbox works everywhere you check your email: Because Slimbox uses native Gmail filters there is nothing extra to download or install. This means you can experience a decluttered inbox on any device or app that has Gmail. Slimbox is not in the data business: Slimbox cannot read your emails and does not sell your data. Instead of monetizing user data, Slimbox charges $1 per month. Slimbox has also been verified by Google for data security and user privacy.","Information Technology, Internet Services, Messaging and Telecommunications, Software",4,"David Mills, Dhruva Ganesan, Michael Mills, Peter Schultheiss",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
