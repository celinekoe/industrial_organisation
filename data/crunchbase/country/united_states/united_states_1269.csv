We leverage advanced user interface design running on next generation wearable and mobile technology, augmented reality, voice interaction, speech-to-text, and clinical language understanding to provide an effortless and intuitive user experience. Healium creates technology that makes technology disappear, enabling the healing that happens when doctor and patient connect deeply and directly with one another. Clinicians' time is valuable–and much of that time is consumed in EMR tasks. In fact, a recent study showed that physicians spend 44% of their time attending to the EMR, and click 400 times per hour during the average workday. That's time they're not spending with their patients. Healium's human-friendly technologies reclaim some of the time clinicians spend at the computer, improve work satisfaction, increase direct patient interaction, and support quality care delivery. Those advantages come with real-dollar ROI, since the cost of clinicians' time is often the biggest line item in a healthcare organization's budget.","Hardware, Health Care, Software",2,"Carl Spitzer, Craig Rosenberg",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The patent info for my idea can be viewed by clicking on ""patent info"" under external links on the right hand side bottom of this profile. The basic idea for the company is to create alternative fuel through one of six methods and two different fuels (fusion and fission). The most original inventive step  is the pre-cutting/drilling method which can be read about in paragraph 27 of the body of the patent. Any use of this method of digging, for example to build the type of power plant described in the drawings, would be prohibited without their permission, and they could therefore collect royalties from its use to create other systems and the profits those systems create. You may recall that cratering for energy was attempted in the 1950's in the sedan experiments and abandoned because of disappointing results. Two methods were attempted, one was underground the other surface. The efficiency's were .1% and .4% respectively. The earthquake caused by underground blasts and the ugly amount of radioactive material thrown into the air by surface blasts, ended these experiments as viable sources of energy. The method of pre cutting is entirely new and the primary selling point of this whole patent. I HAVE done the experiments and I DO KNOW THAT IT WORKS. Underground blasts caused earthquakes because the expanding ""balloon"" of energy if you will, had no place to escape and spread out like a wave through surrounding rock. My experiments with pre-cutting PROVES, without a doubt, that the expanding bubble of explosive energy will push that pre-cut piece of material out, with very little energy being transferred into seismic, most into weight displacement,and some into heat, and some into sound.","Energy, Natural Resources, Sustainability",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Trinity has assembled a team of seasoned experts with industry expertise and core-competencies to manage the investment life-cycle from project acquisition through development, drilling, production and exit strategy for investor liquidity of each project and investment.                                                                                                                      (The Kelly Lease) The Kelly lease is approximately 40 acres in size and is located in Bakersfield Ca.  The interest to be acquired is 70% Working Interest (WI) and 56% Net Revenue Interest (NRI) and the lease contains approximately 6.7 million gross barrels of oil (mbo) in place (which equates to approximately 4.0 million barrels of oil recoverable) in five different producing zones of the China Grade formation which can be produced by a steam flood operation. Some 15 wells were drilled in the 1940’s and ‘50’s and were produced for a time. However, when oil prices plunged in the mid to late 1990’s, the operation became uneconomic and the operator of that time simply abandoned the field. The California Department of Oil and Gas assumed operations and performed abandonment procedures on the existing wells in 2002, which left most of the downhole piping in place. We believe that we can utilize these wells to serve as production wells but new steam injection wells will need to be drilled and equipped.","Energy, Natural Resources, Sustainability",,,1-10,1,,200000,USD,200000,200000,USD,200000,,,,,Private,,,,,,
