L. Gaddis, Sr., George C. McLaurin, B. W. Griffith, Marye Dabney, R. L. Crook, W. W. Downing, C. S. Spann, Sr., S. S. Carter, H. S. Perkins and P. D. Ratliff as the original incorporators. All of these were local business people with an interest in seeing that the community of Raymond should be served with a locally owned and operated bank. The sizable sum of $25,000 was placed in the bank at that time as capital. Mr. J. L. Gaddis, Sr. served as the first president of the bank and was succeeded in 1936 by his son, J. L. Gaddis, Jr. The descendants of Mr. Gaddis, Sr. remain as principal shareholders of the bank today. The bank originally opened in the building adjacent to the Hinds County Court House in Raymond on Main Street. Included in the bank was a large safe that was manufactured in 1903 by the Mosler Safe Company of Hamilton, Ohio. The safe was placed on a concrete slab and the wooden-floored building constructed around it. It was not until 1981 that the safe was moved from the original bank building and placed on display in the existing bank building in the same city block. The safe required considerable restoration work after having survived a fire and years of neglect. The main office of the bank today is located in a building constructed for that purpose in 1923. The Merchants and Planters Bank was one of only a few area banks that did not close during the Great Depression. The panic of the so-called ""Bank Holiday"" of 1932 soon passed due to the fortitude and stability of the Raymond people. Although the local economy suffered, the bank survived those days by committing itself to the needs of its customers. That lesson was well learned and serves as the basis for the bank's success today. The bank remains as one of the very few small, independent community banks in Hinds County. Although the list of services provided to its customers has grown considerably from the early years, the commitment to extending only the best in basic, personal banking to a local market is unshakable. The legacy of genuine concern for people as outlined by former presidents T. H. Kendall, Jr. and H. R. Kilby, Sr. remains in the minds of many bank customers today. Today, the bank maintains four offices in central Hinds County. In an attempt to better meet the needs of its mobile customers, the bank in 1979 opened its first branch office just east of Raymond. The office featured two lanes of drive-in services along with easy access to Highway 18 and Main Street. In 1987, the bank acquired the stock of the Merchants Bank of Bolton, Mississippi and developed that office into the bank's third location. The Merchants Bank of Bolton had also maintained a long and successful history of serving a local market. The banking philosophies of both banks were similar and resulted in a merger of two common interests in customer satisfaction. In late 1992, the bank established its fourth office in nearby Clinton, Mississippi in a temporary location. In August of 1995, a new and permanent facility with all the up to date banking conveniences was dedicated in place of the temporary quarters. With strong capital and a desire to extend services to a fast-growing commercial and residential market, the bank continues its commitment to serving all of that market with the best in small bank products. The board of directors, officers and employees of the Merchants and Planters Bank extend to you an invitation to join us in the healthy banking relationships that we have strived to maintain since 1906.","Financial Services, Lending and Investments",,,51-100,1,,,,,3718258,USD,3718258,Community Development Financial Institutions Fund,1,1,,Private,,,,,,

Most of the investment in the digital divide is focused on bandwidth, yet most of the storage and computing power is controlled by 3 main companies and centralized infrastructure is very expensive. Also, most of the smartphones in developing countries are low-end smartphones with low internal memory and low processing power that accentuate the digital divide. Finally, lack of energy access is a huge problem, if you do not have electricity at home you cannot charge your phone and use it the way you want, also building storage and computing power solution require energy that is why at ARED we use renewable energy.  To solve this digital divide, ARED developed a mini-server platform to store digital applications closer to the users and minimize the cost of the internet, and we developed a solar kiosk platform to power the technology but also provide additional services such as phone charging to become a one-stop-shop platform.  We spent 6 years developing the technology, and in 2020 we started piloting our technology in 6 African countries with local partners (Rwanda, Uganda, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Burkinafaso, and Ivory Coast).

When you put on your VR headset and come to our virtual Zen dojo we make meditation as clear and structured as possible with our research backed curriculum. The fully immersive qualities of virtual reality allow us to bring our students to a separate space for meditation. No clutter still sitting in front of you on your desk or todo lists in your periphery - we remove the distractions of the outside world and engage you in a dedicated, peaceful, and realistic environment - without forcing you to leave your home or alter your schedule. VR also allows us to incorporate dynamic experiences to the classroom, such as teaching on a mountain top, or in a rainstorm, or with metaphorical tools like clouds floating by to represent thoughts. Things you could never achieve in real life! Unlike existing meditation phone apps,  we don’t just provide temporary relaxation; we teach with a focus on education, growth, and how to apply what you learn to your everyday life. Actual, practical, techniques, mindsets, and philosophies to use outside of virtual reality. We have a developed product launched on Oculus App Lab, Oculus Rift, and Steam VR marketplaces and initial traction with hundreds of paying customers in the first few months. We’re developing partnerships with key VR headset distributors and other wellness companies.
