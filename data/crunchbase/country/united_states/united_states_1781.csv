Consumer Problem - Shopping local retailers online is mostly non-existent and a poor experience at best. Solution: XION makes it insanely easy for small retailers to create an ecommerce store. Small retailers simply create a store on our marketplace website and add products from our database.  A consumer uses our site to shop their local retailers online and in one place. With our site they can see which local retailers carry the products they are looking for and can purchase them directly on our site or just go to the nearest shop and get it. Mission Statement: XION’s mission is to create the best consumer shopping experience. Why We’re Doing This: Dan Fairbanks started XION because when he was operating his own specialty running stores and e-commerce site he got really fed up with the bad software he was using. Dan couldn't find a software solution that truly made my life easier as a small retailer. He knew there had to be a better way. Dan teamed up with Robert Ivie, a veteran software engineer, and together they are building the future of omni-channel retailing. Team: Dan Fairbanks - CEO - Dan graduated from BYU with a degree in entrepreneurship in 2009. Dan started and operated his own running stores and e-commerce website for 4 years in the Seattle area. He then went to a coding bootcamp to learn iOS development, which he did professionally for 2 years before starting XION. Dan was in the first Startup Ignition cohort where he applied the lean startup methodology to validate his ideas with customers. Dan has a knack for great UI/UX design and will hustle to do whatever needs to be done to make XION a success. Robert Ivie - CTO - Robert is a veteran programmer who can get a lot done quickly. He excels solving complex problems and works really well in teams. Robert has worked for big companies and startups alike including Ancestry, ProPay, Powercode, and FamilySearch. Robert has turned down CTO offers at other companies to work on XION because he believes in XION’s mission.","Commerce and Shopping, Hardware, Internet Services, Software",2,"Dan Fairbanks, Robert Ivie",1-10,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,RevRoad,1,1,,Private,,,,,,

Using this data, we apply five proprietary AI algorithms to reveal the current & future Net Present Value, NPV, of perishable foods, and natural/clean label ingredients inventory. Users can now optimize their inventory and reduce waste. Problem - Visually humans can’t determine the condition of perishable products and for Supply Chain managers decisions must be made on huge volumes of products at high velocity.  Without our technology perishables are shipped or stored with mismatched timing, the perishables quickly lose value, become unsellable and waste is the result. FreshSurety’s proprietary technology and algorithms answer three questions 1) What is the current value of my inventory? 2)   What is the Depreciation tomorrow and the day after? 3) Are there any problem events with my inventory?  Unlike our competitors, which only guess what the inventory state is based on inferior mathematical models we measure certain targeted chemical actors to determine the actual freshness state of the product.   We are the first to provide in real-time both the current and projected NPV of perishables inventory at either the order batch level or pallet level based on real data.   Supply Chain Managers get direct feedback on the current value of their inventory, not a “guess”. In the home our products work inside of refrigerators, measuring stored foods remaining nutrition value so people can make better choices of when to best consume their foods based on its actual measured state. Also, our system alarms if Microbial Contamination is detected. Value Proposition: Making the products' Current Value and Rate of Depreciation visible, we literally take money from the trash and put it back in our customers' pockets.  Business Model: Make Freshness Sensors cheap enough to give away and sell freshness IaaS NPV analysis. Our technology allows for automated real-time sampling of high-risk perishable stocks to a customer determined Acceptable Quality Level, AQL, at a 95% quality confidence level. Without FreshSurety technology only a very low confidence level <10%, (meaningless) quality inspection plans are possible. Because these plans have limited value, they are simply not performed, rendering the condition of stocks invisible and dangerous. Our technology has been demonstrated to successfully predict perishable freshness outcomes days in advance.  Competing solutions based on time & temperature technology are only right 16% of the time. FreshSurety's algorithms correctly label bad food as bad 99.3% of the time.    Our end-to-end system reduces food waste by over 1.5 tons per million dollars of retail value for Supply Chains over 5 days long and allows for automated real-time sampling of perishable stock at a 95% quality confidence level. We have gathered the world’s largest machine learning/AI training sets of perishable foods and have made many food freshness discoveries previously unknown to science. The scientists and engineers of FreshSurety have over 120 years of combined technical and business experience working on programs for defense customers and DARPA.  We put our skills to work to create a new food freshness system that doesn’t require a degree in chemistry to use.  Working with food economists we built a new end-to-end system that reports the value of perishable foods, working in real-time, automatically, 24 X 7 X 365.","Information Technology, Software, Transportation",2,"John Hodges, Marc Rippen",1-10,4,Seed,1150000,USD,1150000,1150000,USD,1150000,"SOSV, Food-X, Florida Institute for the Commercialization of Florida Technology",1,3,,Private,,,,,,

Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis. U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.","Other, Transportation",2,"Laura G Aguirre, Leonardo Shoen",10001+,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
