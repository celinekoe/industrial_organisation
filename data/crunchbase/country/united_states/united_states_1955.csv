We specialize in many types of insurance, but business insurance is one of our top specialties. This includes (but is not limited to): small to medium size business of any industry, workers compensation, commercial insurance and many other types of insurance policies. In addition to business insurance, we specialize in the following insurance types: Personal Insurance, Commercial Property Insurance, Business Insurance, Surety Bonds, Directors and Officers liability insurance and more. If you have questions about the specifics of any of these policies, we would be more than happy to explain them to you. When searching for commercial property insurance, there are many things to consider. By obtaining several quotes on our website from different insurance companies, a person can easily find the commercial insurance policy that is the best for them. Some insurance policies offer much higher levels of coverage than others, and a person can determine the level of coverage that they need by having the buildings that they want to insure appraised by a real estate expert. Certain types of natural disasters, such as floods, hurricanes and earthquakes, can easily cause a large amount of damage to a building. Before signing up for a certain policy, a customer should thoroughly read the terms and the conditions in order to determine which types of events are fully covered.

With our patent pending system and process, emere can eliminate or reduce transaction fees for retailers and offer an improved purchase experience for consumers, removing barriers for use and enabling a tighter relationship between supplier and consumer. Our initial target is the $20+ B retail vending and mobile food market with expansion into general retail.  With emere tools, retail vendors  can drive sales and push market special offers enabling expansion into non-traditional vended products like fresh foods or healthy foods.  This market will allow us to focus on the vending retailers with a low cost, no risk solution and allow each machine to pull initial consumers as we advertise promotions. With an initial focus on universities and the surrounding communities we can overcome the early ramp up challenges of focusing on broad, general markets.  Universities are ideal ecosystems for emere; concentrated progressive consumers who are intimately tied to their phones, willing to use new technology, and a large appetite for promotions and discounted products. As consumers opt in to receive special promotions and offers through their mobile device, emere can provide a mechanism for retail vending operators and their suppliers to communicate directly to the consumers in a market that historically has no communication with end consumers. emere offers retail vendors a mechanism for targeting of consumers based on individual buying patterns, purchase history, or location, providing the ability to drive sales of all products or specific products.  Never before have retail vendors been able to drive sales easily nor target offers to individuals or groups.  emere will help retail vendors drive their business while reducing costs.","Commerce and Shopping, Internet Services",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
