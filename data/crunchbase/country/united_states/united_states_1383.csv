We connect patients to their doctors for real-time analysis to improve outcomes and improve the quality of life of patients. This company is inspired by my professional experience as a doctor with 12 years of clinical research experience and my personal experience with my father who was diagnosed with 3 different cancers -- colon, lung, and pancreatic cancer.  From these experiences, I identified a problem.   Doctors want patients to track and report any concerning daily symptoms.  Cancer patients are already stressed.   As a result, patient compliance is poor and inconsistent. The effect of all this is that: some side effects are not reported early become worse, costs go up, treatment takes longer, and patients end up have more stress.
