There is much demand for rehabilitation of injured people, at a global level.    Considering this demand, the implementation is planned on an area of outstanding natural conditions (e.g. thermal water), in the village of Szár, which is 45 kms from the capital. Apart from the artificial limbs that function with bioenergy (artificial leg, artificial arm), the artificial eye, dental and hearing aids implantation is feasible, moreover, on a lower price than in their neighboring countries. One of the pillars of these implementations is the appropriate professional staff whom they have already negotiated successfully.     At the negotiations on investment, a need arose to develop a care home. Due to the thermal water and the rehabilitation activities in the area, it seemed sensible to develop a spa with a hotel.

The majority of food insecure or hungry Americans were working parents, children, senior citizens, veterans, and people with disabilities.   The good news is that effective citizen service—combined with improved public policies—can make a big difference. Working together, concerned individuals, civic organizations, youth groups, congregations, businesses, and elected officials can do their part to ensure that all Americans have access to sufficient, nutritious foods to ensure a healthful, active lifestyle.   Millions of Americans already generously give time and money to fight hunger, but they don’t always know the way to make the greatest impact. That is why ConAgra Foods and the New York City Coalition Against Hunger (NYCCAH) are spearheading a new nationwide initiative called “Ending Hunger Through Citizen Service.”   Starting with this web site, this effort includes concrete tools to help the public engage in volunteerism and for nonprofit groups to effectively harness the energy of such citizen service.","Other, Social Impact",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
