They expect the number of platforms to grow 40% more by the end of the year. This poses many problems for both entrepreneurs and investors in the equity crowdfunding space. First, how will entrepreneurs know which funding platforms would be the best fit for them? Will they have to scour more than 222 platforms to understand what each platform is offering? And how will they be able to quantify their potential for success on each of the platforms? Furthermore, will investors have to go to each of the 222 platforms to search and research companies seeking funding? Where will they find other data that will help them make the most educated investment decisions?  CrowdLanding has the solution to these problems.

There seem to be numerous official reviews for Workplace Compliance Services and it is hard to know exactly which is giving correct information, although none of the sites are very professional either in tone or appearance. Most of the information is written in an extremely over-exaggerated way, it is very repetitive and takes away from the credibility of the company. Workplace Compliance Services does offer a 100% money-back guarantee. If you have trouble keeping up with your own filings, and don’t want to pay your lawyer astronomic fees to keep up with it for you, Workplace Compliance Services is a great and cheaper alternative. Workplace Compliance Services charges much less than the usual lawyer and accountant fees.  Workplace Compliance Services: The Filing Details Workplace Compliance Services is used to help companies stay up-to-date on their business filings. From the information given on the websites and Workplace Compliance Services blog, it is clear that the company knows what they’re talking about. They are educated on the laws and filing requirements for every state, and stay updated on any changes that may occur. When you use Workplace Compliance Services for your filings, you can be assured that they will handle everything for you. Workplace Compliance Services knows that as a small business owner, keeping up with paperwork is tedious and time-consuming. Like they say on their website, the filing services they offer allow business owners to focus on what’s important- actually running their business. Workplace Compliance Services is a human resources B2B company that assists businesses in staying in compliance with the various annual, biennial, and periodic filings that are required of businesses.  There are a lot of reasons that you may choose to use their services. Your business may have a presence in multiple states and you probably don’t want to keep up with each state’s annual filings. Each state has a different due date, fee, and paperwork required and it can be a big job just keeping up with each state’s requirements. Another reason you may choose to use Workplace Compliance Services to handle your annual filings is if you aren’t computer-savvy. I’ve spoken with multiple people who say they prefer to have a service handle their filings now that most states require you to file online.","Financial Services, Information Technology, Other, Professional Services",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Adams, whose imagination was stirred by his wife’s yearning for a flavoring that wouldn’t bake or freeze out, announced that he could produce a better vanilla than the one his wife was currently using. Working with just $6.71 worth of materials on top of an old icebox, Adams discovered the formula he wanted. To test this product, his wife whipped up a cake for the family to try. “John, this is the BEST flavoring I have ever used,” she announced. “Well, that’s old man Adams BEST,” he responded. The name stuck and Adams Best® was born! At night, by the light of kerosene lamps, his sons, Fred and Don, helped their father print labels and bottle the product. During the day, they sold it door to door with the guarantee that if it was not the best vanilla extract the customer had ever used, the company would refund their money, even if the whole bottle was used.","Food and Beverage, Transportation",,,101-250,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
