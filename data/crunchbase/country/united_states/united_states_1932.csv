InsideCounsel's mission is to provide the strategic tools that general counsel need to better manage their legal departments and fully understand the business risks companies face today. The magazine's unique coverage includes benchmarking surveys, examinations of substantive legal issues, regional news and a variety of columns and departments covering such critical areas as litigation, corporate governance, labor and intellectual property. The magazine also hosts SuperConference, an annual two-day conference in Chicago that attracts the best and brightest general counsel in the country. They attend this event to share ideas and best practices, as well as to expand their knowledge and skill sets. In addition to the annual SuperConference, InsideCousel’s legal suite of events also include the Women, Influence & Power in Law Conference and the Transformative Leadership Awards. The Women, Influence and Power in Law conference offers a unique opportunity for unprecedented exchange with women outside counsel. This two day conference is not a forum for lawyers to discuss so-called “women’s issues.” It is a conference for women in-house and outside counsel to discuss current legal topics, bringing their individual experience, perspectives and best practices. Since 2010, the Transformative Leadership Awards honor general counsel and law firm partners who have demonstrated a commitment to advancing the empowerment of women in corporate law.
