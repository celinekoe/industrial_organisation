Many parents find this to be the most objectionable aspect of training a child, and have wished that they could sleep in their own room and be woken up only when the child has an accident. This is the key to our DryBuddy patient-friendly moisture alarm therapy - it wakes the caregiver (sleeping in the privacy of his or her own room) as well as the patient. Parents may also object to having to purchase expendable supplies for use in some wetness sensing systems. The DryBuddy System requires no expendable supplies, thereby creating significant savings while you are using DryBuddy. What you initially purchase - illustrated above - is all that you need to effectively use the DryBuddy System. In addition, the DryBuddy Enuresis System also facilitates keeping proper records for the patient's doctor.","Design, Hardware, Health Care, Mobile",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
