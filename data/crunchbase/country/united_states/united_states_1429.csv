While accountants, bookkeepers, advisors, consultants, management companies, and many other individuals tout services to help you set up and use QuickBooks more effectively, they may not have more than a basic understanding of the software. They may not even know how many useful QuickBooks features you're missing out on because QuickBooks is a surprisingly powerful accounting program. That is where the Quickbooks ProAdvisor consultant certification will come in handy. These professionals have a proven—by passing an exam—expertise in the use of Quickbooks. Different Certifications for ProAdvisor Consultants The Quickbooks ProAdvisor program identifies accounting professionals who can provide insight on the use of QuickBooks for a business or individual. The ProAdvisor can receive four different types of certifications demonstrating different levels of proficiency with QuickBooks and deeper mastery of QuickBooks industry editions. ProAdvisors may choose to take a certain number of hours of training—in-person in a classroom or online—or they can bypass any instruction and sit directly in the exam to get certified. QuickBooks Certification A QuickBooks ProAdvisor can receive a basic QuickBooks Certification. To get this certification, the ProAdvisor must successfully complete a certification exam. The exam covers topics such as QuickBooks installation, setup, recording transactions, and financial reporting. While candidates must score 85% to pass the exam, they get six chances to pass. If a candidate does not pass, they will be given the questions that were incorrect. Pro: This basic certification will give you some assurance that your ProAdvisor will have at least a basic proficiency with QuickBooks. Con: A ProAdvisor who holds only this certification may have learned how to pass an exam on QuickBooks through trial and error, not from a thorough understanding of the program. Remember that candidates get six attempts to pass the exam.",,,,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Today, they have the Internet, which lets them watch any music video any time they want to and gives them instant music news and interviews. The stations couldn't compete. They turned to reality shows and dropped the music from their brands. At the same time, the Internet also made watching music videos a lot more complicated. Now, they have to find them amongst digital noise, and dispersed amongst viral videos. Worse, they have to manage their playlists, manage their playlist manager, deal with repeats and skipping, and so on. That's not fun. Sometimes, it's just better to do nothing.

Every day, millions of test strips are used in order to make a myriad of chemistry of measurements. Many of these strips rely on user interpretation of colors or indicator lines in order to make estimations of analyte concentrations. For this reason, test strips are often viewed as “semi-quantitative” or even just simply “qualitative.” We realize that there exists tremendous opportunity to leverage the native capabilities of today’s smartphones with their massive install bases in order to convert “quick-and-dirty” test strips to powerful tools for rapid quantitative measurement. Our platform, LabStrip, is designed to transform the iPhone 4 series of smartphone into a deployable mobile laboratory. Each lot of test strips is meticulously calibrated in our laboratory using liquid standards of known value and the resultant calibration file is downloaded to the phone by scanning a QR code applied to each box of strips we sell. The user is able to make instant measurements in the field with no calibration required because we use the exact same LabStrip meters to calibrate and release product. We then feed the measurements from the LabStrip App to our cloud storage center, LabCloud, where it can be married with a host of other metadata for later data mining by the user. In addition to high-quality measurements, the iPhone 4 provides GPS location, date/time stamps, and the option to add annotations.","Hardware, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Having been a Registered Environmental Assessor (REA) since 1994,  I knew that stormwater treatment systems approved for LID compliance with the lowest possible project life cost would be a market growth driver and was determined to provide better ways to meet those needs with patented systems and methods.  We now have two issued and three pending patents for just such treatment systems, also suitable for licensing to others for manufacture, including lightweight units which can be shipped directly to any job site..        SFC also has the trademark HYDRO-MASTER®, and its website is already familiar to southern California civil engineers and regulators.         It’s time now for SFC to be funded to build/test systems for capture of bacteria and dissolved contaminants and expand our marketing outreach to achieve real market share;      In the five years since founding,  SFC has: 1.     Designed, developed, and tested methods and equipment for the direct or subcontract manufacture of stormwater treatment equipment for job site compliance with national environmental regulations. 2.     Formed relationships with civil engineers tasked with specifying storm water treatment equipment so that representative installations of SFC systems could be accomplished and customer satisfaction established. 3.     Accomplished testing of SFC products to obtain use approval from compliance regulators.   4.     Established a trademark for branding of SFC products.  5.

My husband Daren and I are not new to the online buying and selling experience. We started selling on Ebay in December 2000 and grew shortly thereafter into Ebay Powersellers. This eventually helped us start our own enterprise and thus things got so busy for us that it turned into a full-time job. It wasn't until the last few years that things began to change on Ebay(hike in fees, feedback, how to sell, etc.)that gave us the idea to start our own online marketplace but without all the ridiculous dictations. We desire for Bidzinger to bring BACK the 'MAGIC' online auctions once had when Ebay first began. We WELCOME the mom and pop stores, the handcrafted items and things that once made Ebay fresh and very unique. We desire to see small business people grow with us into something big like Ebay had helped us to do 8 years ago. Somebody had asked me a few years ago when we first got started, ""There are several auction sites out there that have started up and a lot of them are no longer around..what makes you think YOU are going to be any different?"" Well, #1, we have put a lot of money on this website and with that thought, we have not just let this site go live without putting some of our own items on and continuously trying to build it up week by week along with other sellers that have joined with us. We have EVERY intention in becoming competitive and growing quickly! #2, we desire to also be like buyers and utilize our site just like anyone would if they owned a site or a store and that is to buy off of our own people. If we see something we could use for our business or around the house or perhaps something to purchase as a gift for someone at Christmas time, we are going to DO it! We desire to see unique sellers on our website making tons and tons of sales and doing great things with us! #3, we are going to and have been the last few months promoting and advertising Bidzinger in several different ways and things seem to be working great so far! #4, we are so sick and tired of sites like Ebay and others that think they have the right to get involved in the sellers business telling them what payments they can accept, how they need to ship, etc. We are not like that. You can accept payments HOWEVER you wish, ship to WHOMEVER you wish, and SELL to whomever you wish. That is YOUR decision; not ours. And that's the way it always should be.

In todays high speed world of Internet based advertising and marketing, it is surprising that so many businesses miss the opportunity to connect with their customers and convert hits into action and sales, despite many sites and name brands having huge search engine traffic.  Not only should a website serve as an informational repository about a business or product, it should also generate a call to action for the consumer to visit the shop stocking the products, or buy online using the web or mobile tools many of which are either available today or are just being brought to market.  Further, they should properly leverage the power of social marketing and the other tools that are being adopted by the leaders in the field.  The Bizzability platform has been developed to offer access to many of the latest tools that allow improved and effective web and mobile engagement in a modular and template format that utilize many of the latest tools and technologies available today.  Many of these tools are being used by some of the largest and most successful retailers, but with a huge investment of dollars and staffing.  Bizzability brings all of these tools together for the first time in a single platform that is uniquely scale-able and available for fast deployment across differing channels, markets and products. In addition to these tools, we have developed a highly innovative and unique Master Online Bizzability Shopping System (MOBSS).  This will open up online shopping to brands that have never considered selling products online in the past.   This will address two major business concerns: first the need to compete with the large online stores like Amazon and E-Bay, and second, to encourage customers to visit brick and mortar retail shops.","Advertising, Commerce and Shopping, Internet Services, Mobile, Sales and Marketing",1,Guy Kennett,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Private,,,,,,
