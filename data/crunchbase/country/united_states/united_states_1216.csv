Our algorithm recommends an optimized mix of schools to apply to -- including dream, reach, match, and safety schools -- based on a student's grades, test scores, and school preferences. It's the same kind of advice you'd get from talking to a good college counselor for an hour, except it's online, it's free, and it takes less than five minutes. ApplyMap was founded by two UCLA graduate students, Dan Lim and Steve Palley, in the summer of 2013. As teaching assistants in the Department of Political Science, they spent a lot of time teaching UCLA undergraduates. After a while they noticed a pattern: their students were all smart and hard working, but the very best of the best -- the ones who really stood out from the crowd -- were often from less affluent backgrounds. These students had the academic talent and drive to get into a great school like UCLA, but they were also lucky, because college admissions isn’t a level playing field. The competition is fierce, and naturally, applicants use every tool at their disposal to succeed. For every one of the lucky ones who made it into a school like UCLA, how many other great students had missed out on getting into the best possible school for them, simply because they couldn’t afford to hire expert help to guide them through the process? We built ApplyMap to answer this question. We want to fill the growing need for high quality college advice in an intelligent, intuitive and affordable way. Our job is to help as many students as we can understand the possibilities and risks when applying to college. The more you know before you apply, the better off you’ll be when the fat envelopes start to arrive… and we want to celebrate with you when they do!","Data and Analytics, Education",2,"Dan Lim, Steve Palley",1-10,1,Seed,90000,USD,90000,90000,USD,90000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

RAD has a small staff of really smart programmers that can code, write documentation, and provide great technical support. Unlike most companies, they want their smart people working on documentation and supporting their customers - that's the way their products get better! After all, how would they know if the documentation needed clarification if they didn't talk to the developers? How would they know if some API was too complicated without trying to walk someone through it over the phone? It is this circle of development (code->documentation->support->code) that they think makes their products unique. When you use their products, it should feel like an API that you designed yourself. Further, all of their developers are long-term game development veterans. Some of us have been working in the game industry for 20 years! They know what you are going through, because they've been there theirselves. RAD also does a fair amount of consulting on both game software and game hardware projects, working on major products for Intel, Microsoft, and others.

The technology is able to assign up to 250 claims in seconds, where it would take the average supervisor 22-27 hours to assign the same number. IAE positively impacts every critical cost component of insurance claims management through its ability to utilize real-time information to automate triage, routing, and assignment workflows. Insurance carriers’ experience reductions in total claims handling expenses by up to $1000 per claim by minimizing overall cycle time, vehicle and fuel expenses, litigation, and fraud expenses - as well as an increase in customer satisfaction and retention. Claimatic’s competitive advantage derives from the uniqueness of IAE as the only application available that offers the power of sophisticated claims assignment optimization through a cloud-based SaaS solution: * IAE delivers operational efficiency and cost reduction using multi-factor analysis and predictive analytics to generate optimized, real-time claims routing and assignment decisions. * IAE was designed to enhance - not replace - insurance carriers’ existing software investments. IAE can be integrated with existing claims management systems and deployed in 60 days, without the need for manual on-site updates, training time, and lengthy client involvement during rollout and updates.","Apps, Financial Services, Information Technology, Software, Transportation",1,Larry Cochran,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
