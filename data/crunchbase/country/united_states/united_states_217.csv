After all, pre-owned fine timepieces already took their biggest depreciation hit when the first buyer left the retail store. And since high-end watches are built to last several lifetimes, the only thing you’re really missing by buying an authentic watch in great condition from the secondary market is the hefty retail price tag.  However, just like any secondary market, there are some precautions to take to ensure that you’re getting your money’s worth. The pre-owned luxury watch space is a robust market with plenty of sources to buy and sell used timepieces. But, how do you know if the seller is a trustworthy one and more importantly, how do you know if the watch you’re buying is the real deal? Enter WatchFacts, a third-party certification program that does all the work for you so you know exactly what you’re buying.   Just like customers depend on Carfax reports to inform them about the history of a used car, WatchFacts provides detailed certification reports about secondhand luxury watches. Using a proprietary grading system and a standardized inspection process, a WatchFacts Report includes a WatchFacts Score, which gives you a quick overview of the overall condition of the watch.  A top WatchFacts Score of 100 indicates that the watch is in unworn/like new condition, followed by different scores for excellent, very good, and so on. Along with the score, a WatchFacts Report provides other essential information such as brand, model, date of production, movement, materials, authenticity check, theft check, current performance, and information about any previous servicing.  Buying from a WatchFacts partner network minimizes your risk when purchasing from the secondary luxury watch market since you’ll have access to a WatchFacts Report. Plus, seeing as WatchFacts’ goal is customer peace of mind, if something goes wrong, WatchFacts will intercede on your behalf so you are content with your purchase.  Shoppers can take advantage of a vast selection of products by buying certified pre-owned luxury watches from Amazon, eBay, and Jomashop. Every watch listed as “Certified Pre-Owned” on Amazon and Jomashop comes with a one-year limited warranty and a WatchFacts Report so you can rest assured that the timepiece delivered to your doorstep will meet all your expectations. Furthermore, pre-owned timepieces offered by Kay Jewelers, Jared, and Zales have all been inspected by WatchFacts.  With a WatchFacts report in hand, buying a pre-owned luxury watch is no longer a guessing game but now it’s a safe, secure, and transparent process.
