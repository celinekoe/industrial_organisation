Once found, it commands its relay to transfer the power from the mains to your light bulb and voila – there’s light (or darkness). VOCCA is focused on real life application rather than being “cool” for a week.  Anyone can install VOCCA, as it requires no wifi, no hub and no configuration. The regular light switch still works when VOCCA is connected so habits don't need to change. It's a product for life as you don't need to buy a new one when your bulb dies. VOCCA uses some of the best technology to date. VOCCA is based on voice recognition technology from Sensory Inc., the world's leading voice recognition technology company. VOCCA Pro uses TobyRich Bluetooth Smart and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) app design. VOCCA uses Bluetooth LE to connect to an app on your smartphone. VOCCA screws in between the original volt socket and the light bulb, and comes equipped with a microphone and a Bluetooth chip.

Our proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms hoover up information from all over the Web. We then apply the science of service quality to transform that data into actionable intelligence. The result is a performance report that is free of the inherent human bias so common in other cloud provider review sites and analyst reports. FY/c's reporting does this by looking at all of the evidence to come up a determination of service performance. FY/c also uses it's algorithms to help buyers figure out which attributes -- not features -- of a cloud service such as high security or 24/7 support are right for them. This needs assessment tool asks buyers a series of questions that focus not on particular feature set but on the appropriateness of the service for their company. This knowledge helps buyers choose the right provider for their needs, not on their wants. As cloud-provided software and services become the norm, choosing the right cloud provider can mean the difference between a business reaching its goals or not.

It was formed in 2006 to commercialize the patented wireless sensor infrastructure technology developed at NASA for the Department of Homeland Security by company founder, Dr. Kevin Delin. SensorWare Systems provides solutions for active, real-time situational awareness and decision making.  The technological core of these solutions, the Sensor Web, consists of a collection of small sensor platforms (pods) connected to sensors which measure environmental parameters.  These pods are spread across a geographical area and communicate with each other wirelessly.  Unlike mesh networks, there are no routers or gateways; the Sensor Web is a single, distributed instrument.  Every pod knows all the data across the system and can act as a portal.  Each pod is like a pixel in the snapshot the Sensor Web takes.  This form of communication gives the Sensor Web unprecedented power in in-field interpretation of and reacting to a dynamically changing environment. Sensor Webs have been fielded by first responders monitoring hazardous gases and structural integrity in compromised buildings and by the EPA in decontamination operations.  Because any sensor can be connected to a pod, Sensor Webs are also valuable for environmental conservation and management solutions including water resource management and enabling green solutions of power generation.  The turn-key systems require little training and seamlessly integrate with remote decision tools.  Additional information about some of SensorWare Systems' over 30 real-world deployments in demanding environments, as well as live, streaming data from current deployments, can be found at www.SensorWareSystems.com.","Agriculture and Farming, Privacy and Security",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
