MTO has purposefully maintained a low-leverage environment and eschewed the high-leverage model adopted by many firms. MTO believes their one-to-one overall partner-to-associate ratio instills a work ethic that results in a cost-effective approach for their clients. In every representation, their 200 lawyers are expected to make a difference in developing and implementing strategies to obtain the best results for the client.  In a survey conducted by The American Lawyer, clients said they called on MTO in “precedent-setting cases that require a creative mind.” Where resources are needed, the survey noted that we are able to deploy an “army of trial lawyers capable of waging war.”  MTO is involved in some of the most high-profile legal cases in the country and count among their clients Bank of America, Transocean, Edison International, Verizon, Rambus, Oaktree Capital Management, KB Home, LG Display, Yucaipa Cos. and Berkshire Hathaway.

MTO is proud to count among their lawyers one of the top 19 trial lawyers in the country as identified by Chambers USA, as well as one of the Daily Journal’s “Ten Top Lawyers of the Decade.”  MTO has been consistently ranked on The American Lawyer’s A-List since its inception in 2004, including four years in the top spot. This annual ranking of the nation’s elite law firms ranks on the basis of financial strength, diversity, pro bono work and attorney satisfaction.

Instead of accepting that as the landlord for 5 separate tenants, you will spend countless sleepless nights coordinating maintenance efforts, ensuring utility bills are paid, ensuring  association fees are paid, ensuring you have received each tenants rent, let us handle it for you.  Rather than directly purchasing properties in an environment that could be strange to you,  invest your capital with Phillips H&M Co.  We will take care of acquiring the properties themselves.  We will handle finding the tenants,  We will collect their dues, pay the bills, and take the phone calls.  You will receive a monthly divined check, sort of like a stock.  This check will be made out for 75% of what your properties generate in revenue monthly.  Lets say a $100,000 investment property brings in $1200/month.  You receive, in your pocket, $900 dollars per month occupied.  That means in only 9 years, your investment has turned over.  You have already made your initial investment back and are now on the fast track to profit.

I came to the U.S. in the year 1998, studied at (SDSU) and worked for Genband and other startup companies including Spatial Wireless, one of the most successful startup companies in Dallas, TX. This is when the seed of entrepreneurship was sown in my heart. Inspired by many of my mentors, I decided to start something of my own. For the last 8+ years, I have been successfully running my own company called DevelopScripts.com. Its main selling brand Auctionsoftware.com has made $2.3 Million in 2021 with 30% NET revenues and 19.2% CAGR over a period of 5 years. DevelopScripts.com has two major products: Auctionsoftware.com – Enterprise solution with an extensive customizable white-label solution for fortune 500 companies to solve their auction needs. Auction.io – A SaaS Model through which anyone can create their own marketplace like eBay in 60 minutes. It also has the “Live Auction” facility that allows companies to conduct a live auction on their own website rather than using another heavy subscription-driven third-party website. It has 100K bidders’ DB to support the audience needs of its customers. Auction software is an intensive white-label solution for any industry’s auction needs covering automobiles, electronics, livestock, liquidation, pharmaceutical, and so forth. Its flawless robust product can accommodate Forward Auction, Reverse Auction, Penny Auction, and Silent Auction using 8 different bidding methods with the latest technology stack namely node.js and REACT.js. We stand alone in the Auction market due to the usage of these latest technologies to support the microsecond bidding with thousands of bidders bidding at the same time! We have implemented our software product to 500s of successful customers in various markets. Our core technology “bidding engine” was built in 2014 with extensive R&D. AuctionSoftware customer includes GM, Somos, IngramMicro, DPWorld, NDTV, ITOCHU, Songvest, Doorsey, Slibuy, NellisAuction, Dealbadger, ipigeon, FullBasket and many Fortune 500 companies. I have come a long way in this entrepreneur journey. It’s my passion, commitment, and visionary perspective that keep me driven and focused to keep achieving my goals. But starting a company from scratch and leading it towards the pinnacle of success was not easy as an entrepreneur. Starting my own venture was not easy, especially with $1,000, setting up my venture in a garage, building the team, maturing the technology, keeping track of the versions of software products as well as maintaining the quality to sustain the competitive market with best customer support. Despite all the odds, I managed to carve a niche within the industry through my strong leadership, clarity of vision, Integrity, commitment and focus on customer satisfaction. As a leader, I emphasize on admiring and inspiring team members and attaining team compatibility while valuing the journey. With all the technology and innovations around, one thing the business leader prioritizes above all is my team. I believe that employees are the most critical assets of a company since the success of an organization rests on their shoulders. As mentioned, my team and I are the backbones of the company to derive a successful robust product. We all inspire each other and admire each other to deliver the best in the market. The trust that the team has in me makes me accountable and responsible for their dreams and aspirations in the tech field. Moving ahead, We aspire to make the SaaS product Auction.io,  big and synergize with a bigger firm or get funded to make the journey of Auction.io more meaningful. Sellers from Ebay, Amazon, TopHatter, Whatnot and Live Auctioneer should think about setting their own domains, capturing their sellers and doing live Auction on their own site instead of renting in big places. With our 100K bidders they can accelerate building their own brand and sell in other platforms as well via Auction.io. In long run building your own house is better than renting some where. We just solve that problem.","Commerce and Shopping, Software",1,Rajesh Rajaram,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

In 2015 Baltimore, Maryland-based federal contractor Tidewater, Inc  was looking for an automation solution to help them manage 650 vendors and thousands of monthly invoices. After researching products in the market, they realized that most were just too big, too expensive, or put far too much burden of implementation on their small AP team. They wanted a solution that would not only help them to stem the growth of their AP department, but something that would enhance communication with their vendors. Prasad Dissanayake, President of Tidewater and engineer by profession, tapped friend and software engineer, Dimuthu Roshan, in Sri Lanka to recruit a development team to build what would eventually become PaperTrl. In less than one year the software transformed the Tidewater AP function. Payback came quickly as Tidewater saw huge increases in AP efficiencies. Due to its popularity among users and vendors, Tidewater decided to commercialize PaperTrl. Prasad chose software industry veteran Steve Weber as CEO. Steve had spent most of his career leading software companies that were focused on developing, marketing and supporting integration solutions for ERP and accounting software. As such he came with many years’ experience in the Intuit, SAGE, Microsoft Dynamics, Oracle, and SAP communities. Shilpa Marano joined the team as COO having worked with Steve at integration startup nChannel and IBM Sterling Commerce. Shilpa brought years of experience building successful marketing and product teams. Together with Dimuthu now serving as CIO, Steve and Shilpa were able to direct PaperTrl’s functionality to address an area of the market that was being underserved – specifically, an easy to implement, easy to use, but highly functional AP automation solution at an affordable price.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment, Software",2,"Shilpa Marano, Steve Weber",11-50,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,Archangels,1,1,,Private,,,,,,

Turn 10 is a subdivision of Microsoft Studios, established in 2001 as a first-party racing game developer. Turn 10 Studios began working on the original Forza Motorsport to fill the void of simulation racing games on the Xbox console. With an emphasis on driving mechanics and the newest features of Xbox LIVE, the original Forza Motorsport was released in May of 2005 to much critical acclaim and community support.  Building off its success, Turn 10’s team immediately began working on a sequel intended to be released on Microsoft’s new Xbox 360 console. Forza Motorsport 2 was released in May of 2007, pushing the boundaries of User Generated Content (UGC) with a robust livery editor and online Auction House, giving casual players new options for expressing their creativity on and off the track. With new online tools, the Forza community thrived as painters, tuners, seller, and racers shared their creations via Forzamotorsport.net.  In late 2007, Turn 10 Studios began an intense development process for the next Forza installment. Their most ambitious project to date, Forza Motorsport 3 boasted enhanced graphics, driving physics, and UGC. Turn 10 released the game in October 2009 to critical and commercial success.  Released in October of 2011, Forza Motorsport 4 brought even more excitement to the franchise with Kinect integration, including the stunning Autovista experience. With hundreds of cars rendered in stunning detail, and new tracks to hone skills on, Forza Motorsport 4 was another resounding success for Turn 10 Studios.  With Forza Horizon, the Forza universe has expanded to the open road. Action racing puts the player in an open world that demands driving skill and rewards driving style. With lots to explore and a cutting-edge soundtrack to compliment the scenery, Horizon is the latest evolution of the authentic Forza experience. Horizon was released in late October 2012.  Turn 10 Studios has always been dedicated to pushing this franchise to new heights while delivering truly incredible experiences for car enthusiasts of all types. They would like to thank their community and fans, new and old, for their support in helping us achieve their goals.","Community and Lifestyle, Gaming, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Software, Sports",1,Dan Greenawalt,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
