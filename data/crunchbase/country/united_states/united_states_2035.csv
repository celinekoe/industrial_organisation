That’s why we have dedicated ourselves to helping people by fighting for their right to immigrate to this country and especially here in Oakland, California, where we’re located. Whether that means serving as deportation defense lawyers, fighting to get you asylum, or battling to ensure that family immigration does not tear apart those same families it is looking to help, Landerholm Immigration, A.P.C. is ready to stand up for you. We also understand that it is important to protect those noncitizens that are already on US soil. This means protecting women through the VAWA and helping keep your children safe through DACA initiatives. We strive to make coming to and living in the United States of America a positive experience so that those we help can spread the word that our country truly cares for those it welcomes inside. Whether it is as simple as applying for a visa, or as complicated as fighting against a deportation order, our Oakland-located immigration attorneys understand that we are not just fighting court battles. We’re fighting to make the country a better, stronger, and more accepting place and the best way to do that is by opening our doors and inviting people like you inside. We aim to make a stressful experience easier by providing answers, advice, and the caring and capable advocacy you need in tackling US immigration law.
