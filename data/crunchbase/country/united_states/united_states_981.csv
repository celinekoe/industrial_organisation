While traveling to promote his WristWrap glove invention, McCrane sat next to an associate of 8-time Mr. Olympia Lee Haney.  After a long chat, McCrane realized the opportunity for the WristWrap technology in weight training gloves. McCrane developed a line of weight training gear using Haney as inspiration which quickly positioned Harbinger as a force in the fitness market.  Harbinger and Haney worked together to broaden Harbinger’s brand awareness with lifters and fitness enthusiasts.

Our initial focus is on developing cloud-based applications for the management of solar photovoltaic facilities ranging in size from small residential rooftop systems to multi-megawatt utility-scale power plants. Between 2011 and 2012, the solar industry grew 76% and is expect to grow approximately 30% year-over-year from now until the end of 2016. By then, the U.S. could have nearly 1 million individual solar installations. For those assets installed under a Third-Party Ownership (TPO) model – approximately 85% of the total – there exists a unique set of management requirements: performance benchmarking, billing and ticketing, vendor workflow communication, and reporting, among others. Performing these vital back-office functions for a portfolio of hundreds or thousands of small power plants requires a new set of software tools, unlike those built for the conventional power industry. Energy Informatics has built these tools. We have built the Energy Informatics Back Office Suite so that solar financiers, integrators, and service providers can manage fast-growing fleets of small power plants better, faster, and cheaper with minimal personnel. We provide these capabilities in the cloud. It’s the best way to deliver software to an industry growing fast across multiple markets and a changing regulatory landscape. We handle the complexity.
