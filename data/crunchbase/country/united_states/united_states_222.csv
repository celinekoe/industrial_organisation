One group is PEP Moto Italia, which owns 4 motorcycle brands plus the engineering consulting group ItaliaCeleste. The parent company is seeking funding for expansion of their brands into global markets, with in-house design, production and marketing services provided by the consulting group. One of their brands has been producing high-performance motorcycles since 1958, and has competed in International Grand Prix motorcycle racing the last four decades.    PEP Moto has secured exclusive rights to production and distribution of new clean-burn engine technology worldwide.
