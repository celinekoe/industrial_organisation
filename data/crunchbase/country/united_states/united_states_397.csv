Deregulation and ever falling computing costs are steadily increasing competition in financial services, potentially benefiting consumers. Lower priced, higher quality financial products are increasingly available. Unfortunately, access to more good products hasn’t helped people figure out which ones to buy. People need independent advice to make sound choices in their own best interest. But the sales commissions paid by some financial products provide incentives for salespeople to sell products that produce large commissions for themselves, not necessarily the ones that best fill the needs of their customers.Declining computing costs have enabled experts in financial planning and investment strategy to translate their approaches into computer software. This software’s strength – leading-edge customized advice – can’t overcome its weakness – people often don’t understand how complex software works and are unwilling to rely on the results. However, there is enormous potential – a skilled advisor can harness the software’s full power to deliver high-quality advice tailored to each client’s circumstances at a reasonable price. They use the best software available to develop and deliver advice systematically, and efficiently.

In the area of wisdom, it promotes East-West dialogue and a proper understanding of the Indian civilization, particularly in the United States and India. The world today is grappling with issues arising from globalization, religious conflicts and economic, ecological and cultural challenges. Infinity Foundation believes that the experience and wisdom of the Indian civilization can play a positive role in an inter-civilization dialogue based on harmonious co-existence. The foundation seeks to create dialogue that breaks out of the dualities of anti- and pro- globalization forces, of the right vs. the left, of secularism vs. religion, of science vs. spirituality, of economic growth vs. ecological preservation. Globalization can be a positive force but it cannot simply be translated to Westernization of the planet – in cultural norms, in academic frameworks, in knowledge systems and in definitions of progress and patterns of development. To do so has enormous ecological implications in both biological and cultural terms. To create a global family, a “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam”, requires that indigenous non-Western civilizations get a seat on the table as equals in crafting the frameworks of discourse, rather than simply being used as exotic artifacts to be plugged into an overall Euro-Centric framework. Revitalizing the Indic discourse and helping India find its own voice in this dialogue is a key part of the mission.","Health Care, Other, Social Impact",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Throughout the clinic's existence, their doctors have treated over 10,000 patients, and over 2,300 of those patients were treated in FDA approved clinical trials.

The project has been in the works for years, and it is presently able to break ground as soon as it can be capitalized. Its owner, Alejandro Franceschi, has gone above and beyond the negotiation of tax incentives of 40% for production and post production of: motion pictures, series, streaming, broadcast, interactive, xr and more. While additional aspects will not be discussed without an NDA, he can legally make use of various tax treaties and currency exchanges that further reduce risk, overhead, and costs; even if the ForEx involved were to collapse by more than 20%, the project would remain highly profitable. Alejandro has personally negotiated on behalf of the governments of several friendly countries to the USA, and has documented proof from various agencies and departments related to the effort: all stamped, signed, scanned, and with the originals in sealed and untampered envelopes.  Presently, through his company, he has secured a guarantee of more than $150 million USD in venture capital that will be repaid, in full down to the penny, guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the governments involved via their reserve banks. Alternatively, the tax return(s) can be provided as tax credits, good for two years. This type may be sold at a profit, should investors opt not to utilize it for themselves. Interested parties account for over $1 billion USD worth of revenue within the first 12-18 months. Provided the requisite expansions remain on time, including other project aspects that must remain under NDA, revenue forecasts for the facilities should reach a reliably steady $2 billion+ USD, annually. Depending on the structuring of the deal, Alejandro and his associates would take over the project as owners. They would also assume any associated debt, if any, so they may remain to operate the studios without interruption. Alejandro welcomes venture capitalists seeking the quintessential dream of no risk and all reward, to schedule an appointment, so he may present the project, answer any questions, and assuage any doubts. The amount of investment capital the project requires is $250 million USD. Tempest Digital, Inc. is an S-Corp founded in 2006. Alejandro holds all one million shares of its stock, and is presently headquartered in San Francisco, California.","Content and Publishing, Gaming, Hardware, Media and Entertainment, Professional Services, Science and Engineering, Software, Video",1,Alejandro Franceschi,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
