The innovative idea of treating pathologically proliferating, non-electrically excitable cells by targeting an ion channel has already shown success in preclinical studies and is being tested in Phase 1 safety and dose-finding clinical trials in brain cancer. Their technology is intended to magnify the effects of combined chemotherapy, radiation, and targeted therapies for all solid tumor cancers.

Heartland's additives enable manufacturers to reduce their carbon footprint by upwards of 50% in the first 3 years while reducing the cost of goods. Over time, it's become clear that all of the materials we rely on every day have a really high carbon footprint. This means that it's our responsibility to figure out how we can collectively reduce the negative impact that these raw materials have on our planet. As a natural fiber processor, we work with farmers, manufacturers, and their suppliers to embed high-performance carbon-negative additives into various raw material supply chains.  Almost everything that can be seen or touched is made from plastic, rubber, foam, wood, paper, ceramic, or building materials. Infusing natural fiber additives into these existing raw materials allows manufacturers to increase the performance and reduce the carbon footprint of the products they're already manufacturing. Join us in a carbon negative future.","Agriculture and Farming, Manufacturing, Science and Engineering, Sustainability",2,"Jesse Henry, Tim Almond",11-50,3,Seed,1000000,USD,1000000,1660000,USD,1660000,Natural Resources Conservation Service,1,1,,Private,,,,,,

The Oberon production units use various feedstocks—such as biogas (animal and food waste, wastewater treatment, landfills), natural gas, and stranded gas—and they produce 3,000–10,000 gallons of DME per day. The Oberon process cost-effectively converts methane to DME, resulting in stable pricing (not dependent on crude oil), at a price that is competitive with diesel. The modular design can be deployed to remote stranded-gas locations that can be difficult and expensive to harvest, and to industrial operations where our units can monetize waste CO2 streams. These small-scale Oberon production units enable the development of regional fuel markets that service local customers engaged in regional haul, so initially we bypass the need for a national infrastructure.  In addition, capital expenditures are in sync with market growth. As the DME market develops, more small-scale production units will be deployed in each region and new regions will be added across North America. While DME has been in development for several decades, market forces such as increasing emission regulations, the spread between natural gas and crude oil pricing, and innovations in processing technology make now an exciting time to commercialize DME particularly in the heavy-duty trucking sector. Oberon Fuels will be the first to market in North America.","Agriculture and Farming, Energy, Manufacturing, Natural Resources",1,Elliot Hicks,11-50,3,,205155,USD,205155,3105155,USD,3105155,"California Energy Commission, Suburban Propane, Blackbird Ventures",2,3,,Private,,,,,,
