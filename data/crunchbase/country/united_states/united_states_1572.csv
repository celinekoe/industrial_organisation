The innovative idea of treating pathologically proliferating, non-electrically excitable cells by targeting an ion channel has already shown success in preclinical studies and is being tested in Phase 1 safety and dose-finding clinical trials in brain cancer. Their technology is intended to magnify the effects of combined chemotherapy, radiation, and targeted therapies for all solid tumor cancers. Their neurology program uses superior chemistry and clinical expertise to deliver a novel class of drugs that will provide patients with treatments for neurologic diseases.  While Cav3 is an established target in neurology, particularly neuropathic pain, Cavion is working to bring the first non-addictive, non-opioid T-type calcium channel antagonist to patients with neuropathic pain.

The Oberon production units use various feedstocksâsuch as biogas (animal and food waste, wastewater treatment, landfills), natural gas, and stranded gasâand they produce 3,000â10,000 gallons of DME per day. The Oberon process cost-effectively converts methane to DME, resulting in stable pricing (not dependent on crude oil), at a price that is competitive with diesel. The modular design can be deployed to remote stranded-gas locations that can be difficult and expensive to harvest, and to industrial operations where our units can monetize waste CO2 streams. These small-scale Oberon production units enable the development of regional fuel markets that service local customers engaged in regional haul, so initially we bypass the need for a national infrastructure.  In addition, capital expenditures are in sync with market growth. As the DME market develops, more small-scale production units will be deployed in each region and new regions will be added across North America. While DME has been in development for several decades, market forces such as increasing emission regulations, the spread between natural gas and crude oil pricing, and innovations in processing technology make now an exciting time to commercialize DME particularly in the heavy-duty trucking sector. Oberon Fuels will be the first to market in North America.","Agriculture and Farming, Energy, Manufacturing, Natural Resources",1,Elliot Hicks,11-50,3,,205155,USD,205155,3105155,USD,3105155,"California Energy Commission, Suburban Propane, Blackbird Ventures",2,3,,Private,,,,,,
