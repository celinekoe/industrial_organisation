Button Brew House intends to produce an eclectic array of micro-brewed beers along with creating a warm and inviting atmosphere like no other that features appeal for every Craft Beverage lover that walks through the doors. Currently, Craft Breweries in Tucson either serve an extensive food menu, none at all or have food trucks at their site. Button Brew House will have a different approach, bringing the local community closer. It plans to collaborate with local restaurants and have food delivered to patrons at the Button Brew House location, utilizing up-to-date technology such as mobile applications. Button Brew House plans to have the location a few miles away from most of the other Craft Breweries by opening in a newly developing area that is in the target market of Craft Beer lovers from the ages of 25-54 with disposable income. To create a neighborhood feel, Button Brew House will encourage artists and musicians to showcase their talents. Artists will be able to display their work on the tasting room walls with information regarding the local artists and compete to be the next beer label design. Live music will be featured 1-2 nights a week and on evenings that show low attendance to boost sales and patrons. And finally, Button Brew House will create an atmosphere where people want to work by offering comprehensive benefits, pay and training to gain thorough knowledge of the Craft Beer they are serving. We need people who are willing to stand up for better ideas, and the solution is simple if you want better businesses and better communities, just do it. Be a better business, make a better product, contribute to building a better community.
