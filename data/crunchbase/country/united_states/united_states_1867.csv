Founded in 2007, co-owners Colin McCrate and Brad Halm wanted to apply their years of horticultural and agricultural expertise to help aspiring growers get projects off the ground or more accurately; in the ground: so they bought a truck, grabbed some shovels and got to work. Over the past eight years, we have helped guide hundreds of urban farmers through the design, construction and management of their own edible landscape. We work with our clients through the entire design/build process because we believe that cohesion and attention to detail are what make each project special and successful.  We pride ourselves on creating environmentally responsible and long-lasting garden elements. Sourcing quality materials and locally adapted plants ensures the long-term health and beauty of our landscapes.     Starting out as a two-man operation, SUFCo now has 15 urban farmers, each with unique skills and experience.  Our skilled staff and comprehensive approach allows us to create sustainable edible landscapes that are successful on a wide variety of sites and scales. We are committed to the immediate and ongoing success of all of our projects, focusing on intensive plantings and organic soil management to ensure high yields of crops season after season. Year after year we build new edible landscapes, manage dozens of backyard and rooftop urban farms and teach numerous classes and workshops across the region. With each new year, we find new opportunities and as public awareness of urban agriculture continues to grow, we hope to grow along with it and with you!
