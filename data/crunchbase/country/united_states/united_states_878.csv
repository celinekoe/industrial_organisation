At the time, the Chamber focused its efforts on several main priorities: bringing railroads into San Diego; encouraging settlement in the area; bringing fresh drinking water to residents; and supporting commerce in the harbor. The Chamber also played a critical role in bringing military bases into the region prior to World War I. It was these efforts that helped the military become a driving force for San Diego’s local economy. Throughout San Diego’s history, the Chamber has made significant contributions to the San Diego we know and love. In 1909, Balboa Park stood as a mere 1,400 acres of sagebrush until the Chamber raised funds to make it one of San Diego’s largest tourist destination and cultural center points. Likewise, in 1962, the Chamber’s Harbor Committee helped pass legislation that would ultimately help complete the construction of the Coronado Bay Bridge in 1969. Today, the Chamber is the largest nonprofit advocate for the San Diego regional business community. With nearly 3,000 members representing 400,000 employees, the Chamber is actively involved in local government, regional economic development and providing valuable resources to its members. OUR VISION The San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce aims to be the most influential business network, advocate and resource for growing commerce in the San Diego region. OUR MISSION  To serve our member businesses and employees representing all sectors throughout the San Diego region;To provide opportunities to enhance our members best business interests through networking, advocacy and business resources; and,To partner with our members and other organizations to make the San Diego region more prosperous.","Commerce and Shopping, Natural Resources, Sustainability",,,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

You can pay an auto mechanic a little now for routine maintenance, or pay them a lot more later for a major repair.  The same idea holds true for your air conditioner or heat pump. If you don’t service your air conditioner or heat pump regularly, you may end up paying for major repairs later on and living in an uncomfortable home while waiting for those repairs. energy usage chart Without regular maintenance an air conditioner loses about 5% of it’s original efficiency each year.  So that 12 SEER unit that you bought just a few years ago could be functioning like a 9 SEER unit today.  The good news is that you can recover most of that lost efficiency through regular maintenance and studies show that with regular maintenance an A/C Unit will maintain up to 95% of it’s original efficiency. Additionally, the cost of that annual maintenance is recovered very quickly in the savings on your monthly electric bill! All Air conditioners and heat pumps require regular maintenance to perform at peak efficiency and we recommend our maintenance service 1 -2 times per year.  Our Maintenance Service is a thorough and extensive inspection of your entire A/C Unit.  A properly cleaned and maintained air conditioning and heating system will help your system perform at peak efficiency and avoid future problems. A dirty system works longer and harder, and costs more to operate than a clean one.  Professional Air Solutions offers a selection of planned maintenance programs for our residential and commercial customers in Clearwater, St. Pete and Largo. We can work with you to create a maintenance program agreement that will help simplify your life and keep your system working at optimal levels. Ideally, maintenance and cleaning should be done in the spring and fall to ensure efficient operation and reduce the chance of system failures during the peak operation seasons.

Rating? A S.E.E.R. (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Rating) is the rating and performance standards that have been developed by the U.S. government and equipment manufacturer’s to produce an energy consumption rating that is easy to understand by consumers. It has a universal formula and conditioning that can be applied to all units and compensates for varying weather conditions. The higher the SEER number, the more energy efficient the product is.
