Oak was unsuccessful so in 1995 Sun changed the name to Java and modified the language to take advantage of the burgeoning World Wide Web. Java is simplified to eliminate language features that cause common programming errors. Java source code files are compiled into a format called bytecode, which can then be executed by a Java interpreter. Compiled Java code can run on most computers because Java interpreters and runtime environments, known as Java Virtual Machines (VMs), exist for most operating systems, including UNIX, the Macintosh OS, and Windows. Bytecode can also be converted directly into machine language instructions by a just-in-time compiler (JIT). Java is a general purpose programming language with a number of features that make the language well suited for use on the World Wide Web. Small Java applications are called Java applets and can be downloaded from any Java-compatible browser.","Data and Analytics, Internet Services, Software",,,10001+,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Vaping is best known for helping thousands reduce or break their nicotine habit. People who have traded traditional cigarettes for e-cigarettes report better health, easier breathing, deeper sleep, and better check-ups at the doctor. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to vaping’s potential. Vaping is an incredible delivery system for tapping into the mood-altering powers of virtually all of Mother Nature’s bounty: plants, roots, leaves, fruits, seeds, barks and more. Now you can choose your mood more effectively than ever. Energy. Relaxation. Mental focus. Sexual arousal. Confidence. Happiness. Peace. It’s all available through the magic of the Mood Vapor Pen. It’s important to understand–vaping isn’t smoking. There’s no flame and nothing is burned. Instead, the Mood Vapor Pen creates a fine vapor, like steam. And what isn’t inhaled dissipates immediately, with no after aroma. A Mood Vapor Pen electronically generates just enough heat–without overheating–to release the essential medicinal and psychoactive compounds you choose. Mood Vaping doesn’t alter the precious ingredients being inhaled. It just delivers them immediately to the brain for the maximum effect…with the minimum cost and effort. Vaping is actually healthier than pills or edible concoctions, because it goes straight to the brain and puts no strain on the digestive system. Plus, since vaping produces virtually no smoke, you inhale little or no tar, ash or other toxic elements. There’s no combustion, no burning, no danger. More and more people are appreciating the importance of natural health. Mood Vaping contributes to health by giving you easy access to natural herbs which have been used for healing throughout history, around the world. The MVP ingredients in their herbal blends are all lab-tested, non toxic, organic and 100% natural.","Food and Beverage, Health Care",,,1-10,1,,650000,USD,650000,650000,USD,650000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Because he had grown up in his family’s retail store, he understood value, quality and customer satisfaction.

Right from the start, he had a well-developed philosophy of what Family Dollar would be and how it would operate, a philosophy from which he and his management team have never strayed. The concept is a simple one, “the customers are the boss, and you need to keep them happy.”   He created a general floorplan that he used in each of his stores that allowed customers to easily shop for their favorite products in any Family Dollar store. With the stores uniformly laid out and stocked, store managers were able to focus on providing good customer service.

After saying that for three times in a row, we realized that we desperately need a word to describe it in the most concise way. So we found it - and we now call our product “Seamless VR”. Simple as that.  What is Seamless VR?  Seamless VR is a gateway for one or several players to fully immerse into virtual reality - as deep as the state-of-the art technology only allows it. You move your body as you would in the real world, see your own body and other players, interact with VR objects, shoot the enemies - and have complete freedom of movement within the physical location. No tethers. No motion sickness. Just the lightweight portable gear - and the regular walls you might want to avoid bumping into. Bottom line: Seamless VR allows you to interact with the virtual world the same way you would interact with the real world.  We operate as a content marketplace for VR content, and our main goal is to make Seamless VR accessible right around the corner, while also ensuring that everyone with a passion for virtual reality gets their experience - as a player, business owner, or content contributor.","Hardware, Media and Entertainment, Software",1,Giorgi Gulabyan,1-10,1,Seed,25000,USD,25000,25000,USD,25000,Ukrainian Startup Fund,1,1,,Private,,,,,,

A pioneer in its industry, Autonomy's unique meaning-based technology is able to make sense of and process unstructured, 'human information,' and draw real business value from that meaning. Human information makes up the vast majority of content in the world today and exists almost everywhere: in documents, emails, pictures, audio, video, and mobile and social media communications. Unlike tagging or keyword solutions, Autonomy uses ground-breaking, pattern-matching technology to form an understanding of this data, allowing computers to capture the meaning held within 100 percent of information, including structured, 'extreme,' or 'big data' amassed in databases from call detail records, gene sequencing, sensors, algorithmic trading, click streams, and other sources. Autonomy software helps businesses and organizations reduce complexity and unlock the real value in data. Autonomy provides meaning-based solutions that understand the full spectrum of enterprise information as well as the relationships that exist within it. By enabling computers to comprehend the 'shades of grey' in our world, rather than only the black and white found in databases, businesses can automate processes, comply with regulations, act in real time, and improve business outcomes. Understanding 100% of Information The characteristic that makes human information unstructured is its form - it does not fit neatly into the rows and columns of a database, but exists in various formats including books, email messages, surveillance video, chat streams, and phone calls that occur across networks, the web, the cloud, and numerous mobile devices. Growing at a rate three times that of structured data, the increasing deluge of unstructured information makes up approximately 90 percent of all information. The challenge for the modern enterprise is to understand and extract value from this rich sea of human information. Today, with Autonomy, organizations can now process and understand in real time, the meaning of 100 percent of information. These advancements signal an historic shift where it is the ""I"" in IT that is changing, rather than the ""T"".","Consumer Electronics, Data and Analytics, Hardware, Other, Software",1,Dr Mike Lynch,10001+,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,7,Private,,,,,,
