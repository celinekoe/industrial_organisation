The ability to spread awareness, engage volunteers, and attract resources is now imperative to our project’s growth. Seeds that Feed now stands face to face with the need for SpareTime.  There are lots of organizations and projects needing help but many face barriers to engagement and lack visibility. SpareTime is an engagement platform for advancing social good that provides organizations with a way to market their projects to the newest generation of volunteers and donors. Additionally, organizations will be able to sponsor project ideas from the community and/or connect and collaborate with organizations with similar social initiatives. Within SpareTime, users can... - browse the local landscape of community projects - create and generate project ideas for the community* - volunteer and connect with projects based on availability and interests - spread awareness about projects and causes through shares and tweets - fund projects sponsored by one or more accredited organizations - track and grow your community influence and economic impact - view and personalize the first ever living history of your community involvement * A portion of our revenue will be used to promote and support youth led project initiatives through SpareTime for Schools. This is the only platform where users can track and personalize a central record of projects they have supported by adding journal entries and photos. Furthermore, all centralized records are validated and reported by accredited organizations and can serve as a reference for secondary education applications and resumes. Lastly, foundations and private donors will have an opportunity to support their communities by funding newly created and sponsored projects. The project based funding approach will provide the most transparent way for donors to see, monitor, and track the direct impact of their charitable contributions. Many hats...

During this time, not only did we find a way to work collaboratively for both of our best interests, but we also laid the foundation of trust that has sustained us since. Our friendship continued to be cultivated because of our common interests, passions, and drive to make a difference.  Beginning again in 2009, our working relationship was rekindled upon the idea of SpareTime and our partnership was formed.
