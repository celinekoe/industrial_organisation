Today, Jackie is a noted photographer and painter in Boston and the surrounding suburbs. As for me, I had not picked up a paintbrush since the third grade. However, upon learning of the ""Paint and Sip""​ concept, I was amazed at the paintings I created with two hours of instruction in a social, fun atmosphere. Over time, I have come to believe that everyone has some artistic talent, but that most of us are discouraged when we are very young and never return to explore this creative side of ourselves.
