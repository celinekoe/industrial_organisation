Per Mr. Dazio, the goal of a product manager is to extend the life of legacy products and assist customers to migrate eventually to newer technologies. Mr. Tsimaras headed hardware development groups at AT&T/Western Electric/Lucent Technologies and Datatek Applications for nearly 30 years. One product on which they both worked was a legacy data networking product called Datakit VCS. It was initially deployed in the mid 1980’s. To this day the telephone companies, both foreign and domestic, still have over one billion dollars of this product in use in their networks. Despite the rise of newer technologies, like IP, LTE, there still is a need to support async, X.25 etc. in the circuit-switched world. Mr. Dazio understood this and helped create a company called Datatek Applications in 1998 simply to continue to enhance and support the Datakit VCS product line. Today that company is still providing support.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Information Technology, Software",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

If you can effectively tell your company or organization’s story across all your channels and with the right people, well, that’s marketing. Unfortunately many companies and organizations don’t have the time, money or expertise to pull it off. That’s where we hope Socialistics can fill the gap. Socialistics is about providing an agency solution that doesn’t feel like an agency solution. We work exclusively with small and medium sized businesses and we do so affordably.
