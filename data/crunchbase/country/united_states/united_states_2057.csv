The program is specifically geared to serve economically, physically, and/or mentally disadvantaged individuals and families. AATPC offers Denver-metro area clients and their families the opportunity to improve their psychological and mental health through strategic therapy sessions with a trained Animal Assisted Therapy Counseling therapist or intern.
