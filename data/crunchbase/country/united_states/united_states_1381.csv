Everyone just says ""Haystack."" I started it in 2002 with David Theo Goldberg and a dozen or so of the top experts in all the fields named in that long acronym. We came together because we believe that the Information Age is way too complicated for any one field, any one discipline, any one area of life. The historian Robert Darnton likes to say that, in all human history, there have only been four great Information Ages. The first came in 4000 BC, in ancient Mesopotamia, with the invention of writing. The second came in 10th century China and then later in 15th century Europe with Gutenberg and the invention of moveable type. The third came around the time of the American Revolution (this was my original field of expertise, by the way) with steam-powered presses, machine-made ink and machine made paper. For the first time in human history, books were cheap enough that ordinary people could afford to buy them. Circulating libraries were invented and that meant even the poor could read. Mostly they read popular novels, the ""video game of the 18th century."" (Some of the Founding Fathers were sure books would distract youth, lead to violence and promiscuity, render them unfit for gainful employment—all those bad things now blamed on video games). Literacy and all kinds of literary forms, including newspapers, changed in the third Information Age just as they are changing in humanity's Fourth Great Information Age, our own era, where the Internet and the World Wide Web have made the transformations faster and more global than anyone (including its inventors) every dreamed possible. HASTAC is dedicated to rethinking learning, in and out of school, for our own Information Age. It's free, voluntary, a network of networks, that has grown from an idea to a movement—about 5000 individual members, including almost 200 graduate and undergraduate students (HASTAC Scholars) nominated and supported with scholarships from over 75 institutions. Warning: it's mostly academics, ""hacktivists,"" and geeks of all types. If that describes you, join us at www.hastac.org.

We provide powerful analytics to our global client base of LPs, GPs, data providers, and investor advisers. By combining in-depth industry experience with data science, quantitative, and fundamental investment analysis expertise our team enhances our customers' decision-making, investor relations, asset allocation, fund manager selection and business development. Our products and services cover different asset classes like private equity, venture capital, hedge funds, real estate, and infrastructure and enable clients to perform detailed analysis of their investments and make efficient decisions about their holdings.  With the growing allocation to private equity it is critical to reliably project PE cash flows and value. However, this is challenging due to the structure and illiquidity of the asset class, the scarcity of public information, and the high degree of uncertainty about the size and timing of the related cash flows. Moreover, the shift in global trends that led to an increasing importance placed on fair value requires a fundamental change in the valuation approaches to private equity. However, fair value is based on judgement and thus often leads to biases and to minimize this problem, valuation must be performed by independent professionals using industry best practices. We offer proprietary models for forecasting and valuation of PE cash flows, price, and risk.  Our cash flow model BOSTON (Bow-Speed Time-Option Normalized) offers a robust approach that addresses the needs of the vast majority of PE investors and incorporates volatility to give a more informed performance picture, reflecting the inherent uncertainty of investment cash flows.  Main features:  1. Founded on sound economic principles and broad empirical support. 2. Combines the intuition of the Yale model with our own research insights resulting in a robust approach that addresses the vast majority of investors in private equity partnerships.    3. Incorporates the volatility of the underlying investments using best-of-breed third party risk models to give a more informed investment performance picture, reflecting the inherent uncertainty of investment cash flows.   4. Provides LPs with a measure of the magnitude of potential cash flow shortage in relation to their future liabilities (redemptions, pension outlays, capital expenditure, future unfunded commitments, etc.)    5. Allows GPs to predict the amount and variation of future distributions  to optimize the capital call schedules and deal flow, as well as plan the capital resources of their firm in the most efficient way over time.  6. A key component of our risk-aware valuation model EXPLO. Our valuation model EXPLO (Expected Profit Loss) allows LPs  to monitor their investments, screen new opportunities, and develop/adjust their portfolio strategies. Main features:  1. Independent valuation, not derived from GP appraisals.  2. Available at each point in time and thus suitable as a comparable methodology for bench-marking across periods and funds.  3. Compliant with IPEV and AICPA guidelines. 4. Risk aware methodology.  5. Based on the most advanced research in the industry that does not compromise granularity, attention to detail, methodology rigor, and integrity of the valuation process.  6. Applicable to traditional private equity deals and funds, as well as hybrid structures that incorporate embedded options and contingencies.","Data and Analytics, Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Other, Real Estate, Software",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Friends, family, coworkers, and colleagues can start and compete in their own weight loss competitions. Members start or join weight loss competitions that have already been started. These weight loss challenges can be public or private challenges. They can also invite their friends and coworkers from across different social networks like Facebook and compete to be the biggest loser of their competition. Weight loss competitions are not a new idea per se. Companies, friend groups, and families have been organizing their own weight loss challenges via email lists, forums, excel spreadsheets, and on paper for years and years. But these methods leave participants with a ton of work to do by way of calculating weight loss percentages and gathering data which can be difficult to interpret and keep straight. Weight Loss Wars allows its members to input their weight loss progress on a personal online diary for weight loss. They simply click to update stats and its done. This personal information is then fed into the members private and/or public weight loss challenges, and is updated against their teamsâ€™ or individual scores in real-time. Weight loss challenge pages also include a wall to post trash talk, questions, encouragement and other comments just like a â€œwallâ€ you would find on a Facebook page. These provide easy to use weight progress graphs, a support network of other members (which can be your own friends and family whom you invite) who can motivate each other to reach their weight loss, fitness, or ideal body weight maintenance goals. Weightlosswars also incorporates a layer of game mechanics where you can request other members to be motivators to help you check in consistently, win weight loss competitions, reach goals, and more. Weight loss wars is run by a trust of Pete Maughanâ€™s and is the original, premium, and #1 weight loss competition site on the internet. Founded in January 2004, before the Biggest Loser arrived on the television scene, Weight Loss Wars provides encouragement, fun, and effective weight loss results to thousands. Over 100,000 members strong and over 1.2 million pounds down, there is a good start and much more weight to be lost in the future. Weightlosswars thanks its many members and looks forward to helping others to reach their body weight goals.
