The firm excels by solely practicing real estate law and only taking on projects and cases where it is among the best in the field.  Adam Leitman Bailey, P.C. has achieved groundbreaking results in the courtroom, in the board room, at the closing table, in the lobbies of legislative bodies, and in every other venue where talented legal advocacy is key to its clients’ interests. Adam Leitman Bailey, P.C. has participated and prevailed in many of the most important New York real estate cases of the new millennium, as reflected in numerous published and unpublished decisions on novel legal issues.  Some of these notable victories have changed the landscape of New York Law.  The firm has invented new ways to practice law and new theories to solve its clients’ problems. Its successes have resulted in producing new laws and new precedents, creating new leases to become the industry standards, devising new faster, less expensive procedures to obtain foreclosures and evictions, using “Perry Mason” moments to win trials, creating out-of- the-box ways to collect on judgments, and creating new theories of law to obtain justice for clients. Adam Leitman Bailey, P.C. counts itself among only one of two law firms with under 30 attorneys to achieve an AV Martindale-Hubbell rating, repeated Super Lawyers ranking, selection into the Bar Registry of Preeminent Lawyers, and a Chambers & Partners award for being one of the “Leading Lawyers for Real Estate.” Chambers & Partners named Adam Leitman Bailey as a “tenacious and confident litigator who is quick-witted in court and respected by the judges” noting that he is “an extraordinary practitioner who gets great results” and quoting a client on his “ability to anticipate things before they happen.”  “Hired to litigate extremely high-profile cases, Adam Leitman Bailey has impressed sources with his courtroom presence.” Another client told Chambers, “You feel like you have a zealous advocate out there working for you, and you never worry about things when they are in his hands.” A New York State Judge wrote that Adam Leitman Bailey “was the best trial lawyer I saw in my nine years as a Judge in New York City.”  When Mr. Bailey’s firm used a forgotten statute to prevail in a landmark case, the Wall Street Journal quoted a prominent New York developer’s attorney who called the holding a “game changer” affecting real estate nationwide.",Real Estate,1,Adam Leitman Bailey,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Providing equitable care: The app can help ensure that all patients and families have access to high-quality child life services, regardless of their location or socioeconomic status. CLOC can help provide more equitable care and reduce disparities in care. 3. Ensuring patient privacy: The HIPAA-compliant Child Life On Call app was developed with these principles in mind to ensure that patient data is handled responsibly and ethically. 4.

Opened on August 4, 1996, The Soho Grand is located in the heart of SoHo, alongside world renowned art galleries, boutiques and restaurants. Undeterred that downtown’s SoHo district had been devoid of hotels for over a century, owners Leonard and Emanuel Stern, of Hartz Mountain Industries, developed their pioneering vision in, what is now, the city’s most sought after neighborhood. The result quickly became one of the world’s most celebrated boutique hotels and Soho Grand continues to be an integral part of the neighborhood’s fabric, home to savvy locals and sophisticated travelers alike. The Soho Grand’s unfailing ability to balance service and style has been the key to its success and continuously sets the highest standard amongst hotels of its kind. The hotel continues to receive accolades from both national and international publications; from Conde Nast Traveler’s coveted ‘Gold List’ as one of the world’s best places to stay and being voted one of the top 100 places to stay worldwide. New York magazine cited the Soho Grand as the “top boutique hotel without attitude.” Interior designer Nate Berkus, nationally featured Soho Grand as one of his favorite places to stay on Oprah’s ‘Best Of’ show.  Parallel to its innovative vision is the Soho Grand’s leadership in design; Helpern Architects constructed the hotel’s intentionally nondescript exterior and is a reflection of the evolution of SoHo’s architectural heritage over the past 125 years. Celebrated interior designer Bill Sofield, of Studio Sofield, has collaborated with the hotel from its inception and the interior mirrors the stylistic trends visible in the neighborhood today. All of the materials used in construction are consistent with the existing character of the community and continues to elevate and embody the classic SoHo aesthetic. With the recent introduction of the Club Room, and new custom suites on the 16th floor, the Soho Grand succeeds in updating its offerings in a way that exudes luxury yet stays true to the hotel’s core aesthetic. Soho Grand has 353 custom hotel rooms and Suites and 2 sprawling Penthouse Lofts that reflect the history and character of the neighborhood. The Hotel stands 17-stories offering stunning views of downtown Manhattan. The beautifully designed guestrooms and suites feature custom furnishings and high end fixtures, Egyptian cotton linen, Frette bathrobes. Bath amenities are from New York’s original apothecary, Kiehl’s Since 1851. Having been the first hotel to use their renowned products, the Soho Grand is proud to revisit the heritage brand this fall. Each room is equipped with flat-screen plasma televisions and iPod dock and speakers. Original artwork is provided by the Howard Greenberg Gallery. Suites are equipped with 21-inch iMacs and an iPad pre-loaded with the Hotel’s carefully curated downtown Neighborhood Guide.",Travel and Tourism,,,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
