Him, with over twenty years in the Recreational Vehicle industry and me with administrative and management experience, founded a mobile RV repair business. We decided to call the company J & S RV Service and Repair. We soon began marketing our new business online and in local publications. Within the first month we had a steady stream of clients, and that continued through the Summer of 2009. Need to Branch Out Around August we realized that most of our work will come between Spring and early Fall. At that point, I decided to expand the business and started advertising Recreational Vehicles on our company's website. Soon there was enough demand for our goods that a new company was established, branching off from our main company. The new company was called Miller Online Market. This, we believed would supplement the main part of the business during the colder months. As our success in product sales, again, continued to improve, we decided to dedicate more time to this part of the business. Much of our decision to focus more on the online part of the business was do to the decline in the mobile RV repair part of the business. End of Mobile Repair By early 2011, we decided to cease doing mobile repairs, and switch to the product sales full time. By then, in addition to selling RV products, we were also selling boating products and outdoor products.  At its height, Miller Online Market sold everything from Recreational Vehicle and boating products to outdoor and consumer electonics. In early 2013, the company's name changed again, this time to its current state -- Miller Knives, Inc. Currently Today, Miller Knives is an online retailer of knives, multi-purpose tools, and other related accessories. Our current website has been open since April 2014. Already, we have seen success in the short time we have been here. I am no longer in the RV business but I still have industry connections and access to RV parts. If you are interested in this, give me a call or send a message with ""RV"" as your subject.   If you ever have any questions or comments relating the business, itself, the products we sell, or any things else related the Miller Knives, we want to hear from you.","Commerce and Shopping, Internet Services, Sales and Marketing",1,Steven Miller,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Back in 1982, veteran photographer Bob Horsch opened up his first gallery in a small Chicago neighborhood. His business began to grow as locals visited the retial store to purchase fine art photographs as gifts or to decorate their homes and offices. To accomadate demand, the gallery was relocated to famous Michigan Avenue in 1991. It was open 7 days a week, 12 hours a day. After nearly 20 years in the retial business, the store closed in early 2008. Bob then took his business online with help from his son, Jeff, and created Horschgallery.com. Jeff was shocked that photographs were being sold to people all around the country. It was then that he wanted to help other talented cityscape and landscape photographers like his father sell more quality photos online. After years of throwing around ideas, he quit his job at age 31 to learn how to build the website he had envisioned. Eight months later, a new e-commerce photography business was born.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
