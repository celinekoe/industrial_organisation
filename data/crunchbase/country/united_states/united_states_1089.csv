It enables adaptive control for Microgrid, matching and tuning heterogeneous energy sources (grid, distributed generation such as Solar/Wind, CHP/NG, Diesel generation), energy consumers (curtailable or non-curtailable load), energy storages (batteries), bi-directional EV charging stations and others to achieve reliable, cost-efficient operation of the Microgrid.  2. Application in EV Charging. This software provides intelligent control of EV charging facilities with more than one EV charger in place, in order to minimize load demand and impact to the power grid, while maximizing EV charging capacity and economics. It works for facilities with EV chargers, onsite energy storage, and onsite power generation. The incremental demand peak and associated cost incurred for demand based on EV fleet size with this solution is many times less than the plain vanilla EV charging facilities. 3. Application in Buildings and Health Care Facilities. This software allows building and health care facility managers and operators to not only obtain real time data on energy consumption but also adjust facility behavior based on that data. It brings artificial intelligence to facility management and has self-learning capability that adapts to the facility behavior as it goes along. It provides holistic integration of real-time data from heterogeneous sub-systems, intelligent forecasting and optimization to aid building operation decisions, autonomic capability to actuate building sub-systems such as VFDs through common protocol (such as BACnet or Modbus) as an autopilot, to achieve energy-efficient intelligent building.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Consumer Electronics, Data and Analytics, Energy, Hardware, Information Technology, Natural Resources, Science and Engineering, Software, Sustainability",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
