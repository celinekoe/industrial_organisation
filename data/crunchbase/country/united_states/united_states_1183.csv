The new company, Novan Solar, Inc., while completely unrelated to US Filter, has brought together several of the original founding members of Novan Energy, Inc. and others with backgrounds in corporate development and management of public companies. The new company, Novan Solar Inc., has acquired the flat-plate division of Industrial Solar Technology of Golden, which is solar thermal company in Colorado. Novan Solar will offer design, engineering, consultation and installation services for any size of project, whether for residential or commercial applications. Novan systems are operating in Colorado, California, Arizona and Texas, and in countries overseas and is a leader in the design and installation of large-scale flat plate collector systems for commercial applications. Recent applications include the North Boulder Recreation Center and two Veterans’ Administration Hospitals in Texas. Those systems are the largest flat plate solar systems to be installed in the US in over 20 years. Novan also serves the needs of residential customers throughout Colorado for renewable energy systems. Our in-house engineering and installation staff provides a single source capability for solar systems to provide thermal and electrical energy. They build standard and custom hot water storage tanks in sizes from 80 to more than 10,000 gallons and this together with the pre-fabrication of many system components in their manufacturing facility helps to control costs. They install flat plate solar collectors to heat hot water, spas, and swimming pools and to provide space heat. Radiant floor heating systems are gaining in popularity. Using solar energy to heat radiant floors combines high efficiency and comfort without the emissions of conventional fuels. Besides new installations, Novan services all brands of existing solar systems and has the technical resources to tackle the most complex systems. They use collectors manufactured by SunEarth for their flat plate thermal applications. Novan is the distributor in the Colorado region for these highly efficient, SRCC-certified collectors. They stock common collector sizes for immediate delivery at competitive prices. They also stock a full range of system components, including pumps, controllers, propylene glycol, insulation, etc. for retail purchase. For those customers in off-grid homes, or seeking to reduce dependence on electricity providers, Novan designs, installs and services solar electric photovoltaic power (PV) systems.","Energy, Natural Resources, Sustainability",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
