The modern day curtain walls use glass as an exterior facade and offer an advantage of rapid on-site assembly, which significantly reduces construction cost. Besides looking exquisite, glass curtain walls offer protection against wind, water, and other environmental forces that may otherwise spoil the decor of the building. Glass work engineers at Northern Glass are experienced in restricting light in varying proportions and adding colors to the neutral appearance glass products while retaining their natural look.
