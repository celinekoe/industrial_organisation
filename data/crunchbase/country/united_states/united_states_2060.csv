We are dedicated to providing a vibrant community for coffee-lovers, new and old alike. Our mission is to make it easy for you to discover and enjoy the perfect cup of coffee.  We use the latest technology to provide unparalleled ease-of-selection and prevent customers from feeling overwhelmed by the enormous selection on the site.  Custom search results are automatically ranked by ratings provided by other coffee-lovers just like you, and the reviews from fellow coffee aficionados provide an additional layer of feedback, helping customers find coffee they’re most likely to enjoy.  We also offer coffee-enthusiasts a way to read smart and insightful content from coffee experts, with our deep archive of original articles, exclusive-to-the-web book excerpts, and intelligent blog posts that not only entertain, but also connect customers to coffees they’re likely to enjoy.  We invite you to join our vibrant community by creating a profile here to start contributing your reviews or connecting with other members via private messages. Coffee purchased on ROASTe is shipped fresh from the roaster directly to our customers’ doors.  The search is over for the place to find a better cup of coffee. The Concept The recent explosion of gourmet coffee consumption among upscale American households ($5B/yr), alongside the remarkable cost reduction in roasting equipment, has boosted the number of coffee roasters in the U.S. dramatically. Naturally tens of new coffee websites were launched by roasters in the past couple of years, yet there is no central destination for coffee shopping on the web. Our goal is to remedy that with ROASTe.  We concluded that the emergence of thousands of specialty coffee roasters in the U.S. and the general trend of at-home gourmet coffee provide a profitable opportunity to create a central destination for coffee shoppers on the Internet.  ROASTe has developed an advanced social marketplace platform that helps consumer discover new roasts they can enjoy. It utilizes our innovative business model that allows us to offer thousands of coffee products --with an engine that generates personalized peer-recommendations, based on the shopper's unique coffee preferences. In short, we provide the ultimate source for gourmet coffee.","Commerce and Shopping, Food and Beverage, Internet Services",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
