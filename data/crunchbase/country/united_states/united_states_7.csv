This is a product that anyone - friends, colleagues, family - can use knowing that after one hour the Beam is over and the sharing stops. Initiating a Beam with a contact takes just two taps. It's as easy as making a phone call. And, like a phone call, the other party must accept before sharing begins. At Beam, our goal is to build a user-focused brand that understands both the consumer and technical needs for sharing locations. The Beam vision is to bring maps to life.
