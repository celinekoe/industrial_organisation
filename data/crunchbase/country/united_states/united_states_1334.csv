Its activities range from magazine publishing and campaigning on ethical issues to holding conferences and supporting a network of autonomous local groups. Secular humanists reject supernatural and authoritarian beliefs. They affirm that we must take responsibility for our own lives and the communities and world in which we live. Secular humanism emphasizes reason and scientific inquiry, individual freedom and responsibility, human values and compassion, and the need for tolerance and cooperation. Council Activities Include: Championing the Rights and Beliefs of Secular Humanists The Council campaigns for a more secular and ethical society. It presents the case for understanding the world without reference to a god, works to separate church and state, and defends the rights of those who reject religious beliefs. Developing Secular Communities The Council for Secular Humanism supports independent, autonomous local groups that provide a forum for sharing ideas and a base for social activities. Regular regional and national conferences bring secular humanists together to exchange ideas and explore topical issues. Realizing Secular Values in Everyday Life The Council promotes rational, human-based viewpoints on important social and ethical issues. In particular, it tackles issues where traditional religion obstructs the right to self-determination, for example, freedom of choice in sexual relationships, reproduction, and voluntary euthanasia.","Biotechnology, Community and Lifestyle, Other, Science and Engineering",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

As fiduciaries, we have voluntarily accepted the greater responsibility of always putting our clientsâ interests ahead of our own, to minimize and disclose any potential conflicts of interest, and to ensure our advice is accurate, thorough, and transparent.","Community and Lifestyle, Financial Services, Other",,,11-50,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
