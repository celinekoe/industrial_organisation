It offers various features to overcome the common challenges faced by businesses including; disorganized work, lack of focus, miscommunication, uncertain team morale, and inadequate planning. With AI power, it plans your day for you. We believe that to achieve success as a team, it's important for each individual to effectively plan their day and adhere to the plan. During the planning stage, 3 main questions need to be answered: “what do I need to work on?”, “how long will it take?” and, “how much time do I have?”.  Planning is important, but not enough by itself for success. Individuals need to maintain their focus throughout the execution of the plan. For ultimate focus, it is essential to minimize the distractions caused by unnecessary messages, switching between unfinished tasks, and losing track of time. With BeforeSunset’s workspace, you can plan your day by reviewing yesterday’s achievements, and unfinished tasks. You can stay on schedule throughout the day by keeping track of time for each task and focusing on one task at a time.  By tracking the time spent on each task, you can ensure that work is progressing as planned and make adjustments as needed. With analytics provided by BeforeSunset close your day by reviewing and reflecting on the progress you made. This detailed daily and weekly analysis can help you identify areas for improvement and plan your future work accordingly. Since work is not all we have, it is important to include personal planning in your day to make sure your daily plan is accurate. This doesn’t mean all your teammates see your personal todos on BeforeSunset. Our tool has the capability to make todos private if the user chooses. BeforeSunset's ""Team Timeline"" feature is designed for team members to share updates with the team such as; the task they're currently working on, their availability, meeting status, daily mood, whether they're working remotely or on-site, and who is currently working or taking time off. This helps keep everyone on the same page, prevent miscommunication, and minimize the need for additional communication. To sustain and improve productivity, reflection is provided by BeforeSunset’s analytics. These reports include information such as completed vs. unfinished tasks, meeting analytics, mood analytics, and how much effort the team spent on each tag.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Science and Engineering, Software",3,"Batuhan Ulasan, Ceylan Ersoy, Elif Duran",11-50,2,Seed,325000,USD,325000,325000,USD,325000,LAUNCH,,1,,Private,,,,,,

Its first commercial application will be as a more reliable means of vascular access for dialysis patients, with a subsequent application to treat peripheral artery disease.  We have great results in multiple controlled animal studies, a large patent portfolio, established production capacity, and are ready to begin human studies later this year in preparation for market launch. Near-Term Problem / Market Opportunity:  Vascular Access for Dialysis Kidney failure patients need to have their blood filtered 3 times per week via dialysis.  This removes waste from the blood, which would otherwise cause them to die.  However, current methods for repeatedly accessing the bloodstream for dialysis are unreliable.  This problem is a huge contributor to the $50 billion per year that the U.S. spends on dialysis patients (7% of Medicare’s entire budget!).  A vascular graft is often implanted under the skin (connecting an artery to a vein) to create an access site with sufficient bloodflow for dialysis -- but existing grafts tend to occlude quickly, requiring repeated expensive interventions to keep them open. Solution:  STARgraft Because our vascular graft remains open to blood flow much longer than existing grafts, it can potentially satisfy a severe unmet clinical need for ready-to-use, safe, long-term dialysis access, while substantially reducing costs, illness and death rate among dialysis patients. Product Pipeline We have additional products in development, including an implantable port which will allow needle-free dialysis.  Eliminating the use of needles would further reduce cost and illness among dialysis patients, and allow them to perform dialysis in the convenience of their own home.  In addition, our platform STAR biomaterial can improve the performance of a wide range of implantable devices via its remarkable ability to prevent both infection and scar tissue.  We currently have two corporate-funded development contracts to explore STAR material’s use in multiple other device applications.

It is a frictionless, non-invasive, early detection, remote disease progression monitoring, and therapeutic measurement modality. nQ uses an artificial intelligence company to develop computational biomarkers that have been proven in five years of clinical trials to substantially change the way disease is managed for a wide range of neuromotor and neurocognitive disorders (Alzhemer's, Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis, ALS, concussion, et al. The platfomr focuses on analysis of user interaction with common electronic devices to capture functional decline related to neurodegenerative disorders. The fine control of typing and touch screen kinematics together with the frequent use of electronic devices allows for precise monitoring of small changes in neurodegeneration that frequently go unnoticed by clinicians. nQ allows for early detection of disease, 24/7, passive, at home, remote monitoring of disease progression and the measurement of impact of therapy at a fraction of the cost of current gold standards. There is no required task. Just use your device as your would normally use it. Of note, as one of the company's medical advisors, Zoltan Mari, MD, of the Cleveland Clinic, so aptly quoted: ""As important as it is to fund novel compounds for treating diseases, it is also important to set the stage for maximum impact when those compounds are discovered and approved for use. It is impossible to find a cure without early detection. That's why drug candidates fail. When the FDA puts its stamp on the first disease modifying drugs, such early detection technologies will be instantly necessary."" He goes on to state further: ""We also need a disease progression marker. Nothing so far has managed to do very well (while being profoundly expensive). Much of our research and clinical interest is turning toward disease progression. All efforts should focus on readying and perfecting early detection tools and building effective, reliable, inexpensive ways of tracking disease and the impact of therapy over time.” nQ is that early detection, disease progression computational biomarker.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",2,"Mark Pascarella, Richie Bavasso",11-50,5,Seed,4450000,USD,4450000,4450000,USD,4450000,"XLerateHealth, DigiTx Partners, PharmStars, GSK NEXT, Bob Saunders",3,5,,Private,,,,,,

Unlike most screening techniques, which rely on anatomical imaging, Seno's goal is to bring functional imaging that can detect angiogenesis to the marketplace. Their first product is a small animal imaging device. This product application was successfully licensed to a world market leader, VisualSonics. Products for use with humans, focusing initially on breast cancer, are also in development. Seno’s first clinical application is for breast cancer diagnosis. A strong, experienced management team and nationally recognized Scientific Advisory Board have been assembled to complete the commercialization, secure regulatory approval and launch the products. The management team has a long history of working together and in successfully commercializing medical devices. Seno’s patented technology integrates the use of lasers and acoustics to determine the presence of angiogenesis—the growth of blood vessels and higher blood volume that always surrounds a tumor. This represents a significant evolutionary step in imaging. Unlike anatomical imaging techniques, such as mammography, laser opto-acoustic imaging can detect breast cancer, for example, at its earliest clinically significant stage (2 mm. versus 10 mm. with mammography) without patient discomfort or exposure to harmful x-ray. The opportunities are exciting…for investors and scientists, for physicians and the myriad women and men tested for or diagnosed with cancer each year. The goal of laser opto-acoustic imaging is to allow more precise and earlier detection of smaller tumors and the ability to differentiate benign from malignant growth without biopsy. Future applications will focus on other types of cancer and broader diagnostic and treatment applications. Seno acquired working pre-prototypes in addition to the core patents on opto-acoustic technology; they will license two other patents for future applications. These patents constitute a platform technology with a multitude of potential follow-on applications, including imaging for the earliest detection of cancer of the ovary, bladder, prostate, colon and melanoma as well as unstable plaque (cardiovascular). Peer review and the continued funding of $13 million from nationally recognized institutions such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the Department of Defense (DoD) support their scientific credibility. And, significantly, the pre-prototypes being used in clinical testing have demonstrated a strong correlation to biopsy in diagnosing cancer. They look forward to the future and to the role Seno can play in minimizing the uncertainty, the cost and trauma of diagnosing and treating cancer.",Health Care,1,Janet Campbell,51-100,6,Late Stage Venture,57332281,USD,57332281,60732281,USD,60732281,MedCare Investment Funds,1,1,,Private,,,,,,
