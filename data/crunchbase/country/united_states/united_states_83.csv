Lighticians,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lighticians,Sensor,"Brooklyn, New York, United States",Lighticians is a motion picture lighting with an instinctual lighting control app and robust plug-and-play wireless platform.,"1,401,453","Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",Less than $1M,Active,2014-04-14,day,,,,,For Profit,http://www.lighticians.com,"Dynamic lighting is crucial to visual storytelling. The pace of content creation is faster than ever and exceeds the resources available to productions; placing pressure on Gaffers and other lighting creatives to do more with less. Lighticians Inc. empowers the motion picture lighting industry with embedded intelligent software and wireless control that enables efficient and exquisite lighting. They enhance the capabilities of any light and concentrate that power to the hand of the designer. There is an accelerating paradigm shift sweeping through the lighting industry. As LED and other solid state light sources replace legacy incandescent and arc technology, the dimming and color mixing devices are being removed from the dimmer rooms and integrated into the lights themselves. The conventional topology of dense dimmer rooms and large control consoles is no longer sufficient. Simultaneously, productions are moving away from the big studio model towards more efficient projects. Their app and network fits in the middle of these two shifts and drives their adoption by their customers. Plug-and-play control fits into the palm of the lighting technician’s hand. The Juice Tap™ instantly transforms any DMX device into a wirelessly controlled light directly from the app. Instead of using a proprietary wireless technology, Lighticians leveraged high performance WiFi radios and standards based routing protocols. This enables all their products to work well with mobile devices, IoT platforms, and all the laptops, sensors, computers, routers, etc. that the WiFi ecosystem already includes. They built on this with a proprietary and very smart software stack that integrates everything needed to establish the network, provision each device, and transmit or receive various forms of DMX over IP, such as sACN E1.31 in their launch case.   But when using their app and network together, any connected device is provisioned quickly and easily directly within the app, patching is as easy as creating events in a calendar, and control is a fast as scratching notes in a notepad. The Juicer App™ features direct control of lights with the shortest path from launch to lights on in the industry, a mobile app focused design free from skeuomorphism, deep integration with their hardware (other industry standards based platforms also are compatible), and a growth path into sophisticated control without over complicating the simple basics. Each step is available to purchase as a module, so the initial cost is low, with the potential to scale up as the customer requires. There is no need to purchase a giant system when only 5% of it is actually required. Purchase as your needs grow. This system is truly plug-and-play from the first small living room of practicals all the way to a giant night exterior.",Hardware,3,"Michael McDonald, Richard Ulivella, Timothy Duff",1-10,1,,,,,,USD,,ACRE,,1,,Private,,,,,,

We connect brands with modeling agencies that are using D’Marie to determine the value of their model’s social media portfolio. We’ve built a custom algorithm recognized by many brands, agencies and influencers in the fashion industry as the standard for determining the dollar value of a model’s post to Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. Our system measures over 45 unique metrics within a model’s social media portfolio. Our curated network of “influencers” includes models, musicians, actors, bloggers, make-up artists, hair stylists and other talent with social media portfolios valued by brands. D’Marie’s system assists with the distribution of social content as well as the reporting of each social post’s success in generating reach, engagement and sales. Our subscribers use an image-publishing tool that enables them to publish what we call a “fashion credit” (i.e. images embedded with clothing and cosmetic product URL links).  These credits can be exported to Facebook, Twitter (and soon Instagram) as well as embedded on e-commerce websites and personal blogs. The credits generate in-depth granular data about reach, engagement and ultimately sales conversions per post, per platform.","Clothing and Apparel, Commerce and Shopping, Community and Lifestyle, Data and Analytics, Design, Internet Services",1,Frank Spadafora,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
