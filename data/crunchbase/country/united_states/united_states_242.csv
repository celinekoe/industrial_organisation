Functionality takes off with a collection of pages revolving around a single event to capture the experience.  Users can check out the artists, post comments, see who is attending, get venue information, post pictures, purchase tickets, and listen to music.  By linking these items to a single event we can create a sense of a 'local community' around concerts. Imagine capturing the concert from the viewpoint of the fans at a single show then tracking that around the country and throughout the years.  preAmped currently has over 350k artists, tracking 250k events from all over the net. A complex system has been designed to merge and clean web data to give the user a simple presentation.  Every venue has an address that has been standardized, geocoded, and validated via external systems.  Users can go directly to their favorite artist or check out their city no matter the size.   The site is also on top of the latest trends and technologies.  Every event, city, and venue page is geo coded, RSS feeds for each city, URLs  are rewritten, and the team continues to explore vCard tagging and KML exports.  preAmped is a new and growing site with an API to be released soon with the sole purpose of removing the overhead of data processing and spawning amazing new tools, widgets, mobile apps, and websites.","Events, Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio",2,"Jerome Schulist, Ryan Mckenzie",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

UPR utilizes a thorough confidentiality agreement and non-disclosure agreement in order to safeguard the unique ideas of its clients until adequate patenting, and trademarking can cover the product. Understanding that some people need a little extra help coming up with the perfect invention and bringing it to market, United Patent Research supplies prospective clients with a two-page Nine Simple Invention Criteria & Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) document in its free introductory inventorâs kit. These nine steps are designed to help aspiring inventors dream up a product idea that will ultimately prove profitable. The experienced professionals at United Patent Research believe that the first step should be to cultivate an attitude of critical objectiveness when it comes to a project. Many people become deeply emotionally invested in their ideas, and this attachment can cause them to make unwise decisions during the development process. UPRâs technical team can assist a client with this step by offering impartial advice and feedback early in the development of the product. The second important step in United Patent Researchâs guide to successful invention development involves detailed marketing planning. In order to achieve long-term profitability, inventors must carefully think through the ways in which their products will appeal to consumers and consider with which existing products they may have to compete. UPR staffs professionals who can guide clients through this process.

More rigorous study followed and eventually, certification. Coming to the United States in the mid 1960s in hopes to perform acupuncture in Los Angeles, Yu was unable to get licensed since acupuncture was largely unheard of at the time. Undeterred, Yu quickly brought healing to the people in his community by setting up a makeshift office in Chinatown where people would patiently wait on the stairs, knowing that Dr. Yu would soon be providing relief for their various ailments. Dr. Yu's office was one of the few to offer fertility acupuncture in Los Angeles. Dr. Yu was instrumental in drafting a bill to make licensing possible in California. After much resistance from the American Medical Association and then-Governor Ronald Reagan, the bill was finally passed in 1976 by Reagan’s successor – and a firm believer in acupuncture – Jerry Brown. Dr. Yu became a licensed acupuncturist in 1976. Dr. Mei Mei Yu interned at the Yu Clinic in Taiwan from 1965 until she moved to Los Angeles with her husband in 1972. She received her license in early 1977.

Cheap Car Leasing NYC,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cheap-car-leasing-nyc,E-Commerce,"New York, New York, United States",Cheap Car Leasing NYC,"3,137,365","Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",,Active,2001-02-19,day,,,,,For Profit,http://cheapcarleasingnyc.com,"Hours: Mon - Thur 9 a.m – 9 p.m,  Fri  9 a.m – 7 p.m,  Sat 9 a.m – 9 p.m,  Sun 10 a.m – 7 p.m  Payment Methods: Cash, all cc, checks. Description: Let’s make this super-easy and just “cut to the chase”: The 5 top reasons to lease with us are: 1) We have the cheapest prices around, bar none; 2) We have a truly incredible inventory of vehicles for you to choose from, not just a small selection from a few manufacturers; 3) When you lease with us, you’ll have a super-smooth, incredibly convenient leasing experience. 4) We can get you really great financing deals. 5) You’ll love and appreciate our customer service. “Should I lease or should I buy” is a question lots of people in need of transportation ask themselves. Thankfully, the answer is easy: lease.  There are lots of reasons why leasing beats buying, and here are just a few of them. First, when you lease, you always have the option to swap out your present lease for a different one. In other words, you can always be driving a vehicle that perfectly fits your present needs. When you buy, that’s not the case. As an example, let’s say you’re a weekend warrior musician, in a band, and buy a van so you can haul your gear around. Then, you have a falling out with your drummer, the band breaks up, and you find yourself no longer wanting to go through the work of dealing with those Friday and Saturday night gigs. But now you’re stuck with a huge van, a vehicle meant to haul things, while you have nothing to haul. The van you bought guzzles gas like crazy, too, and you just feel as if you have “too much vehicle” for your needs. To get rid of it and get into something new, you have to sell it, and what you’d get for it is nothing close to what you paid for it – even if it’s only a few months old! The second you drove it off the lot, it depreciated in value by thousands of dollars. And, of course, you have to deal with potential buyers, the dangers of doing business with strangers via things like Craig’s list, having to arrange meetings, etc. In other words, it’s a huge pain. When you lease, though, you can return that van and get into something more suitable for your changed needs – or even just your changed tastes. Plus, you won’t have to miss out on all of the new technology or, more importantly, the latest in safety features that keep your body and soul together.  Yes, leasing is definitely a better idea! But now comes the question, “Where should I lease from?” Well, if you live in or near New York City, why not lease from the leasing agency that has the cheapest prices around, a generous inventory of vehicles for you to choose from, an super-convenient leasing  experience, great financing deals, and customer service you’ll love?

Dave watched in shocked as thousands of people posted pictures of missing loved ones throughout the city. He realized that there needed to be a faster, more efficient way to connect people in need with those looking to help. That was the moment in which the idea for Wish Upon A Hero was born. Less than five years later, Hurricane Katrina created a similar catastrophic event in New Orleans where hundreds of thousands of people needed immediate help. This time it wasn't just about locating loved ones. Hurricane victims needed everything from healthcare services, food, fresh water, clothing and shelter. As Dave watched thousands of everyday heroes coming to the aide of hurricane victims, it became clear that a community-based helping program needed to be created to help organized the efforts of people wanting to help. The Wish Upon A Hero - Hero Club Program was created to engage students in philanthropy while making a direct impact in the lives of people in their local community. Students have the time and passion to help, they also have the support of their family, friends and local businesses. By empowering the younger generation with the tools to help, we are able to create a network of helping communities across the country. The mission of Wish Upon A Hero is to set up Hero Clubs at every school to empower the students to raise money and awareness for causes in their community.
