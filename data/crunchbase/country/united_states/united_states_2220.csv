LoveSuze was born out of Suzanne's passion for quality lingerie, decades of industry know-how, and one-on-one conversations in fittings to deliver what consumers really want. This manifested into LoveSuze's signature Flex-Sizing®: modern sizing that embraces the natural changes of a woman's body for a perfect fit with every wear. The LoveSuze brand recognizes a woman's body is constantly in flux. All bras, underwear, bodysuits, and slips are made with Flex-Sizing® fabrics that stretch and mold to every unique shape, providing all-day comfort and support. Regardless of age, cup size, waist, pre or post-natal body, LoveSuze pieces are designed for the best fit and flatter, no matter where a woman's weight fluctuates. Focused on modernizing lingerie, LoveSuze bridges the gap between sexiness and comfort; rejecting the idea that the two can't coexist. With LoveSuze, a woman's most comfortable intimates are also her sexiest. Beyond bras and underwear, LoveSuze inspires confidence in all customers—unlike anything else in their dresser.
