With our unique approach of leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and neural networks, KAPUA's customers enjoy MAPEs (mean absolute percentage error) and WMAPEs (weighted mean absolute percentage error) in the lower single digits. This increased accuracy allows organizations to lower working capital while improving fulfillment levels.   Related research in this field suggests a 3M profit increase on a 100M business driven by a 10-20% improvement of forecasting accuracy, and KAPUA set out to take this even further. In multiple cases, we're able to reduce a company's forecasting error to a 10th of what it was before. As AI is taking over a lot of the manual work, planners can now focus on developing new strategies to maximize revenue and minimize working capital.   Because AI is able to detect patterns in your internal and external data sets, our implementation approach becomes really low-touch and therefore extremely accelerated: we can set up a tenant in our public or private SaaS environment within a few weeks from start to finish.
