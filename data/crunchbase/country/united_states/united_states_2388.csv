Liven yours up at MezzoPrint.com.,"2,828,326","Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",Less than $1M,Active,2016-06-01,month,,,,,For Profit,http://mezzoprint.com,"THE MEZZOPRINT STORY When founders Robert and Andre first met, they were notable event coordinators in the New York City party scene. They didn’t know each other but had heard rumors of the impressive events the other had organized. Soon, Rob and Dre started attending each other’s events to see what all the hype was about.  Months later, Rob and Dre found themselves at the same event on New Year’s Eve. Dre had coordinated one of the biggest nights of the year and Rob decided to see it for himself. The club owner saw Rob, and knowing that the two were wildly successful in the same industry decided it was about time to break the ice and make introductions.  FROM PROMOS TO PINHOLES  Rob and Dre went from fierce competitors to fast friends. After New Year’s, the two began brainstorming ways to team up and improve their events by collaborating together. Quickly, Rob and Dre realized they had a knack for recognizing early trends and bringing them to the masses.  While abroad in Spain, Rob witnessed a few party-goers wearing glasses with a series of pinhole-sized perforations and realized the huge potential of bringing this trend to the states.  Predicting that the Pinhole Glasses trend was on the brink of explosion, Rob and Dre agreed to partner together in a new business venture. Bringing Pinhole Glasses to the next level, the duo was able to expand the product’s reach within the US market. They decided to take production into their own hands and bought their own printing machine in 2013 and parked it in their garage in Queens, NY. And with that, Life Of The Party (LOTP) Marketing Solutions was born. Soon, Rob and Dre’s Pinhole Glasses found their way into every club, bar, birthday party, concert and wedding in the New York City market, and people wanted more. Owners, promoters, brides and partiers asked what else the duo offered, and Rob and Dre’s business expanded to include customized t-shirts, selfie frames, glow batons along with various other custom party gear.  Word spread, and Rob and Dre started fielding calls from New York City business owners. These companies were looking for custom promotional items, too -- mugs, pens, t-shirts, and banners, to name a few -- and Rob and Dre accepted the challenge. With word of their impeccable service, fierce customer loyalty, and quick turnaround time spreading quickly, Andre emptied his savings account in order for LOTP to accommodate the swelling demand for their service. They quickly purchased two additional printing machines to accommodate all of their clients needs, risking it all for a business venture they felt passionately about.  THE EVOLUTION OF LOTP The risk paid off, and Rob and Dre were soon running a high-quality printing business selling promotional items that continued to grow exponentially. They remained committed to their customer base and soon became known as a trustworthy and reliable team to work with that consistently and quickly delivered on all their clients needs. A year later, they housed multiple printing machines in the garage (and even one in the living room!) to keep up with the orders.  While the in-house work put a strain on Rob and Dre, they knew it was worth it to learn the ins-and-outs of the printing business. Since day one, the duo have been taking hands-on control of the process, which has allowed them to be directly responsible for delivering high quality promotional products at the speedy turnaround rate that their customers love. After three years running successfully and smoothly as LOTP Marketing Solutions, Rob and Dre made the decision to streamline their company and focus solely on B2B clients, as they value building long-term relationships servicing their clients top-to-bottom. In the late spring of 2016, MezzoPrint was born and moved to an office in Valley Stream, New York. MEZZOPRINT TODAY Calling themselves MezzoPrint—a play on the word mezzotint, a process of unique printmaking—Rob and Dre’s client portfolio has since grown to over 100 clients in a variety of industries, including Clinique, the City University of New York, Tupperware, PRIDE Global, and Air France.   With extensive knowledge of the nonprofit, hospitality, and higher education industries, MezzoPrint has the product and professionalism fit for any mid-level business, organization or corporate entity. We support our clients with the same top-notch customer service that Rob and Dre brought to the industry years ago. MezzoPrint is fully committed to delivering the exact customized products our customers are looking for in a timely and reliable manner.  We value our customers and their needs above all else. We know that having your custom company-branded water bottles in time for Office Olympics is key to making the day that much better, and we’re here to deliver on that. Need a bulk order of custom golf balls? We’ve got that covered too. As a one-stop shop, we’re here to walk you through each step to match you with the ideal line of products for you and your company’s needs. We’ll then get right to work printing your desired logo or message, packing it up, and shipping it safely to your doorstep on your desired date. With everything executed in-house, we pride ourselves on being accessible, transparent, and completely reliable at every stage of the process. When it comes down to it, we’re just big fans of people. Networking with them, getting to know them, understanding their needs, and how best to enhance their experience -- whether it’s promoting a business’s brand or coordinating the perfect event. MezzoPrint has given us the opportunity to expand our love for servicing people, and in turn, turning those people into lifelong customers and excellent friends.  THE MEZZOPRINT FAMILY  [include images in this portfolio page] Helping to bring Air France’s “FRANCE is in the Air” campaign to the masses, MezzoPrint provided folding fans with the Air France logo on them as part of a widely-successful branding campaign. When skincare giant Clinique wanted to bring customized selfie frames and cosmetic shopping bags to enhance their shoppers’ social experience, MezzoPrint was there to accommodate their needs. Printing over 20,000 bags on short notice, delivering what their competitors could not, MezzoPrint helped Clinique promote their brand across the regional Northeast.  When Tupperware wanted to get more social media attention while hosting events across the country, they turned to MezzoPrint to bring them customized selfie-sticks for their national sales force.  PRIDE Global, a network of companies focused on a diverse array of human resources solutions, chose MezzoPrint to supply promotional office items for their five subsidiaries, including Russel Tobin, PrideOne, and Pride Health. MezzoPrint was also responsible for providing beach balls, headbands, glasses, and other event items and giveaways during the Pride Parade in NYC and other pride-related events.  When Queens College sought a full-service company for its promotional needs, MezzoPrint was there to deliver high-quality t-shirts, office supplies, wristbands, ribbons, glasses and more.

Although Tracey's career began in ""big law,"" it was not until she became a mother that she recognized the need for a more personally tailored education. As such, she took a sabbatical from practicing law and ultimately became a teacher. Given this on-the-ground experience with adolescents, Tracey was able to more firmly identify where the educational system was succeeding and where it direly needed to be reformed. Using this insight, as well as her students, as inspiration, Tracey Spencer Walsh founded Spencer Walsh Law, which specializes in Special Education Law, Constitutional Rights of Children, Guardianship, Securing Educational Services, and Private School Tuition Reimbursement. One of the focuses at Spencer Walsh Law is to help students receive the special education services that they are entitled to under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Throughout the years, Tracey and her firm have helped countless families with cases for private school tuition reimbursement on behalf of the students for disabilities, including learning disabilities, autism, and Down syndrome.

Sometimes, they even end up paying professional résumé writers. This creates an frustrating barrier, preventing them from just diving right in.

More often than not, it is nothing more than a static, lifeless file sitting on somebody’s desktop, when it should instead be more of a web-based utility.
