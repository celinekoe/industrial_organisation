The primary business of Earth Gen-Biofuel Inc. (“Earth Gen”) is the cultivation of non-food agricultural products for use in manufacturing processes, renewable energy and transportation fuel.  Earth Gen is the largest U.S. based grower of castor beans in Southeast Asia. The company’s goal is to become one of the largest producers of castor beans in Southeast Asia and other tropical growing areas.  Earth Gen’s management started working in Southeast Asia in 2010 and incorporated as a U.S. company as Earth Gen Biofuel Inc. in 2012 to begin formal operations.  Earth Gen is farming castor beans to satisfy current demands for chemical processes that use castor oil required by chemical conversion facilities in China and by other major importers of castor beans such as Japan, Taiwan, Europe and the United States.   Castor beans are an agricultural crop already in short supply and in high demand for processing manufactured products in many countries and in multiple areas of the economy. Castor bean cultivation has attracted attention as a “renewable energy crop” with high value due to its high oil content in comparison to other oil seed crops.  Earth Gen’s business model is focused on meeting this growing demand without competing against potentially more important food crops by cultivating land for growing castor beans in areas of poor soil conditions where such cultivation does not replace the production of food. As the world supply of castor beans grows along with Earth Gen’s production, the Company will benefit from a “tipping point” created when there is enough surplus castor bean supply to allow for its use as biodiesel.  Based on current commercial demand for castor bean oil and the long term demand for clean fuel, management believes that, subject to obtaining the necessary capital, Earth Gen is positioned for rapid near term and long term growth due to the favorable industry conditions that persist in China, the United States and Europe The concept behind Earth Gen’s operations began in 2010 when Earth Gen’s present management started establishing relationships with farmers, government officials and related agencies in Laos to obtain the necessary local knowledge and expertise with the goal of starting large-scale castor bean cultivation in Southeast Asia. Earth Gen was incorporated in August of 2012 to formalize its business operations. In May 2013, Earth Gen started testing its planting programs in Laos and Vietnam. The purpose of these tests was to evaluate various growing methods and hybrid castor bean types to refine our planting protocol.  In March 2014, Earth Gen started its first large scale castor bean cultivation operations near the city of Xieng Khouang in the northeastern part of Laos.  Between April and July, the Company has prepared nearly 700 acres and completed the planting process, with a projected harvest date starting in September and October of 2014. Earth Gen now has over 1,200 acres and has negotiated agreements to expand to 30,000 acres over the next few years.  Earth Gen first phase 700 acre farm is providing jobs for 50 full time employees and 120 part time employees. Earth Gen is working with local leaders and government in the area of its farms to create programs to benefit the area population with medical services, educational opportunities and other long term programs for support of the area.","Agriculture and Farming, Energy, Food and Beverage, Government and Military, Sustainability",,,11-50,,IPO,,,,,,,,,,,Public,2016-11-09,,,EGBB,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/earthgen-biofuel-ipo--7f72483e,OTC Pink

The Illustris technology platform (""ITP"") both enables the delivery of large molecules (of at least 500KD) through tissue structures, and optimizes the absorption of compounds typically delivered through skin, eyes and mucosal (oral or vaginal) surfaces and also has agricultural applications. The ITP facilitates the delivery of active agents through tissue structures by deploying “decoys”, many of which temporarily distract and relax anchors that bind tissue cells together, providing a portal for active agents to permeate the targeted site.
