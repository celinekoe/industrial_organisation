In the same way Uber facilitates on-demand ride services, Fresh Direct on-demand groceries, and Netflix on-demand movies, ImaSpanse helps people find the world's biggest commodity: other people. Facebook and Meetup services force users to plan weeks, days, and hours before an event begins. ImaSpanse knows that planning is not in style anymore. People need to study now. They need to sell concert tickets now. They need to eat now. ImaSpanse shows people who and what is nearby, and gives them the tools to connect and make it happen.    While users are finding businesses through ImaSpanse, businesses are able to reach out to their consumers. Business discovery services like Yelp are static: businesses have no say in their image. But ImaSpanse moves with a business. It allows them to not only be on the go, but send location-based push marketing notifications directly to their customers phones. Today these services are primarily housed in third party apps. This requires a customer to download each corporation’s app (Starbucks, Dunkin Doughnuts, CVS, Walgreens...) cluttering phones. Most small businesses don't have and frankly don't want an app, but they would love to send their customers notifications. ImaSpanse provides access to this service as painlessly as Square gives small businesses access to accepting credit card payments.     ImaSpanse is quick, fast, and the answer to the next trend on the horizon: on-demand meeting. They make it as easy as calling an Uber, and as fun as curling up with a movie on Netflix, and as simple as swiping right on Tinder.","Apps, Commerce and Shopping, Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Messaging and Telecommunications, Mobile, Navigation and Mapping, Software",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
