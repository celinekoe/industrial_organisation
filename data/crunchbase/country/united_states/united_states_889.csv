Fleets are using antiquated systems to run their dispatch operation and up until now, these companies have had no cost effective way to modernize their business.  These fleets in secondary and tertiary markets understand the need to move from a paper and pen environment to a digital one. They understand the need to give their passengers a better experience by providing them with a mobile hail experience. They also understand that they need a better understanding of where their cars are in order to efficiently manage their fleet.    PerGo is solving this problem by providing these for-hire vehicle companies a completely vertical automated dispatch solution that helps increase efficiencies from the moment they start. While modernizing their operations, these companies are seeing immediate savings in their cost of doing business and in turn increasing their bottom line. PerGo gives dispatchers and base administrators the tools to provide better service for their customers as well as their drivers.","Sales and Marketing, Software",2,"Josh Kadden, Lawrence Thaler",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
