Users begin by filling out a brief, one-time questionnaire about their food, atmosphere, and value preferences. From there, it's one click to two great recommendations, tailored specifically to the user's tastes, anywhere in the US. Users can always get great recommendations without any fiddling, but if they're going on a date, planning a fancy dinner, wanting to try something unique, or just a particular cuisine, Qmato makes it easy to do that too. After getting the recommendations, if the user doesn't feel like eating a particular cuisine, or doesn't feel like paying that much or traveling so far, Qmato makes it easy to request a new recommendation that's a better fit. Qmato starts by recommending the very best personalized match based on the user's preferences, restaurant rating, and suitability for the occasion. If the user is staying in a place for more than one day, then variety becomes important too. So from one day to the next, Qmato gradually expands the pool from which it draws recommendations. That means users can get recommendations from Qmato every day and always end up at a new, interesting place.  Qmato's recommendations come with a brief explanation that explains why each restaurant is a great fit. Users can click through to see a full description of each restaurant. Qmato provides superb restaurant recommendations right from the start, but then goes further. As users rate restaurants, Qmato learns about their likes and dislikes and uses this information to make each user's recommendations even better over time. Qmato lists over 800,000 restaurants nationwide, so users can be confident its recommendations are truly the best options available. Qmato provides the full menus for hundreds of thousands of restaurants, often using direct links to the menu on the restaurant's own website - so users get the most up-to-date menu info available anywhere. Qmato also displays the business hours and other key details for hundreds of thousands of more places, so users always know what to expect. Qmato's Recommended list gives users a snapshot of the most unique and recommended items at nearly every restaurant. Users can also search for menu items to find the best burrito (etc.) in town. Often users will run across an interesting restaurant that just doesn’t fit the bill right now. Users can easily save these restaurants for later. They can keep track of their favorite places and make and share their own lists. Qmato also lets users browse full search results in two different views, write restaurant reviews, and follow other Qmato users to stay updated on their ratings, reviews, and lists. Qmato includes a powerful keyword search that can be used to find something specific or just unusual. Users can describe what they’re looking for in natural language - for example, “bright airy lunch spot” or “cheap vegetarian dinner” - and Qmato will return the most fitting results.","Food and Beverage, Mobile, Sales and Marketing",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

I would like to highlight the prominence posfish.com a browser based video chat facility for different kind of websites and why this is better than text chat. eCommerce websites: Many eCommerce websites today offer text chat facility to the users with rise in eCommerce sales it is very important to convince the customer at point of sale as he always have alternatives to buy from other store. Points to be considered for eCommerce sites  1. Build trust factor by showing face 2. Give optimum information to customer on product and offer(live product demo is also possible) 3. Reduce telecom costs 4. Making customer buy immediately 5. Reduce shopping cart abandonment by placing chat icon in exit pages making customer to rethink on buying.  6. generally Old adage customers are confused while buying online video chat will help them buy more easily. 7. Cash on delivery orders can be immediately booked through customer care making a quick sale with out use of credit card. Travel websites 1. By creating a personal travel assist program linked to video chat enables customers feel better to book travel arrangement through assistant with out taking any stress. 2. customer care can just send invoice and link to buy directly from payment gateway 3. Can also assist during cancellations and change in schedules.  Banking and Insurance These days making any one buy insurance or financial products is through web portal as trust factor would be missing this being completely virtual. By Using Video chat sale pitch can be delivered properly and point of sales can be made easy. This also generates lot of leads for follow ups if sales does not happen. Hotels Having a website for hotel and making customer book rooms for them directly can be of great help for customers. Lead Generation websites Many websites today just do advertising to get maximum leads for sales process. By having video chat option in their website enables them to get maximum leads as customer would like to give a try and see how this works. Product Demonstration and customer service When ever there is a issue with product many users today call helpline given by company and try to reach customer care to explain the technical issue they are facing with product or they are not sure how to use the product. With Video chat facility customer care can give them a live demo on how to use and what do in case of problem in real time helping the customer. The same when done over phone can take lot of time as customer or agent may not be able to explain the real problem. These are very few areas where customer video support has high prominence. while this facility by default can be provided to any website for better user engagement.,"Commerce and Shopping, Information Technology, Internet Services, Messaging and Telecommunications, Other, Professional Services, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The product is based on NASA technology, which was licensed to the company after Tellus won the Space Race competition. Aircraft engines are extremely loud, and the situation is further impacted by ever increasing air traffic across the globe. To address the issue, the FAA and similar entities overseas have established a roadmap for stricter noise regulations at airports. By 2025 manufacturers must reduce noise by 39Db. Engine manufacturers themselves and existing acoustic treatment companies are developing various solutions for this problem. Tellus is focusing on the acoustic liner, which is a component of a jet engine that is designed to limit sound emissions. It is made from a strong, lightweight Ceramic Composite material with great temperature resistance. The key to our technology are that it is capable of multi-frequency sound suppression combined with a low-profile footprint.Even though current players are well established, our advantage in penetrating the marketplace is that our solution is complementary to current and developing technologies. The jet engine market is expected to top $500B in the next decade and noise reduction is a crucial factor for success of engine designs. The industry of aircraft engines is dominated by five major companies: GE Aviation, CFM International, Rolls Royce, Pratt & Whitney and International Aero Engines.  The business model consists of designing and manufacturing the product and selling directly to our target markets of business and commercial engine manufacturers. Our go-to-market strategy is to start working with business class engine manufacturers.

Everywhere we look, there is a decline in giving, especially amongst millennials. So we asked the question, why? We believe it's because organizations aren't catering to the needs of the younger generation. Millennials, like it or not, want to see transparency in where their money goes. How it's being used. What sort of impact is directly generated from the money they're giving. Traditional fundraising often lacks that level of intimate donating. Enter the new way to raise money online. The process is simple. Togetherr is built on a system of squares, numbered 1...2...3—all the way to, let's say 150 (or any other arbitrary number). When a user wants to donate, they simply select a square with the appropriate amount they'd like to donate. So if a user selects the square of 50, they'll donate $50. The next user can now donate the $49 square or $51 square, or any other available amount on the grid. Once all the squares are donated, the organization will have gross raised $11,325. A pretty sizable amount of money for a relatively small ask. The organization has asked 150 people for money, with the highest amount being $150, and they've raised over $11k. We think that's pretty neat!","Financial Services, Internet Services, Other",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
