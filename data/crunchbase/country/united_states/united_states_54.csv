The four songs of the all-new Upside Out EP represent the first preview of Hungry Ghosts, due out in the fall on the band’s own Paracadute. This is the band’s fourth full-length and the newest addition to a curriculum vitae filled with experimentation in a variety of mediums. The band worked with longtime producer and friend Dave Fridmann (Flaming Lips, Weezer, MGMT), while also enlisting a new collaborator in Los Angeles, veteran Tony Hoffer, (Beck, Phoenix, Foster the People) to create their most comfortable and far-reaching songs yet. Building on (and deconstructing) 15 years of pop-rock smarts, musical friendship, and band-of-the-future innovations the EP, Upside Out, offers a concise overview of forthcoming Hungry Ghosts’ melancholic fireworks (“The Writing’s on the Wall”), basement funk parties (“Turn Up The Radio”), IMAX-sized choruses (“The One Moment”), and space-age dance floor bangers (“I Won’t Let You Down”). Drawn from the same marching orders issued to big-hearted happiness creators as Queen, T. Rex, The Cars or Cheap Trick, and a lifetime of mixed tapes exchanged by lifelong music fans, Upside Out is a reaffirmation of the sounds and ideas that brought the band together in the first place. The four songs provide an assured kick-off to a new sequence of interconnected performances, videos, dances, and wild, undreamt fun. “As the band has evolved over the last 15 years, the creative palette they work with has expanded in so many unexpected and gratifying directions,” says frontman Damian Kulash. “This record feels like it’s the musical manifestation of that — like they can speak in a clearer voice when they are playing in a bigger sandbox. Just as the band’s whole project became clearer to us as they learned to find more homes for their creativity — they triangulated it from more directions. And, I think the music itself has gotten more focused for similar reasons. They went in with fewer preconceptions of who they are or what their sound is, and came out with a record that sounds much more uniquely their own because of it.” Continuing a career that includes viral videos, New York Times op-eds, a major label split and the establishment of a DIY trans-media mini-empire, collaborations with pioneering dance companies and tech giants, animators and Muppets, OK Go continue to fearlessly dream and build new worlds in a time when creative boundaries have all but dissolved.","Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

We envision a just, equitable and sustainable world in which women and girls have resources, voice, choice and opportunities to realize their human rights. The Global Fund for Women was founded in Palo Alto California by three bold women: Anne Firth Murray, Founding President, Frances Kissling, and Laura Lederer. The three were convinced that women’s human rights and dignity were essential to the advancement of global agendas for social, economic, and political change. Frustrated by traditional philanthropy’s lack of interest in funding women’s groups and human rights, they forged a new path, founding an organization that would fund women-led organizations directly. Musimbi Kanyoro joined the organization in 2011 – a pivotal time when we embarked on a new strategic direction to support women’s leadership and women-led solutions. In 2012 Global Fund surpassed the $100 million mark in grantmaking. In 2013, our 25th anniversary year, Global Fund refocused its programmatic emphasis by adding a stronger component of learning, monitoring and evaluation. In March 2014, Global Fund for Women and the International Museum of Women – IMOW – merged to create a bold force for women’s human rights. The merger brings together IMOW’s skills in awareness raising, online advocacy and digital story-telling with Global Fund on-the-ground relationships and grant-making activities with women leaders and women’s rights organizations around the world.","Community and Lifestyle, Media and Entertainment, Other",3,"Anne Firth Murray, Frances Kissling, Laura Lederer",51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

In China, demand for methanol is very strong and growing dramatically.     BHE's team of 8 members is skilled and capable. We are raising seed capital. BHE seeks investment from individuals ($10,000 - $25,000 range each) and groups.     Timing for the project is excellent. US gas producers are highly motivated to find new markets. Low cost US natural gas enables BHE's project to be economically attractive.     The project uses US natural gas as feedstock to produce methanol. Methanol is used in China to produce olefins which are then used to produce plastics. HIgh volume plastics manufacturing is China's strategic plan. Massive construction is now underway in China to expand olefin production capacity.     In China, methanol is produced from coal. Over use of coal is causing severe air and water pollution. Since the Chinese Government’s “war on pollution” declaration in March, 2014, coal use in China is increasingly restricted. Today Chinese groups seek alternative sources of methanol from overseas. Several groups plan to make large investments outside of China in methanol plants to control supply costs rather than buy """"retail"""" priced methanol from large, foreign owned companies. Also, Chinese groups seek local country partners for such endeavors. They seek well developed projects that are major investment ready.     BHE's USA based project is a very good fit for major Chinese investment. BHE's site is already EPA permitted and ready for methanol plant investment and construction. BHE’s team works closely with top engineering and GTL (Gas-To-Liquids) technology companies - skilled in design, construction and operating methanol (and polyolefin) plants.     BHE's team is experienced in managing petro-chemical projects and working closely with Asian groups.
