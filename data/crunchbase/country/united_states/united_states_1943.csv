Ryan McMillan is an oil and gas recruiter for a booming oil service company out of Canada. During his time as a recruiter, he found that many sites offer various job categories. Yet, none or very few are specific to the oil and gas industry alone. By specializing in this niche market, both employers and potential candidates can focus on finding the right talent  or company to utilize their talents.  The idea for the site is simple. We will offer candidates the ability to post resumes and create a profile (similar to LinkedIn). These candidates will be able to apply for jobs posted by employers, yet it will be different than other sites. Candidates  will be able to subscribe to a featured candidate package where their profile will be features on the home page of the website.  Employers will also be able to create a business profile. This will offer them a chance to tell about their company  (benefits, salaries, locations, 401k, etc.).  Just like the features candidate, employers will also have the opportunity to purchase a featured employer package. This will display them on the home page on the opposite side of the featured candidate. Businesses will also be able to purchase job posting packages (5 for $100, 20 for $400, or unlimited monthly postings for $500 a month).  All candidate options will be free except the featured candidate profile. The ability to search jobs and post resumes will be a free service.  We are very excited about making this project a reality. We are currently applying for an LLC and working with developers to get the programming in order. We are expecting to go live with this project in 6 months or less.","Administrative Services, Energy, Natural Resources, Professional Services",,,1-10,1,,5000,USD,5000,5000,USD,5000,,,,,Private,,,,,,
