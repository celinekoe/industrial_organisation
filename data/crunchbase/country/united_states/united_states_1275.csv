HEAR IT FROM OUR USERS: Start my morning off RIGHT!!! by vaioAcqua. This app changed the way I lead my day and the way I wake up in the morning! It's made me think differently of the way I think and feel about my surroundings and myself! Love the app and can't wait for more!!!! Great app! by BeingMANUTD. This is a one of the better apps for mindfulness and meditation. The guided narrations are peaceful and calm. THE SCIENCE OF MINDFULNESS Mindfulness meditation has proven to increase and decrease certain areas of the brain for optimal function. It increases neurons and connections in the pre-frontal cortex, responsible for emotion regulation, the right anterior insula, associated with attention and awareness, the left hippocampus responsible for learning & memory, and the tempero-parietal junction, related to perspective, empathy and compassion. It also shrinks the amygdala, the “fight or flight” part of the brain associated to anxiety, fear and stress. SUBSCRIPTION & PRICING Welzen is free to download and use.

Founded in 1965 by Dr. Bernard Rimland, Dr. Ruth Sullivan and many other parents of children with autism, the Autism Society is the leading source of trusted and reliable information about autism. Through its strong national network of affiliates, the Autism Society has spearheaded numerous pieces of state and local legislation, including the 2006 Combating Autism Act, the first federal autism-specific law.

The Autism Society’s national office is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland. The Autism Society is proud to be one of the few organizations to have members on the autism spectrum serving as active members of our board directors as well as in other leadership positions throughout the organization. Temple Grandin was the first member-elected person with autism to serve on the Autism Society Board of Directors, in 1988.  The Autism Society’s Panel of Professional Advisors (PPA) sets the standards for our Options Policy that governs our practices, and we are proud to count the top professional autism experts on our PPA. The Autism Society’s Advisory Panel of People on the Spectrum of Autism (PSA) is a first-of-its-kind advisory panel comprised solely of individuals with autism who help Autism Society staff create programs and services that will advocate for the right of all people with autism to live fulfilling, interdependent lives.  Each year, people with autism, families and professionals volunteer thousands of hours to help the Autism Society achieve its mission of improving the lives of all those affected by autism. To each and every one of you, thank you.

The institutional banks, lenders and REO owners have already written non-performing assets down. The banks and other institutions (holders of these assets) are not prepared to handle a quick and orderly disposition of the non-performing assets. In addition, the Federal Regulatory agencies are requiring the banks and other institutions to liquidate non-performing assets to comply with regulations including the Dodd-Frank law.    With Banks paying historic low interest rates on savings accounts and the volatility of the stock market, many investors are obtaining very low yields on their money. Investors are looking for options to increase monetary performance through other investment vehicles.    CSN has the resources to source and acquire the notes and REOs from the institutions.    CSN will purchase and quickly reposition these non-performing notes and assets. Some of these acquired notes will be modified to become re-performing and sold to cash flow investors. Other notes will be converted to REOs by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure and foreclosures and they will be sold as quickly as possible. The company plans to convert the notes and REOs to cash and then re-invest the original partnership equity and distribute the profits quarterly.    CSN’s profits will be derived from the spread between the deeply discounted purchases and the subsequent sale of the notes and REOs.    Management is not salaried and will look to profit participation for its compensation.    $3,000,000 Capital raise to purchase non-performing 1st position notes in real estate and institutional real estate owned (REO).    The membership interests are $10,000 each or multiples thereof. Membership interests are available only to accredited investors.
