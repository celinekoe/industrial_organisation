Website Development,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/website-development,"Advertising, Web Development","Coral Springs, Florida, United States",SOSStevie.com is a freelance agency that provides quality but highly affordable.,"1,581,211","Greater Miami Area, East Coast, Southern US",,Active,,,,,,,For Profit,http://sosstevie.com/,"I am a freelance web development agency servicing the south Florida area, although I have clients from all over the world.  I often tell my clients who are starting their online businesses that they should try and spend as little as possible on their website design and leave the bulk of their starting capital for other, more pressing matters. Owning a website is only the beginning and is not by any means a guarantee for success.  Because you build it, doesn’t mean you clients will find it.  Anyone who tells you otherwise isn’t being honest with you. But with the right approach and the appropriate level of expectation, I can certainly help you achieve your goals. Here are my main areas of expertise: 1. Website Design If you are on a small budget, there are three ways I can help you. 1.       I can design a basic site for free, but you’ll have to host your site with me.  My hosting fees are in line with what you would pay a reputable hosting company directly and in exchange for giving me your hosting business, I’ll build a basic site for you for free. 2.       If you are a “do it yourself kind of person” and want to build your own website but need a professional website developer to “hold your hand”, then I can do that for a small fee. 3.       You can hire me to create a site for you, at a really affordable rate.  You don’t have to host your site with me, although I would prefer if you hosted your site with a company I’d recommend. 2. Website Marketing Your website may have all the bells and whistles you can think of, but if your clients don’t know about it, it might as well not exist at all. There are several ways to ensure that your website can, over time, gain popularity and begin to attract visitors. Here are some of them: -   Organic searches. This is what google (and other search engines) provide for free and a top organic search ranking can be the subject of fierce competition. There are no magic formulas that enable a site to climb its way up to the top.  There are however proven methods that can assist in doing so. -   Content marketing is one of them. I offer a highly competitive seo article writing service which can greatly help a site rank higher for judiciously selected keywords. -   Links from authority sites within the targeted industry are also known to pay a determining role in the search engines algorithms. Getting links from authority sites is not always easy, but I can help you with that. -   Social Media. By now, everybody knows the power of social media. And very few know how to harness it. I offer a social media signal service. -   Local Business Ranking.  This is the name of the seo game now.  Type anything in google on your device and you’ll see a list of websites and businesses within your own geographical neighborhood. I can help you harness that awesome power.","Advertising, Sales and Marketing, Software",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
