Along with its partners, EEFC provides expert solutions in mini hydro electric, wind, solar, Waste to Energy (WTE) and Waste to Fuel for power generation and electrical transmission and distribution Systems and specialize in the development of MSW and RDF processing. Process of Converting Waste to Energy Generally, WTE facilities can be divided into two process types: mass burn and refuse-derived fuel (RDF). Mass burn facilities process raw waste that has not been shredded, sized, or separated before combustion, although large items such as appliances and hazardous waste materials and batteries are removed before combustion. In mass burn systems, untreated MSW is simply burned, with the heat produced converted into steam, which can then be passed through a steam turbine to generate electricity or used directly to supply heat to nearby industries or buildings. RDF is a result of processing MSW to separate the combustible fraction from the noncombustible’s, such as metals and glass. RDF is mainly composed of paper, plastic, wood, and kitchen or yard wastes, and has higher energy content than untreated MSW. Like MSW, RDF is then burned to produce steam and/or electricity. A benefit of using RDF is that it can be shredded into uniformly sized particles or compressed into briquettes, both of which facilitate handling, transportation, and combustion. Another benefit of RDF rather than raw MSW is that fewer noncombustibles such as heavy metals are burned.","Consumer Electronics, Energy, Hardware, Manufacturing, Natural Resources, Sustainability",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

In a world where journalists are often taking physical and/or financial risks to work in the field they love as freelancers, the Pitch Place is working to try and reduce those risks every way we can. We are creating a network of media professionals -- including editors, content producers, writers, photographers, videographers, fixers, translators, and experts -- so that: - when breaking news happens, media outlets can easily locate the best freelance talent they need to cover the story immediately - freelancers can pitch story ideas efficiently, based on their expertise and qualifications - editors only receive alerts to story ideas that match their criteria - community standards on pricing, fairness, and copyright are met and respected - journalists know they are working with professionals with a proven track record in the industry - getting paid for a job well done is standard policy - finding the right journalism job for you is a click away How does it work: In each of the following sections, media professionals can connect with each other, agree on the terms of a job, and, once completed, pay and get paid for a job well done. Pitches The Pitch Place is a like a dating service for journalists and editors: each fill out their profile and when a pitch is posted only those who are a match for each other will get an email alert about the details of the pitch. Meanwhile, the teaser and title of the pitch are posted in the community Pitch feed for all registered members to see. Grants, fellowships, awards, events, and PR announcements are also posted on this feed and members can filter the feed to suite their needs. Jobs Journalism jobs, contract positions, freelance gigs -- anything that requires hiring the skills of a media professional are listed on our community Jobs feed. People Members of the Pitch Place are media professionals in the field; the story-tellers; the photojournalists; the writers of history in the making; those capturing life's events in the moment; and the content producers and editors in charge of the gateways reaching the public eye.","Commerce and Shopping, Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment, Professional Services",1,Philippe Bregeon,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

ATS Workholding,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ats-workholding,"Hardware, Manufacturing, Web Design","Santa Margarita, California, United States",ATS Systems was created in July of 2006 when ATS Workholding purchased SMW Systems. Both firms had long heritages in the machine tool,"448,906","West Coast, Western US",$50M to $100M,Active,2006-01-01,year,2013-12-03,day,,,For Profit,http://www.ats-s.com,"ATS Systems was created in July of 2006 when ATS Workholding purchased SMW Systems. Both firms had long heritages in the machine tool accessory business. The merger created a firm with unusual product breadth and an unsurpassed team of more than 60 staff, with headquarters in Rancho Santa Margarita, California. Our nationwide, local regional managers provide in-shop sales consultations to match the right products to applications. Our operations staff engineer, build, and configure these products. And our service technicians install them, teach manufacturers their safe use, and support them for their lifetime. Prior to the acquisition, ATS Workholding had for decades been North America's largest producer of collet-chucks. The firm's products are by now ubiquitous workholding devices, used in almost every machine shop. Founder Bill Murphy started machining in a job shop in 1960. By 1969 he had learned to enjoy the design and engineering aspects of the business, and he started his own job shop, R&M Machine, in Garden Grove California. In 1978, Bill was in need of a collet chuck to work with Warner & Swasey collet pads. He ordered one as an accessory for a new machine and, after 6 months waiting for delivery for the chuck, he decided to make it himself. After using it a short time, he was pleased with the extent to which it improved his lathe's efficiency. He decided to make a 5C collet chuck too. At that time, this product was hard to come by, not readily available off the shelf. This too was very productive; his friends saw it and started asking him to make one for their machines. From there the business proliferated. Bill and his partner Wes Bakke decided to start a company that manufactured and inventoried collet chucks for the entire manufacturing industry. Advanced Tool Systems officially opened its doors March 1, 1981. Bill and Wes worked hard in the succeeding years to increase the product line to cover all common collet chuck applications. Bill eventually bought out Wes's stake in the business, but ATS has hardly been a solo effort since. After 40 years in the industry, Bill notes that there are hundreds of people across the country, many of them customers, who were instrumental in the development of ATS Workholding and its product line. He considers them friends and deeply values their past and continuing contributions. Throughout its development, ATS Workholding has employed many talented operations staff and embraced cutting-edge production processes. Beginning as a CNC shop, the firm has also been an early adopter of multi-tasking and automation processes. All of the above have helped ATS to hone its terrific reputation for customer service and quick delivery. SMW Systems had been founded in 1973 as the exclusive importer of unique, self-contained power chucks and automatic self-centering steadyrests. Both products were imported from a creative German company, SMW Schneider & Weisshaupt. It is a testament to the utility and ingenuity embedded in these products that succeeding generations of each are still among ATS Systems' best selling products. And these first items would be harbingers of the many and varied productivity solutions that SMW Systems introduced to North America in the decades that followed. In 1976, SMW Systems introduced the Ultimate Chuck, the product for which it may have become best known. This quick jaw-change style power chuck has become an essential tool in today's lean manufacturing environment. Thousands of shops use the Ultimate Chuck or competitive copies to slash setup downtime on their CNC lathes. In 1981, SMW Systems expanded beyond workholding products with the introduction of the Swiss-made Omnibar hydrodynamic barfeeder. Three years later, the firm developed the first of its rotary indexers, and shortly thereafter launched the first manual pallet changer. In 1986, the firm introduced to North American manufacturing the short-magazine barfeeder. Competitors at first scoffed at the notion that customers would cut their bars to headstock length. But the payoff of higher spindle speeds, automatic bar-reloading, and significantly reduced floorspace needs convinced a great many to do so. Short magazine style barfeeders are today far and away the most popular barfeeder type, and nearly all barfeeder manufacturers have jumped on the bandwagon to offer them. SMW Systems had been equally innovative with staffing. The firm was the first North American accessory provider to hire nationwide, local sales representatives. It was later the first to hire nationwide, local field service technicians to install its products and teach their safe and proper use. Several of the company's former staff have gone on to take prominent positions of leadership throughout the machine tool industry. In general, though, the firm has enjoyed excellent staff stability and loyalty in recent years. The upshot is that this well-seasoned team has terrific knowledge and experience to help customers properly select and apply its products. ATS Systems has merged these terrific products and, more importantly, people. Our mission is to be the finest provider of machine tool accessories by making available superior sales, service and support resources. We invite you to contact us for any assistance related to your automation and workholding accessory needs.","Design, Hardware, Manufacturing",1,Bill Murphy,51-100,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
