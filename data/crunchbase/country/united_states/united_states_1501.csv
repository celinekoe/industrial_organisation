With a NumberText account, anyone can subscribe to a businessâ€™s list by texting a keyword to the companyâ€™s unique number. For example, a Pizzeria can ask customers to text message the keyword â€œPizzaâ€ to their NumberText phone number.  Every time a customer subscribes, NumberText can automatically text them back a coupon for their next order. They can also remain in constant communication with every subscriber, sending out a text message whenever they run a new promotion or simply want to increase sales.  NumberText can even be used to allow customers to send in their orders by texting a companyâ€™s NumberText number. Every subscriber is organized into group-oriented lists, making it easy to track marketing campaign growth and plan for future, hyper-targeted advertising. NumberText removes the need for shortcodes by giving customers their own unique, non-shared NumberText number. Companies can attract clients and organize their lists with an unlimited number of keywords. The local pizzeria can use the highly-coveted term â€œPizzaâ€ to send offers to pie lovers and â€œCalzoneâ€ to advertise to those that have shown a preference for fold-overs. Whether NumberText customers use one targeted keyword or 100, thereâ€™s no additional charge.
