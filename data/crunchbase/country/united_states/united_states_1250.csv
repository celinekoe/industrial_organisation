Merlin Tuttle founded MTBC in 2014, in order to most effectively share his 60-plus-year legacy of experience, diplomacy, and photographic documentation of bats. Our goal is to empower other organizations and individuals for greater progress. After retiring from more than 30 years of leadership at BCI in 2009, it had become apparent that existing organizations for bats were inadequately prepared to address the most serious new challenges. Furthermore, his collection of over 100,000 Kodachrome slides, which had served as the foundation of bat conservation for decades, was deteriorating and urgently needed to be protected and made digitally accessible. Through MTBC, approximately two-thirds of Merlin's collection, and more than 2,000 images of nearly 300 species are already available for self-serve, shopping-cart-type downloading from our photo gallery by conservationists, educators and publishers worldwide. Additionally, we are providing key resources addressing the most important issues facing bats. We're countering irresponsible disease speculation with sound science. We're documenting much-needed rabies policy changes in America, addressing the need for new directions in WNS policy, and recommending positive approaches to deal with the wind energy crisis, climate change and to overcome pesticide addiction.  MTBC is the only organization licensing Merlin's photos and supporting his ongoing conservation initiatives. Thank you for your interest in bats.

While there are many great artists out there, you’ll be hard-pressed to find anyone who has created a work quite like this one, as this art has been clocked to almost 3,000 hard focused hours!  (***3,000 hours is equal to about 125 full 24-hour days of actual work, or over a year of actual 8 hour a day work).   People talk about extreme music all the time, but you don’t really hear about extreme art.  There are extreme subjects, and “meaning” in artwork perhaps,  but this creation from the mind of Mark Cooper is truly “extreme-art”.   Bandwhore is a project created & arranged by guitarist Jim Ross as a DIY venture under the guise of ""Starved Artist Records"". While current trends of artists and musicians seem to release a handful of albums over a lifetime, Bandwhore releases a lifetime of music ALL AT ONCE!  This debut truly is like nothing else out there. The sheer volume and mass of this music, artwork, and the people involved, make this massive project ""BANDWHORE"" an unprecedented form of musical works for the 21st Century. ***more info at www.bandwhoremetal.com","Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio",1,Jim Ross,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Corda is packed away, deep within the stack and performs the ultra fast and secure P2P transactions expected within distributed ledgering. However, this is like the layer underpinning TCP/IP on the internet, rather than the exposed dApps on most blockchain services. As with the internet, EyA then has multiple layers, including security and CorDapps, again, way below that which even developers will see or use. Instead, we reach up further through the stack to a plethora of API’s, which provide standardised access to data transactions and also to a unique method of creating a database of relational (and not so relational) data fields, which mimic that which an engineer would see within common relational databases like MS SQL This alone allows for rapid connectivity of a company’s current database solution to an interconnected data world. However, EyA takes this way beyond just “dumping” data and transacting within a particular industry. With the higher layers, it is ultra fast to connect to other industries, other data sets, other business operations from any sector, anywhere at anytime. Taking on the internet’s network of networks, EyA has also adopted this method with privacy of data leading the next frontier. Organisation data is never propagated across the EyA cloud, but instead only intrinsic parts of data required to perform any type of transaction are shared between the companies acting within that particular transaction, meaning private data is just that (finally). Again, though, EyA knows that there is data which needs to be open and seen by anybody, for instance product information which a consumer would want to read, or a firmware update to a household router.
