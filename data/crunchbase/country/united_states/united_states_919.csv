When the narrowing is worse, the airway can actually close and obstruct breathing, a condition known as obstructive sleep apnea. Approximately 4-6% of Americans suffer from sleep apnea, but the number is estimated to be higher since many are undiagnosed. Most sleep apnea patients are sleepy during the day, and this is a major cause of traffic and industrial accidents.
