The skyway can accommodate small unoccupied COURIER vehicles, private passenger vehicles, SUVS, VANS, shuttle buses, transit buses, tour buses, delivery vehicles, box trucks, and large freight vehicles.  Overland ATS seamlessly supports all varieties of surface transportation vehicles in all major urban areas and alongside the entire interstate network. Overland ATS can be thought of as an extension of existing urban and interstate highways. Overland ATS integrates the features and functions of commuter rail, regional bus transit, heavy rail, high speed rail, freight rail, and tractor trailers. Overland ATS is a general, all purpose, and robust transportation solution.  Overland will become profitable by marketing, building and operating third party owned Overland ATS Skyway Networks. These are sold by presenting proposals to transportation officials and by submitting proposals on projects proposed by others such as light rail competitors.  Overland ATS is proposing to raise $5 million to develop a proof of concept/demonstration prototype. This funding will also initiate consulting services to support the company until construction revenues are generated.  Overland ATS will be successful because it has the only solution to a Global crisis. The milestones so far have been 8 patents issued and several pending.  The goal is to permanently solve the transportation crisis.",Transportation,1,Waldemar Kissel,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
