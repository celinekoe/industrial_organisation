Tuvoli,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tuvoli,,"Boston, Massachusetts, United States",Get business done anytime from anywhere on your phone or desktop.,"283,104","Greater Boston Area, East Coast, New England",,Active,2019-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,http://www.tuvoli.com,"First and foremost, Tuvoli is a business to business platform. Tuvoli connects brokers (and operators who broker) to suppliers in a fast, efficient, and secure manner. We have built native mobile apps for iOS and Android that promise to let brokers and operators do business anytime, from anywhere. We believe that improving connectivity and leveling the playing field is in everyone's best interest. We need to work together to improve the quality of our product at the industry level, because that is the path to success for us all. Tuvoli has pre-loaded the jet aircraft in the US air charter fleet onto its platform from data published by the FAA. That means that for most charter companies, signing up is as simple as verifying their company and aircraft info. Our team is standing by to assist at any time along the way. Brokers will go through a verification process that may include a request for references. Once on the platform, operators will benefit immediately from free fleet flight tracking. Aircraft in your fleet are displayed on a US map that is updated in real-time. Flight strips provide information on the last flight and up-to-date information on any aircraft that are in the air. Searching for supply or demand begins with entering a point of origin. Our itinerary builder will show you the closest airports to any street address or place name, making it a simple matter to find the closest airport for your customer. Sourcing aircraft is fast and easy. You can select one or more aircraft in the search results and send out requests for quotes in a matter of seconds. Operators can respond to quotes on their desktops or mobile phones, with just a few clicks or taps. One of our truly game-changing features is our built in payment capability. We establish a no-fee FDIC insured bank account for every Tuvoli user (company). From there, our platform facilitates funds transfer between any two parties 24/7/365. We eliminate the risk of ACH fraud because we vette every company before they are allowed to transact on the platform. In addition to the ability to move money, we are introducing the concept of the guaranteed payment for air charter flights. We have been in the industry for decades, and we are quite familiar with the problems we all face. Operators are often waiting for a broker to wire, right down to the wire, or they are accepting a credit card hold, crossing their fingers that the funds will come through. On the other hand, there are plenty of cases where a broker has pre-paid for a trip only to have the aircraft become unavailable at the last minute. Our solution provides for the buyer (broker) to put the funds into a segregated staging account between the time the trip is confirmed and departure time of the flight. The funds are guaranteed to not move from that account until the trip is completed (or cancelled). Once a trip is complete funds can be moved in a matter of minutes (seconds really), and they can be moved any time of day, any day of the year. To sum it up, we believe that for our industry to grow, we have to change. We have to build faster, more secure payment systems, and a layer of connectivity between industry players that can support a faster, more consistent, more reliable product for charter consumers. We hope you'll join us on our quest to grow the air charter industry from the inside out.",,,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Private,,,,,,

Founded in 1988 as a professional services organization, we built custom integrations using procedural code for Silicon Valley companies from 1992 until 2003. This approach was both fragile and required considerable development effort, so we developed a prototype ETL Tool in 2003. Out of that experience, we learned lessons that enabled us to build our first commercial ETL product in 2004. During 2004 and 2005, Sesame Software developed the first two Relational Junction products in response to our customers’ requirement for Enterprise Application Integration and Data Warehousing. The challenges were to provide a reporting database, backup and recovery capability, and an integration platform for Salesforce.com. By splitting the data virtualization and integration capabilities into two kinds of products, we were able to leverage the best of automation and transformation techniques. We continued this approach with NetSuite and QuickBooks replication products in 2007. Today, companies worldwide have come to trust our solutions to provide scalable, reliable integration, compliance, and reporting capability. Sesame Software’s data warehouse and Enterprise Application Integration solutions reduce business risk, eliminate data loss and protect valuable corporate information. The Relational Junction Suite of Enterprise integration products includes specific solutions for Salesforce.com, NetSuite, and QuickBooks that leverage the unique technical requirements of each application without the limitations of plug-ins or Cloud-based technology. SQL-based ETL allows rapid development of unique integrations with minimal training of in-house technical staff. All Sesame Software products are supported by a team of application and data integration experts, allowing organizations to leverage in-house developer skill sets for rapid solution implementation and reliable data management.","Data and Analytics, Design, Information Technology, Other, Professional Services, Software",1,Rick Banister,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Since that time, the landscape has changed dramatically, and most of the indie Hip Hop labels from that period no longer exist. However, thanks to a solid foundation of talent, wisdom and diligence, paired with an unending desire for growth and diversity, Rhymesayers is still here today, over two decades later. The Rhymesayers collective was born in the early 90’s, out of equal parts necessity and opportunity, in a local scene hungry for Minnesota talent to rise. The crew, comprised of a handful of talented artists from Minneapolis & Saint Paul, started building their name by regularly performing in local coffee shops and selling their “Headshots” tapes and merchandise as a means to invest into their future. Years of hard work and reinvestment came to fruition with the founding of Rhymesayers Entertainment in 1995, and its first official releases—1996’s full-length debut from Musab (formerly Beyond),Comparison, and 1997’s full-length debut from Atmosphere, Overcast!. These two releases fueled interest in the label and helped catalyze its expansion to other markets outside of the Twin Cities such as Madison, Milwaukee, Boulder, Denver, Chicago and more, setting the stage for what would become one of their strongest and most enduring qualities: touring and live performances. While the Rhymesayers lineup initially focused on local talent like Musab, Atmosphere, Eyedea & Abilities, and Brother Ali, rigorous touring and consistent exposure helped the label to connect with other like-minded artists throughout the country, which led to new signings and an even more dynamic roster. Additions like MF DOOM, Soul Position, Aesop Rock, Sa-Roc, Evidence, and many others, all played a role in diversifying the label’s sound. The same desire for diversity and growth that has served as a cornerstone of Rhymesayers origins is embedded in its culture, and at the core of its commitment to do business responsibly. With a focus on Social Justice and Creative Arts, Rhymesayers supports and partners with organizations through in kind donations, mentorship, fundraising, community programming, platform sharing, employee volunteerism, and charitable giving. Remaining true to its independent ethos and original principles and philosophies, Rhymesayers continues to grow and evolve.","Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

We’ve spent hundreds of hours talking with builders around the world and trying to understand their daily frictions. Each conversation seems to light a spark. Ask a new question. Focus our attention. Ultimately, these conversations are why we built StruxHub. Repeatedly, we saw that—no matter where you were in the world, how progressive the contractor, how critical the job—Projects still suffered from unplanned delivery trucks showing up and waiting for hours on the street to get on site. This daily chaos was disrupting work and was costing builders time and money. When digging into why this was happening, we found that it was simply that general contractors lacked access to the right tools. Paper forms and whiteboards simply didn’t match the speed and agility needed in orchestrating the real-time coordination needed on complex jobsites. This discovery eventually allowed us to articulate our broader mission at StruxHub; that is, to help builders build better—with greater transparency, with less waste, and with more consistent outcomes. Despite all the activity in construction tech, there is still an enormous opportunity to better serve the day-to-day operational needs of construction professionals in the field.

Other home security systems typically fall into two categories: cheap and ineffective or expensive and one-dimensional. Customers are fooled into thinking they are protected, but many burglars can actually defeat these cheap systems in under 30 seconds. And traditional alarm system companies charge thousands of dollars to put sensors on first floor windows and doors, and even more on bedroom windows and upstairs entry points. Most people simply can't afford what they really need. With LifeShield customers get better protection, reliability, and superior control compared to traditional analog-based security systems.  Plus, LifeShield was one of the first to provide remote access to your home security system. With LifeShield, you have always been able to log into your system from anywhere in the world for free. Some of the other systems are finally able to offer you this same type of access, but you'll pay for it. They'll add an extra cost to your monthly monitoring payments.  And with LifeShield you can access your system even more easily with apps for iPhone, Blackberry, and Android. Look for our iPod application launch coming in July.
