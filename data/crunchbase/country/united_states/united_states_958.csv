When her twins were born premature, Ruth decided to help them be healthy by feeding them a special homemade diet. She realized that there were no books on the market dedicated to making baby food, so to help other mothers she authored and published “Super Baby Food.”  To date, “Super Baby Food” has won numerous awards, has sold over half a million copies, and has featured in many different types of news media. As book sales increased, Ruth leveraged her brand to develop relationships with manufacturers in the industry and to launch www.SuperBabyStore.com.  She started an Amazon FBA store to sell bottles, cups, flatware, breast pumps and many other products to help parents feed their babies safely.

As a nationally licensed health insurance agency and A+ rated by the Better Business Bureau, we stand by our mission--to offer consumers the most comprehensive and simple-to-use platform for comparing the private health plan options that you will not find on the government websites like Healthcare.gov. Agile Health Insurance offers Obamacare alternative health plans: Short-Term Health Insurance - major medical insurance that can be obtained any time of year and protects you in case of injuries or illness. Health Benefit Insurance - Indemnity insurance that pays you a set amount for doctor and hospital services. Dental Insurance - Agile has partnered with some of the best dental insurance companies in the country to help keep your mouth happy and healthy. Telemedicine - you can speak to a doctor 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, administered by Teladoc, the nation’s leading provider in telemedicine services. All of the health insurance plans offered on our site have several important advantages: Usually less than half the premium cost of Obamacare plans. More freedom to choose preferred doctors and hospitals. Can be purchased year round with no blackout dates or Open Enrollment Restrictions. Are underwritten by financially strong entities who are committed to the highest level of customer service. We know shopping for health insurance online can be a difficult, confusing, or a downright opaque experience, so we created the Health Insurance Learning Center to provide answers to common problems experienced by consumers.

We were founded by the same team that pioneered the very first online sale of health insurance in 1999 and collectively, we have helped millions of consumers get coverage.
