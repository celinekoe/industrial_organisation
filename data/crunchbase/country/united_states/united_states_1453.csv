A lot like what Uber has done to the transportation industry, we hope WashMates will do for laundry. Currently there is no national laundromat or dry-cleaner; instead there are dozens of different providers within each various city and state. Although the idea of centralizing laundry may seem like an obvious eventuality, but it’s not when you think about all of the barriers there are to become a laundromat and/or dry-cleaner. When it comes to laundromats, it takes a large space and a large capital investment to open dozens of facilities in every city. The same goes for dry-cleaners, except dry-cleaners, also need special licensing to use the chemicals that are commonly used in the process of dry-cleaning clothes.",,2,"Grant Goodstein, Jackson Jesionowski",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
