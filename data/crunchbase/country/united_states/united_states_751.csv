We’re not a tour. We’re not a news app. We’re the new form of timeless audio journalism. We talked with residents and found that they want to learn more about Chicago, whether they're fresh to the city or lifelong residents. And they want this information to be easily-digestible. We then talked to small business owners and learned that they're having a difficult time finding and/or reaching their audience through traditional advertising channels. We create bite-sized, original audio pieces, essentially mini-podcasts, and tie them to different locations throughout the city. That way, listeners can hear something fun, quirky and new about their surroundings without taking extra time out of their day. We also offer businesses the opportunity to promote themselves through our fun, quirky stories. This allows them to advertise in a more authentic way to potential customers who are within close proximity. We strive to find and tell Chicago’s most interesting and little-known stories so we could make listeners feel smarter and more connected to this beautiful, rich city.

The concept became a reality in 2006 when The Phantom Laboratory saw the need to process the data obtained from the Magphan® Quantitative Imaging, or ADNI (Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative), phantom. The phantom and software was designed by world renowned MRI physicist Richard Mallozzi, Ph.D.. The ADNI phantom and processing algorithm was developed to evaluate the spatial characteristics of MR scanners. The system provides standardized tracking of the spatial fidelity of MRI systems based on the ADNI algorithm. Image Owl’s first priority was to provide a reliable, easy to use, cost-effective service. Since numerous groups want to apply the methodology used in this study, there is a need for a system of standardized tracking of the spatial fidelity of MRI systems based on the ADNI algorithm. Image Owl’s first priority was to provide such a reliable, cost-effective service. The next project was designed to provide Catphan® customers with detailed CT and CBCT performance testing and reports based on their phantom images. Image Owl developed the Catphan® QA service with physicist David Goodenough, Ph.D., a pioneer in the field of CT scanner performance measurements, to ensure the scientific validity of the service and reported results.

We provide an affordable and secure electronic health record solution for fully collaborative healthcare delivery. Our immediate help desk support, personalized training, secure Internet-based architecture, user-friendly design and robust functionality make DocLinks the perfect solution for physician practices, multi-specialty groups and larger medical communities.  The saying ""Time Is Money"" is particularly relevant today as healthcare providers are expected to improve both the quality and efficiency of medical care. Most Electronic Health Record (EHR) Systems perform similar functions, yet there are substantial differences in design which affect the way each system works. Our providers have found DocLinks pays for itself by enabling them to see more patients in less time. As an example, the graph shows the difference in productivity of a single medical group while using a large system EHR and while using DocLinks. Groups transitioning to DocLinks from paper medical records can expect to see even greater gains.  There are many EHRs -- and most of them are run by very large national and international companies. So why should you consider DocLinks? We offer highly efficient software and support that is superior. DocLinks is a state-of-the-art EHR which has a fully integrated practice management system (Healthwind / Insight) to help maximize revenue. In addition, we provide on-site education programs and telephone support whenever you need. Our help desk personnel know DocLinks in depth, work for LIN Software in the United States and usually answer a phone call before the second ring. We add to that a willingness to work with you to build a system that meets all of your needs, including template modifications, custom software and interfaces if needed. We even provide MIPS guidance and consulting services upon request. We know our clients, we work closely with them, and we support them in ways that large EHR companies do not.","Hardware, Health Care, Information Technology, Internet Services, Software",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
