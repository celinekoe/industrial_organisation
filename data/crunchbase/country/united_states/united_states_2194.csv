Using state-of-the-art technology and the Internet, SynaMed makes medical record-keeping simple - leaving doctors free to be doctors. Today, the average physician practice is overwhelmed by mountains of paperwork, as managed care demands ever-increasing amounts of data and documentation. By allowing computers to do what they do best - managing massive amounts of data - SynaMed effectively transfers the burden of data management from man to machine. But SynaMed is much more than just a data management system. It also brings physicians together. In fact, SynaMed was founded with a simple goal - to create a user-friendly, time-saving ""virtual"" community linking the many doctors and other healthcare providers involved in patient care today. But they aim to do much more than merely ""connect"" doctors with one another - they also want to link doctors with the vast array of data currently moving through their medical system. Doctors - who are busier than ever and subject to constant data ""overload"" - need a 21st-century solution. They think the Internet is the key to the solution, and they have created a pioneering Web-based system for the new millennium. It will allow doctors to spend less time on paperwork and more time with their patients. And as it facilitates the exchange of vital medical information, it will also help close some of the gaping holes in their healthcare delivery system.","Health Care, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Their founding principles: Do work that matters and have the greatest impact on the customer's mission.   Every start-up story seems to find its founders working out of a garage. For them an old dentist's office had to suffice. Those early days were both exciting and dark at the same time. Sticking to your principles is easier said than done when you have to make payroll and customers are slow with receivables. They knew that buckling meant their efforts were wasted. They could have stayed at their old, safe, certainly higher-paying jobs if they were just going to be doing business as usual.","Information Technology, Privacy and Security",1,Michael Tanji,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Over time, technology, big-brand growth and quick staff turnover have contributed to an institutional amnesia of the individual customer: who they are, and how they buy. Online retailers like Amazon generate 60% of revenue by acting instantly on knowledge of visiting customers, while local commerce remains largely ignorant of the next customer to walk through their front door. RewardMe brings the CRM capabilities of eCommerce giants to offline stores, giving merchants detailed knowledge of their unique customers, and the ability to act upon this information in real time. RewardMe delivers this ""inevitable future"" of local commerce by connecting a network of devices: the Point-of-Sale System (POS), in-store interactive tablets, and consumer phones. The RewardMe Platform enables commerce solutions like card-less loyalty, detailed customer analytics, eReceipts, surveys and feedback programs, intelligent mobile marketing, as well as vertical-specific applications that support the offline space. The goal of this disruptive technology is to resuscitate the art of high-touch sales – where it has been lost and where it was never previously economical – boosting revenues along the way. In the process, RewardMe is creating the world’s largest database of sales-specific Personal Identifying Information (PII). While Google became hugely successful by monetizing the context of consumer search – what consumers seek – RewardMe hopes to monetize the context of consumer sales history – what they actually buy.","Advertising, Commerce and Shopping, Information Technology, Mobile, Sales and Marketing, Software",3,"Jun Loayza, Stephen Johnson, Yu-kai Chou",11-50,1,Seed,1100000,USD,1100000,1100000,USD,1100000,"Telenav, MI Ventures, D.J Martin",,3,,Private,,,,,,

The BabyPlus:registered: Prenatal Education System is the only patented curriculum of its kind on the market today.   How BabyPlus:registered: Works: BabyPlus:registered: introduces a safe, simple set of sounds to a child as early as 18 weeks in the womb.    These sounds are patterned after the mother’s heartbeat, the one language the baby can recognize at this very stage of life because it’s the only true and consistent sound of the prenatal environment.  The variation of sounds stimulates the baby’s cognitive development and as the child progresses through the BabyPlus:registered: curriculum, he or she learns to discriminate between those sounds.  In other words, auditory learning begins. Most importantly, it begins during a stage that will have the most enduring benefits for the child. The developmental benefits of BabyPlus truly last a lifetime.   The BabyPlus:registered: curriculum is made up of 16 lessons that can be started anytime between 18 and 32 weeks.  The prenatal education system is designed for the mother to wear twice a day; an hour in the morning and an hour in the evening, starting with lesson one and progressing through the lessons slowly over the course of the pregnancy.  This auditory exercise strengthens learning ability during the developmental period when the advantages will be most significant for a child.  Much like a prenatal vitamin encourages strong physical development, BabyPlus:registered: encourages strong cognitive development. BabyPlus:registered: - From Hollywood and Beyond: BabyPlus:registered: is becoming a must-have pregnancy item for many celebrities. Gwen Stefani used BabyPlus:registered: while pregnant with her son, Kingston and she has recommended it to friends like Boris Kodjoe and his wife Nicole Ari Parker, who used it during their second pregnancy.  New mom Nicole Richie picked up her BabyPlus:registered: system at Destination Maternity and used it during her pregnancy with Harlow.  Nicole and father Joel Madden continuously report in the media a laid back, calm baby.  Melissa Joan Hart used the system during her pregnancy. The original Bachelorette Trista Sutter used BabyPlus:registered:, as well as actress and new mom Ali Landry, among many others BabyPlus:registered: Partners BabyPlus:registered: is continually developing strong partnerships within the industry and reaching more expectant mothers around the world every day. BabyPlus:registered: is available on line at BabyPlus.com as well as on the web at the Johnson & Johnson site, Diapers.com, Target.com, Amazon.com, Babies R Us.com and most recently at Barnes & Noble.com.
