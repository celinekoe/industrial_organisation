The summarization and segmentation of this valuable transaction data is critically important to their clients as they segment their customer list for marketing campaigns, cross-sell, and up-sell opportunities. StoneTimberRiver’s clients are more commonly retaining their rights to television and radio media assets. Although their clients are not media outlets in their own right, they are frequently faced with the burdensome task of creating broadcast logs and affidavits for the media assets included in their corporate partnership agreements. As an alternative to six-figure traffic management solutions designed for television and radio stations, StoneTimberRiver created their MediaLine product to address the unique broadcast traffic needs of their professional sports team clients. These clients are typically creating logs and affidavits for the TV and radio game broadcast, the coaches show, the Spanish-language broadcast, and perhaps other ancillary programming. MediaLine utilizes a drag-and-drop color-coded interface that syncs to their Corporate Partnership Modules in CRM on demand. Broadcast logs and affidavits can be created for programming in a matter of minutes.","Information Technology, Sales and Marketing, Software",,,1-10,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
