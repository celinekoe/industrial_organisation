Affiliate companies include Questar Gas, a natural gas utility serving nearly a million homes and businesses in Utah, Wyoming and Idaho; Questar Pipeline an interstate pipeline company; and Wexpro a natural gas developer in the region. Prior to creating Questar Fueling, Questar Gas, the utility, first experimented with NGVs in 1981 when it converted 25 fleet vehicles and built a compressor station for fueling. For seven years, the company tested parts, made adjustments and improved the vehicle conversions and fueling process. By 1989, 21 of the original 25 vehicles were still on the road, a second station was installed, and Ford and General Motors began testing other vehicle models with the utility. The public also started showing interest, so the utility provided full public access to its two NGV-fueling stations. NGV MapBy the mid '90s, Questar's NGV fleet grew to more than 700 vehicles and the company moved NGV-fueling stations from its service centers to locations where the public and company could conveniently refuel. Ideally, this meant finding locations with branded gasoline stations where the owners would allow Questar Gas to lease space for the NGV-fueling equipment. Now Questar Gas operates 28 public NGV stations and has assisted the state in building five semi-public NGV stations, creating Utah's well-known Interstate-15 NGV-fueling corridor. In addition, the company has assisted many of its business-class customers with fleets install stations at their own facilities to fuel their NGVs. We have learned a few things about NGV fueling over the past 30 years and now we're offering our experience and services through Questar Fueling.","Energy, Natural Resources, Sustainability",,,,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

LoanKrunch is true loan comparison engine, which places the consumer — not the loan officer, in control of the loan shopping process. The LoanKrunch patent pending expert rules engine compiles hundreds of rates and programs from multiple lenders daily, so the consumer can see all of the loan possibilities, including wholesale rates.  This completely transparent process can be done anonymously — no SSN, first name or last name needed. Searching takes seconds, and intuitive tools put the consumer in control, and gives them an easy way to filter, sort, and compare your options. Interested in a 30 year fixed term? A lower monthly payment?  Buy down the interest rate?  Once the consumer has found the appropriate loan — the LoanKrunch application process uses bank level data security to process your application through their lender partners — making it safe and secure.  And, when the consumer closes their loan, they'll get additional savings (on top of wholesale rates) with flat fee pricing—which can add up to a 50–90% savings vs. a traditional loan process. Securing a home loan is a serious and complicated financial decision, but LoanKrunch helps make it easier for consumers by providing an upfront way to see all available loan options and strategies anytime—all at an affordable price.","Financial Services, Other",2,"David E Chin, John Wang",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
