Entrepreneurship is a critical part of a sound economic development strategy since communities that wish to create jobs and wealth must have a healthy supply of home-grown entrepreneurial companies.  Therefore, with the publication of the 1996 Growing Success: A Report on Entrepreneurship in Louisville, the report called for the formation of the ENTERPRISECORP.  The intent was for the ENTERPRISECORP to be the focal point for the community’s entrepreneurial development effort.  It called for the ENTERPRISECORP to create a new culture of entrepreneurship in Louisville and to increase dramatically the number and quality of entrepreneurial companies in Louisville.  The Report also indicated the consolidation and coordination of existing entrepreneurial support programs, the launch of significant new programs, and becoming a virtual incubator and champion for the cause of entrepreneurship. And so in 1999, the ENTERPRISECORP was formed.  Today we are the entrepreneurial arm of Greater Louisville Inc. – the metro chamber of commerce -- supported by our partners and board of advisors, and serving a community of early stage and fast growth businesses with the pursuit that Greater Louisville becomes a more prosperous, dynamic and resilient region.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

From a hub in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, this San Francisco team is augmented by the experience of open source developers who have participated in the world's largest regional migration to free software. Beginning with Brazilian President ""Lula"" da Silva's decree to migrate all public agencies and state-owned firms to free software, a wave of open source adoption has swept across Latin America: from Brazil to Ecuador to Argentina to Venezuela to Paraguay, governments across the region have made a deliberate and aggressive migration to open source technologies, with incredible success. North by South's experience in this process, combined with their management team's experience in San Francisco's dot-com booms, has positioned NXS as a company able to provide planning & implementation for businesses who want to leverage the advantages of open source technology in their organizations. The cost reduction provided by free software solutions is combined with North by South's ability to give businesses access to a Developers Network of Latin American technologists who make it possible for NXS to offer competitive implementation pricing. NXS is one of the first companies to provide near-shoring to Latin America. Aside from free software expertise, the NXS team has experience in designing applications built for scalability, peer-initiated user acquisition, e-mail deliverability and the latest in AJAX/Javascript web applications.","Design, Media and Entertainment, Mobile, Platforms, Software",,,11-50,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,LaunchCapital,,1,,Private,,,,,,
