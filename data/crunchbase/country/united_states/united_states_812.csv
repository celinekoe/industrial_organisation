Each friend writes their greetings and contributes toward the goal amount.  Once the GIVTCARD is delivered, the recipient transfers the collected amount to his/her bank account to buy his/her dream gift. The experience continues when the recipient shares the gift story with his/her friends. We believe in the power of small communities to do away with wasted gifts.
