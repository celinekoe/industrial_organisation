Offering first-class service, excellent playing conditions and challenging layouts, New Era Golf Clubs are always on the top of the list for players in the region.  With the recent addition of New Albany Links to their portfolio, New Era has proven they are a top golf course management firm and now offer an even better value to its members and daily-fee guests. When you visit a New Era Golf Facility you immediately know the management is there to provide the golfers with a great time from the golf course to the pro shop to the grille room.  Between all the club managers and golf professionals, New Era boasts over 250 years of golf course management experience.  Led by PGA member and managing partner, Ray Finnearty takes pride in knowing the members by name and is a usual sight around the clubs.  ""I am very proud to bring together four of the top clubs in the Columbus area.  Our goal is to offer the best value and experience around and I think we're doing a good job so far.  However, we will continue to improve in all areas of our operations and look forward to a great 2014"" says Finnearty. New Albany Links was added to the New Era Golf Portfolio in early January bringing the course count to four clubs.  ""We have big plans for New Albany. Our immediate goal is to soften the golf course to improve the playability for golfers of all skill levels.  We will cut back the Heather Grass, remove some of the bunkers that are not in play, and widen some of the landing areas over time.   This will drastically improve the pace of play.  This is a phenomenal golf course.   ""These improvements are designed to make New Albany Links more player-friendly while preserving the design of the architect"" indicates Michael J. Emigh, New Era's Director of Membership. Although the New Era Membership Product improved with this addition, the cost of the membership stayed the same.  Now all New Era Members have the opportunity to play at New Albany Links, Glenross Golf Club, Royal American Links and Bent Tree Golf Club.  Each club offers a unique challenge although excellent course conditions and service will be a standard throughout the portfolio.","Commerce and Shopping, Sports",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

For those who want to search: No need to endlessly trawl the Internet or to drive around hunting for that honest second generation roofer or mason with barely any digital presence, that hard-to-find garage or bake sale, that grassroots municipal referendum, that weekend meditation class by the river, that impromptu outdoor concert or farmers market, or that walkathon for your favorite charity. With YardSignGPS, we make such invaluable word-of-mouth information conveniently searchable: simply tap on a yard sign icon, and you’ll be instantly directed to a current photo of a local event, service, sale, or grassroots cause. For those who want to be found: No need to spend time and money on complex websites that few will see, fragmented social networks that generate no leads and violate your privacy, tiny advertising spots in print newspapers that no one reads, and paid search engine keyword algorithms that you probably do not understand. With YardSignGPS, the interface is much simpler and more transparent: take a picture of your public announcement (yard sign, poster, flyer, etc.), stake it on the map, and then let people contact you directly.","Commerce and Shopping, Data and Analytics, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Mobile, Navigation and Mapping, Travel and Tourism",2,"Fanny Moinel D'Onofrio, Mark D'Onofrio",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

A car that reaches the end of its lifecycle does not mean that it has to be old. In fact, many vehicles reach this limit early on because the engine blows up or the vehicle is involved in a serious accident that totals the vehicle. These things happen and when they do, you may be left with a vehicle that never drives again. Instead of letting this vehicle sit in your driveway or in your yard, you should call the team at We Buy Junk Cars Naranja. We provide all residents with the most cash for junk cars in Naranja. We want to purchase your vehicle from you, even if it is damaged. Our technicians will even pay you CASH on the spot. When you choose to hire our professionals, you will have nothing to worry about. We work honestly and our team is reliable, so you can always expect us to show up when we say we will and we will always provide you with the quoted cash price. We do NOT charge you hidden fees or deduct ridiculous expenses from the amount you are due to receive. While you no longer what your vehicle, you may be interested in where it goes and what happens to it once we buy it from you. Since your vehicle will never be on the road again, we recycle it. The process starts with us removing any of the usable parts that may still be in the vehicle from the seats to the radio faceplate, and more. From there, we will remove any hazardous chemicals and fluids from your vehicle. We follow ALL state, local, and federal regulations to ensure there is no pollution or harm done to the environment.
