They have over 75,000 users in over 40 countries worldwide. WSG is proud of the quality of their offerings, customer support and product capabilities. Their enterprise software, Empire SUITE, is designed for growing, dynamic companies. A key difference between the Empire SUITE and competitive products is the ease and speed of deployment. In fact, two of the critical factors in a competitive win were the significantly shorter implementation time frame and lower implementation costs for their solution compared to the other tools under consideration. Another major differentiator of the Empire SUITE is that once you have configured the software to meet your needs, any future changes in business requirements will not make your investment obsolete. Some software companies use “scalability” as the ability to accommodate an increasing number of users. They use scalability to mean both accommodating user growth and that the Empire SUITE will grow with the organization functionally to meet evolving business challenges.","Financial Services, Professional Services, Software",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
