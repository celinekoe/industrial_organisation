GFF has invested millions of dollars, as well as countless hours of human capital, in improving the life of communities throughout this African country. The Foundation was co-founded in 2004 by Dan Gertler, Senior Advisor to the Fleurette Group. Today, GFF’s achievements can be seen in Maniema, Kasai-Oriental, Kinshasha, Sud Kivu and Katanga among other provinces of the DRC, in the form of new homes, schools, health clinics and hospitals, roads, electric and water infrastructure and farming cooperatives. Focused on the most vulnerable populations, the Foundation develops the country’s remote and poor areas, where there is limited or no access to basic facilities and services. Following Dan Gertler's vision, building a brighter futures for the Congolese people is of paramount importance. Programs GFF’s projects are community-based, and concentrate on local empowerment and sustainability. The organization forms coalitions with local NGOs, governmental bodies, and international organizations, in order to build structures that maximize community impact and outlast GFF’s direct involvement. Its program priorities are: o Education: providing school buildings, curriculum materials, scholarships for college and university studies, and housing for orphans and other at-risk children. o Healthcare: establishing new rural clinics and hospitals, and programs that address the DRC’s most pressing medical issues, such as malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, facial deformities, HIV-AIDS and other diseases endemic to the country. o Development of Infrastructure: building and repairing houses, roads, transportation centers, airports, utilities, and water systems. o Agriculture: supporting and establishing farming cooperatives and fish farms. o Culture: supporting sport, music, and cultural programs that will fill the DRC’s people with pride – especially in the more impoverished communities, where it is easy to fall into despair. o Emergency Assistance: being among the first to respond to national emergencies, and coordinating with partner agencies to provide food, shelter, clothing, medicine and other necessities to those suffering from extreme hardship due to natural disasters.","Other, Social Impact",1,Dan Gertler,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

On leaving the facility, the process provides the retailer, or tank owner, with video validation that contamination does not exist in the tank. The company offers retailer driven advertising and operational management from the gathered monitoring data. The income generated for GreenFuelsUSA come from monthly and service related fees.

These assemblies supported his ambition of launching exciting new products into the world using his proprietary embedded firmware. By 2001, the notion of having a manufacturing facility owned and operated by a real design engineer took off, and the company was incorporated and moved to an industrial complex in Moorpark.  After the move, Laritech started offering the same exceptional product launch support to not just Bill, but to all customers who had a need. Customers using this service became so successful that an additional building was added in 2010 for full ISO/ITAR production of complete assemblies including mechanical and packaging. An explosive growth spurt followed and Laritech was named to the INC5000 fastest growing companies in America an impressive 6 times. Today, the Laritech campus covers 30,000 square feet in 4 separate buildings and employs close to 100 hardworking Americans. They have launched over new 400 products in almost every conceivable market. With a dedicated design and separate dedicated production facility on campus, you can be assured your product will receive the correct attention no matter what phase it is in.
