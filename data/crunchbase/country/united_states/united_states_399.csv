Augi™ uses barcode, QRcode, OCR and image recognition to continuously recognize millions of products with seamless transition between product packaging and barcodes all within a live camera view. Additionally, Augi™ utilizes continuous Scan, OCR and Geospatial technology developed by Alphabet (Google Goggles) and IBM. The CERTIFIED Visual Search Technology Team employs this technology to identify and proprietarily analyze products in real-time while simultaneously providing relative information on consumer shopping habits worldwide. CERTIFIED’s Augi™ technology enhances the consumer shopping experience using visual information for search and discovery of products. CERTIFIED designed an Augmented Reality Solution for mobile devices by overlaying relevant information over camera-phone views of the products themselves. Augi™ was initially built to specifically recognize CERTIFIED’s unique Seals as well as the individual objects in smartphone views. However, the technology was expanded to support barcode and QR code recognition on mobile devices for universal application.   Through Augi™, customers gain access to relevant product information for millions of packaged household items such as a box of cereal, milk, toothpaste or other grocery items. Augi™ technology has the capability to track a fisherman’s catch or a farmer’s harvest straight to your table!  This cutting-edge technological advancement is the direct replacement for the invalidated Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) system for beef, pork and chicken in the United States. Augi™ can even notify you if there’s been a product recall as well as provide any emergency health or safety issues specifically related to the product or its ingredients.  For manufacturers and producers, providing consumers the best information about products helps SELL products. Shopping habits can be tracked worldwide which would save marketers millions in researching the decisions on HOW to market a product, WHERE to market the product and TO WHOM the product should be marketed to. For more information on how to leverage this exciting new technology on your products, please contact CERTIFIED, INC.

Mr. Lisak is a registered Environmental Health Specialist and a nationally recognized Specialist in hazardous materials. That background and proficiency with all the latest technologies has made him a highly demanded specialist internationally, being called to Eastern Europe and Indonesia to assist groups with hazardous waste and other environmental issues. He has long been involved in alternative energy, and is the former CEO of JPL Environmental, Inc.

Mr. Lisak can boast over 31 years of direct Environmental and Hazardous Waste/Materials Programs management dating back to 1973. In 1984 he joined the Hazardous Materials Division of the County of Los Angeles and by the time he retired in 2002, he was the Hazardous Materials Control Manager. Prior to 1984, Mr. Lisak managed the LA County Public Health Laboratory (including Environmental Lab). As a Hazardous Materials Specialist Control Manager, he was responsible for the licensing/permitting and inspecting of 18,700 facilities, including numerous industries involving waste to energy, solar, wind, geothermal, site remediations, and emergency responses to hazardous substance releases. His responsibilities also included teaching all personnel in all the diagnostic testing technologies created to test for the presence of any harmful pathogens or toxic substances.  During that time, he helped write a number of current laws while working closely with Federal, State, County, and City agencies throughout the United States and Mexico. In addition to his County experience, Mr. Lisak was an Assistant/Associate Professor and taught classes at the California State Universities located in Northridge and Fullerton, and at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA). He was chosen by the United States Agency of International Development (USAID) to develop the curriculum for environmental study for eleven universities in Indonesia. He has also lectured at the University of Southern California and several junior colleges.
