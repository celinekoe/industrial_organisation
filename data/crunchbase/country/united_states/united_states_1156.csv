(EMI) a New England based energy company with 35 years of experience in energy conservation and energy development. ESS Group, Inc. of Waltham, Massachusetts, has been the environmental science specialist for the project. Cape Wind is also being assisted by Woods Hole Group, K2 Management, SgurrEnergy, AWS Truepower, and PMSS. Barclays is Cape Wind’s Financial Advisor.  In 1975, Energy Management, Inc. (EMI) began developing energy conservation and pollution control projects for institutional and industrial facilities. In 1985, the company transitioned to developing independent power projects. The company has successfully developed six natural gas fired electric generation projects. Over the past thirty-five years EMI earned a reputation of completing environmentally superior facilities with ultra-high plant availability. Since 2001, EMI has been focused primarily on developing renewable energy projects including offshore wind, biomass, and solar.  Cape Wind will produce 75% of the electricity used on Cape Cod and the Islands of Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket in average conditions, with zero pollutant emissions, zero waste discharge, and zero water consumption.  Cape Wind will help launch the American offshore wind industry and produce significant economic, environmental, and energy benefits for Massachusetts, the region, and the nation.  Cape Wind will consist of 130 Siemens 3.6-megawatt offshore wind turbines with a capacity of 468 megawatts.  The project will be located in Federal waters off the coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, on Horseshoe Shoal in Nantucket Sound, the most technically optimal offshore wind power site in the United States.  Cape Wind’s monopile foundations are individually designed and will be driven deep into the seabed to support the wind turbines.  Transition pieces will be fitted onto the monopiles.  The wind turbine towers will be bolted onto the transition pieces.  Intra array submarine cables will be jet plowed six feet into the seabed and will feed into an Electric Service Platform (ESP) near the center of the wind farm array.  From the ESP, export submarine cables will be submerged and make landfall in West Yarmouth, where buried cables will continue to the interconnect point, the Barnstable Substation.  Cape Wind’s Operations Headquarters will be based along Falmouth Harbor on Cape Cod.  Horseshoe Shoal in Nantucket Sound has all of the characteristics to be the optimal location for America’s first offshore wind farm.  This location also makes good sense thinking about both the past and the future of the Cape and Islands.  Not only do the Cape and Islands have a rich history of harnessing wind power, but they now stand to benefit by being a leader in clean energy production to mitigate the impacts of climate change, to which the Cape and Islands are particularly vulnerable.","Energy, Natural Resources, Sustainability",1,Jim Gordon,11-50,3,,,,,1200000000,USD,1200000000,"Rabobank, Natixis, Mitsubishi UFJ, EKF, Danish Pension Fund",1,5,,Private,,,,,,

The founding of LEYE was the result of joining Melman's food ideas with the confidence and support of Jerry A. Orzoff, Melman's first partner. A successful real estate agent and North Michigan Avenue haberdasher, Orzoff (who died in 1981 at the age of 45), played a crucial role in Melman's life as a friend and mentor. ""Jerry was a guy I respected and related to,"" says Melman. ""He believed in my ideas. Meeting him was the turning point in my life."" After meeting Melman for the first time in 1970, Orzoff liked his off-beat ideas, and believed in his ability. Working together as new friends and partners, Melman and Orzoff raised a total of $17,000 to create an upbeat eatery geared toward young singles interested in rock music, casual clothes and healthy food. Melman hired bright, attractive waitresses and bartenders and filled the location with hanging plants and modern artwork. The menu was designed to appeal to a variety of tastes, and included everything from vegetarian and macrobiotic foods to hamburgers, sandwiches, milkshakes and the first fruit and vegetable-laden salad bar. Melman and Orzoff paired their first initials, added the sound a pig makes when eating and baptized the establishment R.J. Grunts on June 10, 1971 in Chicago's Lincoln Park. Despite a lackluster response in the opening weeks, Orzoff provided the much needed confidence and enthusiasm to keep Melman optimistic until his dream became reality.

The aerodynamic sleek flowing lines make it the most striking of land or sea planes.  We have developed the world’s best and fastest 4/5 place amphibian. The spacious cabin, panoramic view, quiet environment, and form-fitting seats all combine to create total traveling comfort.  Since the dawn of aviation, designers have been trying to create a seaplane that would fly as fast and as far as a land plane and carry a reasonable useful load over a long distance.  Using advanced composite technology and innovative design, Seawind has accomplished that lofty goal. High speed stability is superb.  The standard slotted flaps and the swept back wingtip floats (sponsons) create an extraordinary ground effect, cushions the touchdown, and speeds the lift-off on water and land.  Low speed stability is excellent.  Never before has an amphibian offered so much comfort.  The Seawind has the widest cabin in its class, with the standard executive deluxe four-place configuration or the optional family five-place seating.  The seats are bucket-style adjustable with temper foam for ultimate comfort.  The special designed seats have passed the stringent 26g forward and 19g - 60°up vertical crash tests. The wrap-around windshield offers a spectacular panoramic view even for the aft seats. Whether the mission is a business meeting in the city or a fishing trip into the wilderness, or cross country travel, the Seawind fills the bill.  The Seawind is the only plane that fulfills every customer’s needs.","Manufacturing, Science and Engineering, Transportation, Travel and Tourism",,,11-50,1,,500000,USD,500000,500000,USD,500000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Patients do not have access to the latest unbiased medical information and ongoing research about their disease or condition. This information is traditionally published in medical research journals – an expensive and exclusive resource to which most do not have access. At the same time, information that patients find online or hear about in the news is often misleading or only a “half truth.” The problem is only getting worse as medical research is ongoing in most areas of health care and the amount of medical knowledge continues to pile up! It can be difficult even for physicians and health professionals to keep up, not to mention the patients with no medical training who simply want to know what is going on with their body and what they can do to stay healthy. Our Solution: We created MD Lingo with one goal in mind – to provide our patients with reliable, up to date information on the latest medical research. We imagine being able to go to one site and looking up ANY condition or disease and finding all the latest literature on new medicines, new therapies, new treatments and new discoveries. All based on real facts and real science – but made clear and easy to understand! This is accomplished by taking the latest medical studies and “translating” them into everyday English. We envision a full directory of the same journals doctors read but presented without the medical gibberish, boiled down to its main points and how they affect you! Not only does MD Lingo give you full access to these previously unattainable resources, we also attempt to break down the studies, letting you know which ones were done well (and are backed by evidence) vs those that you should be more skeptical about. Furthermore, while the FDA approval process for new medications can often be long and confusing, we hope to demystify it by not only explaining how it works but also informing patients how far a particular therapy is from being approved. MD Lingo is a crew of over 50 writers and 10 editors who are top medical students from around the country. Our students are are driven and intellectually curious. Each day they read studies and learn about new developments in medicine. They are trained at interpreting the results and communicating the information with clarity to our audience of readers.Each writer has, at minimum, a bachelor’s degree in a scientific/technical field of study. A few even have graduate degrees as well or are pursuing additional doctorate or master’s degrees in addition to their medical school pursuits. These writers all believe in the mission of MD Lingo and the goal of patient education.","Health Care, Information Technology",2,"Deep Parikh, Vladimir Ornstein",11-50,1,,,,,428000,USD,428000,,,,,Private,,,,,,
