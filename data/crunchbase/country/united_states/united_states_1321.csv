For years, writers have joined the Red Room Writers Society to get their writing done in a supportive environment. Most people don't need more instruction; they need to write. The Red Room Writers Society is the only writers society or school focused on writing rather than focused on reading and talking. Founded in June 2002 by Ivory Madison, the Red Room Writers Society began providing its innovative, signature Writers Studios to procrastinating professional and aspiring writers in the San Francisco Bay Area. It was an immediate success. Founded on just $150, and a lot of volunteer support, it provided numerous scholarships for writers who could not otherwise afford the program, as well as numerous donations to silent auctions and community programs. At the same time, it made writers feel special, giving them an inspiring and luxurious environment in the formal dining room of a 1904 mansion. The Red Room Writers Society was recognized by San Francisco magazine in its Best of the Bay 2005.The company has been profiled in the media as a major feature story in statewide publications such as California Lawyer magazine,and in national book industry magazines such as Pages.The company and its founder are deeply entrenched in the San Francisco literary scene. Madison has served on the board of and been a featured writer at Litquake, the city's premiere annual literary festival. The Red Room Writers Society is featured in the citywide Literary Map of San Francisco. While the Red Room Writers Society began with just four members, it now has served more than four hundred talented writers in San Francisco, and appeared in the acknowledgements of published books, by authors who mention that they never would have finished their manuscripts without the Red Room Writers Society. The ""brick and mortar"" Red Room worked with as many writers as possible through its Writers Studios, workshops, and coaching and editing services, until going on hiatus in August 2008, so that Madison could focus on reaching an even wider community, worldwide.  The internet is the perfect vehicle to connect writers, rich or poor, published or unpublished, to the support and resources they need to make their dreams come true, and so Madison founded redroom.com, which launched to the public in January 2008.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Today, that goal is a reality. Premium Standard Farms is one of the largest pork producers in the country with roughly 212,000 sows in production in Missouri, North Carolina and Texas, and a state of the art processing facility in Milan, Mo., and Clinton, N.C. The company was the first in the industry to pursue full vertical integration. On December 21, 1989 the first Premium Standard Farms litter of seven gilts and four barrows was born at 7:00 a.m. on the Wiles Farm just outside Princeton, Missouri. By 1991, investment partners were in place, and the company began to grow rapidly, completing construction on production units for 80,000 sows and a processing plant by September of 1994.  The company also began expansion in Texas in 1994, acquiring the former National Hog Farms of Texas in June of that year. Additional growth and expansion in Texas was underway in 1995 when the commodity markets experienced unprecedented volatility, forcing a change in strategy and a capital restructuring. By 1996 with the restructuring complete, the Company was on the road to becoming a leader in the industry. In May 1998, Premium Standard Farms merged with Continental Grain Company's (now ContiGroup Companies, Inc.) north Missouri swine operation adding an additional 25,000 sows of production to the existing 80,000 sow Missouri herd. This merger added to the Company's strength, and set the stage for the future. On June 30, 2000 Premium Standard Farms signed an agreement with the Lundy Packing Company to purchase its processing and production operations. It was also announced that Premium Standard Farms would purchase Contigroup's Carolina Farms operations. By August 25, the purchase was complete and both groups are now part of the Premium Standard Farms team. Premium Standard Farms is recognized as an industry leader in food safety, environmental stewardship and worker safety. The company's commitment to quality was recognized in December 1998 when Premium Standard Farms became the first pork producer/processor to earn Process Verified (PVP) accreditation from the United States Department of Agriculture. Today, Premium Standard Farms markets consistent high quality pork to discriminating domestic retailers, further processors, food service providers and export customers in more than 20 countries around the world.",Food and Beverage,,,1-10,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

In 2014, Big Five  was recognized  by Virtuoso, an international luxury travel network, with the award for 2014 Sustainable Tourism Leadership. We received Conde Nast Traveler’s World Savers Award in 2013.  Big Five is also a member of The Global Partnership for Sustainable Tourism Criteria (GSTC Partnership) which works to foster increased understanding of sustainable tourism principles and practices. Big Five has a sustainable vision that encompasses working with companies, accommodations and suppliers who share our corporate philosophy of responsible tourism.  In East Africa, for example, Kenya has for generations been ‘the’ safari destination.  We have all heard about or witnessed scenes of a dozen vehicles surrounding one lion trying to catch a nap.  How do we balance the needs of animals, local communities and visitors?  Each segment is vital to the future survival of the animals, cultures and ecosystems of Africa. We believe that part of the answer can be found in private conservancies such as the Selenkay Conservancy, adjacent to Kenya’s Amboseli National Park. This 15,000-acre private game reserve in the heart of Maasailand admits only 18 visitors per day.  It is one of a growing number of conservancies leading the way in habitat conservation as one of the best solutions to help save Africa’s wild places and the animals that inhabit them for the future generations. We also promote and support destinations such as Namibia, which has sustainability written into its constitution, and Costa Rica, which aims to be the first carbon neutral nation. Big Five Tours & Expeditions’ nonprofit Spirit of Big Five Foundation is dedicated to Supporting Sustainable Tourism for a Better Tomorrow.  www.spiritofbigfive.org Formally launched in 2007 as a 501 3c nonprofit organization, the Spirit of Big Five Foundation seeks to broaden the scope and depth of support to conservation, poverty alleviation, education and healthcare in Africa, Asia, and Central and South America. The foundation grew out of the guiding philosophy of Big Five Tours & Expeditions, a leading luxury tour operator. It is a continuation and evolution of our commitment to responsible travel that harks back to its origin of Big Five in Nairobi, Kenya. The founder and CEO, Mahen Sanghrajka, became part of a group  of tour operators who established some a code of ethics for safaris such as prohibiting smoking while on safaris, and forbidding guides and drivers to harass the wildlife.  Today those ideas seems obvious, however, in early 1970s in East Africa, they were not. The operation of the Spirit of Big Five Foundation is entirely funded by the Sanghrajka family, the founders of Big Five Tours & Expeditions.  But many of our guests returning home from their journeys are also inspired to be part of the solution.  We welcome guest donations, and the foundation guarantees that 100% of any donation made goes directly to project(s) selected. We support select projects and programs around the world, demonstrating how tourism can play a positive role in protecting nature and sustaining the well-being of local communities. Foundation funding for projects operates in two ways. First, it makes direct donations to charitable organizations, including humanitarian assistance during natural disaster, such as the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti. Secondly, it also disperses small project grants to grassroots non-profit organizations that meet its funding criteria. Primary goals of the Spirit of Big Five Foundation are:     Conservation and protection of biodiversity, wildlife and natural habitat consistent with sustainable tourism practices.     Support for poverty alleviation and community development, including capacity building, education, and healthcare in tourism destinations.     Support for cultural heritage, archaeological and historical preservation in and around tourism destinations.

Wrisco’s history traces its origins back to 1916 when the Company was founded as The Guarantee Specialty Manufacturing Company.  From its inception, the Company offered diverse product lines, including uniform fasteners, small washers, specialty stampings, sink strainers, caulking guns and venetian blind components. Over the next forty years, The Guarantee Specialty Manufacturing Company expanded into eleven separate corporations whose products included specialty metal products and various types of extrusions for both the architectural and signage industries along with one-inch and two-inch venetian blind components. During the mid-1970s, these eleven corporations merged under one corporation, RHW, Inc. and were organized into divisions rather than individual companies.  In 1981, RHW, Inc. divested itself of the manufacturing group.  One year later, two of its executives, A. James Monastra and Carl A. Pope, purchased the remaining Wrisco divisions through a holding company, Royalton Products Corporation.  In December 1986, the holding company and operating company were merged into a single entity which maintained the name of the former operating subsidiary, Wrisco Industries Inc. In late 1987, the Corporate Offices were moved from North Royalton, Ohio to its present location in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. In 1992, Carl A. Pope retired and A. James Monastra became sole owner and consolidated Wrisco into the four divisions that operate at present – Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and Edison, NJ. Joining A. James Monastra as owners in 2006, is the current team of Jim Monastra President, Roman Bender Vice President and Richard Young Vice President. For more than 100 years, as the industry leader, Wrisco’s mission has been to supply its customers with unmatched quality aluminum products and superior services.   By providing Wrisco’s employees a safe, enjoyable and rewarding workplace, Wrisco constantly meets and surpasses their customer’s expectations. Their sincere gratitude to all that have contributed to Wrisco’s success – past, present and future!","Manufacturing, Science and Engineering",,,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Since then, the business has grown up. They are still creating great menus served throughout the streets of Seattle from the Airstream. But Skillet is now much more than that.

The thread is still there: great food prepared with care, technique and the best of ingredients; an innovative experience that consistently surprises and satisfies; and a feeling of being personally connected to Skillet, in all its manifestations.
