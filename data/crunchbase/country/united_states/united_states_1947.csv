One goal of the site is to connect lawyers to new technologies in hopes of making the practice of law easier — both inside and outside of the courtroom.  After attending a program at a lawyer's conference entitled: ""60 Hot Legal Tech Tips, Gadgets, and Websites in 60 Minutes,"" Rex knew there was a need for a place for lawyers to talk about new technology with each other.  Out of the 60 items, Rex either knew all of them already or they were of no use!  The panelists at the forum knew more about technology than they were letting on, but they taught to an audience unfamiliar with many technologies.  There needed to be a place where attorneys could go to get updates on the latest technological information; the one-hour session was too much technology in too short a time. ""I am not talking about creating lawyers who walk around with a mini-computer in one hand and an iPhone in the other.  Lawyers need to utilize new technologies to become more effective storytellers in the courtroom, better communicators with clients and other attorneys, and better promote the legal profession.  To be an effective lawyer today, it would almost be malpractice to not take advantage some of the new technologies available.  Our clients demand and deserve better."" As an advocate of social media use by lawyers, Rex hopes to start the conversation, to teach, and learn.  The whole purpose of social media is to build communities and share information.  Together, as a profession, the legal community might learn something.  Another goal is to share information about the practice of law, discuss, debate, and hopefully demystify some of the myths about those in the legal profession.","Government and Military, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Privacy and Security, Professional Services",1,Rex Gradeless,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The Pearlo software will be a cloud-based, no code solution for process improvement. Small business owners are focused on moving very far as quickly as they can to achieve growth. To sustain this growth, the firms must continually improve their processes and find better ways of doing business. This quest for continuous process improvement and increased organizational efficiency would be much easier if the business users could simply narrate the way they currently perform a process or standard operating procedure. From there the tool will be able to transform that narrative using NLP technology into a process flow diagram and then give the process a score and a set of recommendations for improvement using ML/DL/decision tree and other relevant AI technology.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Other, Science and Engineering, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
