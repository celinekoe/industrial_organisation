Each and every day, there are planned events and emergency situations, where communication is essential. Likewise, each and every day, Sign Shares expertise is there, ready to respond.  In 1986, before the Americans with Disabilities Act was signed into law, Sign Shares began providing sign language and oral interpreting services. At the time, service providers were singularly focused on deafness, providing a social service. People were identified by their “dis-ability” and sought to “refer” rather than focus responsibly on objectives.  Sign Shares expanded the scope of service, looking at activities of daily living. They continue to pioneer, entering fields of study and industry never before served.  Over 20 years, Sign Shares has continuously met an increasing demand, accommodating a myriad of clientele and consumers in every walk of life. Sign Shares has the ability to provide qualified personnel to fill virtually every client request, no matter the nature of the assignment or advance notice, despite well documented shortages nationwide. Their dependability has been exceptional as our business plan anticipates service needs and technology well into the future. Not only do they identify existing resources, they monitor developing resources, further training interpreters in specific language and protocol of client entities, monitoring the advancement and cost of new technologies, while managing payables, receivables and expenditures as conservatively as possible.  ""Heartbeat Of America"" Television Show. Click to play.  Sign Shares provides communication services to those in top levels of government and industry, highly secure and technical in nature, they provide services to those in the mainstream as well as to those who have been less fortunate and those who may have limited formal language. Their pursuit of resources qualified in tri lingual (English/ASL/Spanish) interpreting, the ability to serve people whose language is Mexican Sign Language and their ability to provide Certified Deaf Interpreters, qualified Intermediaries and deaf blind interpreters, offers communication with those previously unserved or severely under served. They also have the capability to coordinate and provide services through web based and secure video conferencing technology.  Sign Shares is committed to managing day to day services responsibly, with full consideration of community, regional differences and local resources. Sign Shares Service Coordinators focus on services provided in their local communities, coordinating either Community Services which fluctuate on a daily basis or Educational services provided to faculty and students on multiple campuses. With us, it is about cost effective management of services and schedules with concern for qualification and confidentiality. Looking at service volume and qualifications needed on any given day, managing schedules, only sharing certain information with those who need to know, results in dependable, quality services when life happens, efficient and confidential, with services provided at a reasonable cost.  Sign Shares corporate office is located in Houston, Texas at 99 Detering, Suite 160 in the Finger Companies Building where Deborah Gunter, Chief Executive Officer, Randy Gunter, Chief Financial Officer and Sign Shares administrative support staff are located. In order to provide a cost effective service, all finance and administrative functions for the corporation are performed in the Houston office.  Sign Shares Seattle, registered in the State of Washington, opened in the Summer of 2005 to serve the Pacific Northwest. Diana Friesen, familiar with service providers, communities and client specific protocol, directs services provided through Sign Shares Seattle. Medical, corporate and educational clientele throughout the Pacific Northwest are enthusiastic about Sign Shares local presence. Sign Shares Seattle also contracts with the State of Washington Department of Social and Health Services for provision of services to a network of State supported agencies. They have built a network of service providers who are well educated, whose training experience and work history qualify them for specialty areas and those who perform in a responsible and professional manner. The Americans with Disabilities Act, brought about referral service entities in every community. The volume of services and the cost to society has made provision of communication access services increasingly competitive. Consumers are more savvy, they feel entitled and may or may not have “reasonable” expectations. Now, more than ever, knowing how best to provide accommodation for the success of the client with quality services to consumers, takes knowledge and experience, integrity and dependability. Sign Shares has all of that!","Education, Other",,,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The people. We believe in the near limitless potential of people, and the power that companies gain by properly motivating them. The companies that do this well are the companies that continue to rise to the top and beat out their competitors - and they do this through Operational Excellence. Historically, Operational Excellence has focused heavily on equipment and processes - however, in our experience, the equipment and processes are only as good as the people that you have running them. And the majority of companies really suck at recognizing this, as well as knowing what to do about it. That's where we come in. Our technology is meant to be the platform that companies can use to drive their Operational Excellence programs, to properly engage and motivate their teams, and ensure that their program continues to progress forward. At its core, an effective Operational Excellence program transforms the mindsets of the people and the culture of the organization.

With our current economy, it is can be tough to find a job. While people used to be able to check the classifieds or pick up an application at a local employer, these days most of the job search and application process has moved online. For many people, this is a problem because they do not know how to use the Internet. While this may seem unbelievable, that number is 60 million people in the United States alone. JobScout is pretty simple: Users take lessons, earn badges for those lessons and learn how to use simple tools to find work online. If you just want to learn or brush up on your Internet skills or need a hand finding a job, JobScout has over 30 thirty lessons and a collection of tools that will get you on your way. Nine new lessons, covering everything from using TaskRabbit to online employment tests, will be launched on January 29 along with the iOS launch. JobScout is not just for those new to the Web. There are tools on JobScout aside from the lessons that are just great additions to the job search process online. Our ""One Stop Job Shop"" lets you search for jobs, save listings, send in resumes with pre-formatted cover letters and track your progress with a job posting by noting your interview dates and times. You can also use JobScout’s fill-in-the-bank resume system, ResumeBuilder, to create your resume. By allowing JobScout users to access all of these features within the mobile app environment, the job application process can really be in the palm of a user’s hand. JobScout helps to level the playing field for people by taking the guesswork out of finding employment. It is a low-cost, self-guided education solution that is perfect for users who want to make the job search process more effective and useful for institutions who want to provide job search and education resources.","Administrative Services, Education, Internet Services, Professional Services",1,Christina Gagnier,1-10,2,,,,,800000,USD,800000,,,,,Private,,,,,,
