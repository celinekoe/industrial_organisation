Meanwhile, the Café is a place for them to sit and eat while the work is being done to their vehicle, if it’s something we can’t fixed in the same day we also can provide a room for them to stay in for the night at the Motel that is also located on the property. When their vehicle is done, the station will have all the things they need to get back on the road ASAP. Our goal for this company is offer a one-stop Travel Center with everything that travelers need such as gas, fuel, cold/hot drinks, ice, cafe, mechanic shop. We have also planned to remodel the gas station/cafe and motel along I-35 1-mile North of Hwy 20 in Williams IA. The market we have is a huge opportunity, sell both diesel and gasoline, as well as food in the restaurant attached to the gas station/Shop. The store would provide snacks, candies, alcohol and tobacco products. Also, we would provide items for auto care such as diesel additives, oil, wiper blades, antifreeze, tires, etc.  We have mapped out strategies that will help us take advantage of the available market and grow to become a major force across Iowa and many other states to come. We are set to use many marketing and sales strategies such as:  - Digital Marketing  - SEO - Referral Incentive - Email and SMS Marketing  -Distribution of Fliers etc. As of right now, it is a small truck stop struggling to make ends meet and looking to sell.  I am a cashier/ maintenance man. I pretty much do everything here except balance the checkbook. There are many guests that love my ideas and would love to see me make my dreams a reality. I get told on a daily by customers that they would love to have the restaurant back up and running. I would love to fully get the restaurant open to state and federal standards. It has all the appliances to operate the kitchen. They are a little out of date but they got the job done when I cooked in the kitchen in 2015- 2017. The property needs some repairs to get it to 100% operation. The flat top roof that covers the station, café, shop leaks and needs replaced but 95% of the building is brick and mortar. I wasn’t to say that with a little TLC this Great idea would make many lives easier for travels. The goal here is to create a safe haven for truckers and travelers.

Vores erfaringer er langt mange og det får man specielt mange ud af som låsesmed i København, der Københavner pulsen på var dag hele året rundt, det findes ingen opgave mærkelig eller svær nok for os. Vi står alle klar og kæmper med oprejst pande for at hjælpe dig med hvad end nu dit behov af låsesmed skulle være. En anden fordel med at vælge Norh, er at vi har et og samme vagtnummer til alle vores afdelinger, det vil sige elektriker, overvågning, vagt og låsesmed m.fl. på et og samme nummer.

Mange låsesmede mener at det nyeste og dyreste er det bedste og sikreste, sådan behøver det ikke altid være, nogle ganger er det rigeligt med fx en omkodning. En omkodning af lås er ikke nogen tidkrævende opgave når man kender rutinen. Det er dog en meget finmekanisk opgave når en omkodning skal ske og kan derfor kun laves af fagligt uddannede låsesmede. Ellers er noget som kan klares på mindre end en dag, eller nogle timer hvis det er akut. Hos Norh låsesmed København udarbejder vi altid tilbud uden at det behøver koste dig noget, vi bestræber altid for at gøre det så billigt og så godt som mulig for vores kunder.

Players do not get injured in the process of catching balls but rather in the process of pitching or throwing balls, shoulder rotation and arm/wrist follow through. The hingeband helps with the latter.   Serving with both power and accuracy is a big advantage in competitive tennis. The service motion is an all-body snap at the moment of impact, and an important part of it is the arm/wrist follow through. The Hingeband is an arm/wrist accessory which helps with exactly this detail, the arm/wrist follow through or tennis slap. Tennis is often called a ""game of inches""... but in reality is more a game of microns, so every detail counts.   Volleyball hitters, compared to baseball pitchers, do not benefit much from body rotation during the motion of hitting the ball with power, so they rely on their arm/wrist power. The arm/wrist follow through becomes very important. This is exactly what the Hingeband can do for you, help your hitters with the wrist follow through.   Swimming, wrist flexion is a component of the deep-catch stroke. Arm straight, palm perpendicular to the body, palm extends back before water contact, and palm flexes strongly forward while deep catching with the help of the hingeband. Develop wrist power and stroke memory using the hingeband.","Health Care, Sports",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
