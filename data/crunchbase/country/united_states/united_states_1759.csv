They wanted their users to be connected to those that share similar interests. They wanted to consider the value of their time and location. Whether it was for a study group, campus related activities, private parties or events or a simple book club. Through these focus groups, they cultivated and refined the general need for their mobile app. Once the idea was refined, they returned to the students and presented the final plan. This proved successful. They were to deliver what they had asked for and what excited them about this application. Each group had expressed a large value and need for their product.     VKLiQ is a mobile platform that will deliver smart networking solutions and eCommerce to university campuses. VKLiQ is working with a vetted software development company to ensure a quality product by a qualified and invested group. Launching the product in a unique way will be their first step to capturing the audience. Again, this was identified in their focus groups of college students. Their goal is to visit multiple universities and create unique events that fit individuals and their interests. Events will be free to the user, requiring only that they have the app downloaded and user profile set on their mobile device. VKLiQ will market to all potential users as well by offering internship programs to selected students as they create and post events and market through other social media platforms. There has been a 60% drop of users age 18-24 from Facebook. That is more than 11 million young people since 2011. Yet their industry shows an almost 100% growth in the last 3 years. They currently have no competitors in this market space.","Commerce and Shopping, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Since its inception in 1945, and increasingly after it emerged as the flagship of neoconservatism in the 1970s, the magazine has been consistently engaged with several large, interrelated questions: the fate of democracy and of democratic ideas in a world threatened by totalitarian ideologies; the state of American and Western security; the future of the Jews, Judaism, and Jewish culture in Israel, the United States, and around the world; and the preservation of high culture in an age of political correctness and the collapse of critical standards. Many of COMMENTARY’s articles have been controversial, and more than a few have been hugely influential, touchstones for debate and discussion in universities, among policy analysts in and out of government, within the ranks of professionals and community activists of all kinds, and in circles of serious thought worldwide. A large number of articles can be counted as landmarks of American letters and intellectual life. Agree with it or disagree with it, COMMENTARY cannot be ignored. To read it is to take part in the great American discussion.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
