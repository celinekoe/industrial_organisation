The licensed technology was developed based on research efforts done by NBE's founder at Virginia Tech. NBE has a high-volume production facility at the Virginia Tech Corporate Research Center in Blacksburg, Virginia. The innovation of NBE’s nanoTach® technology comes from proprietary formulation and procedures for making uniform pastes of nanoscale silver powders. In recent years, a low-temperature joining technique (LTJT) based on silver sintering has emerged as a promising lead-free die-attach solution to replace soldering or epoxy curing. However, the LTJT process with existing micron-scale silver pastes requires a force in excess of 300 Kg on a 1 cm x 1 cm chip to lower the silver sintering temperature. Using NBE’s nanoTach® pastes that can be sintered at low temperature without pressure, the LTJT process is significantly simplified. The nanoTach® technology was recognized with a 2007 R&D 100 Award — a mark of excellence known to industry, government, and academia as proof that the product is one of the most innovative ideas of the year.","Information Technology, Manufacturing, Science and Engineering",,,1-10,2,Seed,,USD,,150000,USD,150000,"National Science Foundation, Virginia Venture Partners",1,2,,Private,,,,,,
