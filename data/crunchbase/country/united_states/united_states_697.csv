The MEDoctor artificial intelligence based health assessment system won’t replace a medical visit to the doctor to have the final diagnosis and the correct treatment. But it will be useful to identify which pain, disease or illness can correspond to the symptoms you have and then make the choice of the physician to see or the treatment to follow. The MEDoctor Symptom Checker is a guide that will help you for all kinds of problems, for a benign disease as a cold or something more serious as a cancer. MEDoctor is one of the world’s most advanced symptom checkers, with its artificial intelligence and the patents to protect it. Diseases we can detect include back pain, knee pain, breast cancer, diabetes, skin cancer, heart disease, liver disease, depression, body aches, diarrhea, kidney infection, asthma, lymphoma. The list of possible disease covered is now close to 1'000. The MEDoctor Symptom Checker Version 4.1 is available “Free-of-Cost” to individuals worldwide. Individuals, family members and friends may use it as often as necessary and wherever the Internet is accessible. The system is user-friendly and works on any web-enabled device. Prior to 2017, MEDoctor had worked on and developed patient enrollment systems, such as registration at the HMO, delivery of basic health symptoms and populating of electronic health records. These systems, essentially mainframe computer based, were targeting hospitals, HMOs and IPAs and with the assistance of a healthcare professional. Since 2014, MEDoctor has taken a different route by progressively building upon its legacy systems a brand new technology, capable of running on the Cloud and suited for the patient on his smartphone. Thereafter, when the patient decides to speak to a physician, he can immediately deliver his accumulated data, symptoms and likely diseases, to facilitate the physicians diagnosis.",Health Care,4,"Armand J.
