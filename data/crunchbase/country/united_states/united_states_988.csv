At the same time, they thought of their friends and family who were artists - making beautiful art, but they had to abandon their creative talents so they could pay the bills. Something just didn’t make sense. After continuing to ask questions, they realized they were not alone, so they started to build, test, and tinker until…they launched ARTtwo50 in July 2013. Nine months later, May 1, 2014, ARTtwo50 was reborn as Vango along with the launch of a smaller version of their iPad app on the iPhone. The reason they changed from 'ARTtwo50' was that they wanted a name that was catchy and did not box us in on price. Given that they are a marketplace, they mashed up things that take two people (Tango) and key components of their app (Visualization). ‘Vango’ just came out and they loved the sound and energy.","Commerce and Shopping, Data and Analytics, Design, Information Technology, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Software",4,"Brandon Flayler, Ethan Appleby, Patrick Coughlin, Win Raguini",1-10,5,,4695000,USD,4695000,4695000,USD,4695000,"500 Global, Soma Capital, TSVC, Zillionize, Social Starts",1,15,,Private,,,,,,

With a dozen or more underlying causes, dry eye is notoriously difficult to diagnose and treat, and if left untreated, it can lead to permanent corneal damage. Patients with even moderate dry eye can suffer from debilitating symptoms that lead to a drastically reduced quality of life. Current treatment options are limited, and most patients rely on over-the-counter eye drops for temporary relief. But because they neither treat the root cause nor appropriately address the symptoms, current products on the market fail to provide adequate relief and must be reapplied as often as 6-12 times every day.

LookSharp allows companies of all sizes to build their employment brand on campus and expand their college hiring reach to more universities.   Founded in 2009 by Andrew Maguire and Nathan Parcells, InternMatch (now LookSharp) began as a Washington only platform.  In September of 2010 InternMatch expanded their services to the west coast.  In November of 2011 InternMatch expanded nationally and launched their Campus Hub product which stays up year-round and displays rich content about a company including, video, photos and social media streams.  The goal is help students better select where to apply and help companies find hires more likely to succeed. In January of 2013 InternMatch expanded their Campus Hub so companies use it to not only act as a central, easy to update location for their internship programs, but also could build unique messages for underclassmen, diverse students and new grad hires.  InternMatch also launched a pared down self-service version of their Campus Hub, allowing smaller students to add rich content and helping make the internship discover process for students on InternMatch more complete. Overall, to support it's college hiring ecosystem LookSharp focuses on three things: First, LookSharp is looking to make the internship search and posting process incredibly simple. On the LookSharp platform both internship seekers and employers can search for a match, receive skill and location based matching recommendations, and access tools to manage the application process. Students can also search and apply to opportunities without registering.   Second, LookSharp has built and continues to construct an evolving library of resources and tools. Students can access tools for resume creation, internship preparation, and more. Organizations can access resources that help with intern management, program development and advice on compensation.  Third, LookSharp has built the infrastructure to help interested students connect with socially responsible positions especially at nonprofit organizations.

Good passwords are hard to remember so users take short cuts to work around. With Authomate, credentials are stored on the smartphone – eliminating the human element from the authentication flow.  Authomate simplifies the user experience by allowing the user’s smartphone in proximity to an application, website, system, or device to seamlessly authenticate the user, while eliminating the need to enter user names, passwords and one-time codes or answering challenge questions – enabling companies to implement stronger, always on security and enforce policies, in each case, without complicating or frustrating their end users and customers. Key features include: enablement of multifactor authentication using contextually aware, dynamic factors; the ability to share access without sharing credentials; the ability to interface with VPNs and other non-web based applications that require credential input (including login for Macs and PCs); geofencing and geotagging; date and time restrictions; biometrics; defense against phishing sites; mitigating attack surfaces used to steal credentials; and robust logging of access.  Authomate allows enterprises to implement strong security policies that can be easily adopted by their users and customers, while eliminating the vulnerabilities of weak and reused passwords, forgotten passwords that lead to costly recovery processes, and password spreadsheets that may be shared between team members, and eliminates attack surfaces used to harvest credentials (e.g., malware, keyloggers, Man-in-the-Middle, Man-in-the-Browser, phishing and social engineering). Authomate’s solution is designed to fit within the enterprise’s existing security framework so it can be implemented in weeks, not months or years as required by other authentication solutions. While Authomate’s initial focus is on user authentication, the solution extends beyond access to applications and can be used for any transaction requiring credentials to be given to establish trust and access. The solution architecture reverses the credential flow, thereby eliminating the ability to compromise static devices like point of sale terminals, kiosks, ATMs, or websites for card not present, disabling the ability to use these avenues as an attack vector to steal credentials.

By applying its innovative ultra-thin and durable coating solutions, DropWise serves enormous markets that were previously inaccessible by conventional coating technologies. Heat exchangers are a crucial part of every thermal fluid system, from the intercoolers and radiators used to cool cars and trucks, to the condensers and evaporators that drive HVAC/R equipment, to the massive boilers and condensers that drive manufacturing processes and power plants. They rely on very thin heat transfer surfaces that are extremely sensitive to fouling and corrosion, which creates a process bottleneck and forces operators to either reduce output capacity, consume more energy to compensate, or shut down completely to clean the affected heat exchanger.  For all of these problems, conventional liquid-based anti-fouling and anti-corrosion coatings are too thick, and often make the problem worse by insulating the heat transfer surfaces. Faced with this unacceptable performance tradeoff, the status quo is to leave the equipment uncoated and to bear the significant costs of the fouling and corrosion that inevitably occur. Using an innovative vapor-based deposition process, DropWise coatings are chemically grafted to virtually any surface and built up to precise thicknesses. The chemical grafting provides an extremely durable bond that has surpassed testing under severe industrial conditions, and the coating thicknesses can be tuned to nanometer precision to be hundreds of times thinner than conventional coatings. DropWise has secured a license to the MIT patent applications, and is developing a coating platform built from a wide library of precursor materials to address different applications. Low surface energy coatings are used to break up insulating films of condensate into droplets, enabling a 7x increase in heat transfer that allows the coating to boost the efficiency of a wide range of processes, from steam power generation and desalination to HVAC/R and chemical processing; while another chemically inert formulation is used to protect against corrosive environments.","Energy, Manufacturing, Natural Resources, Science and Engineering, Sustainability",5,"Adam Paxson, Colin Gounden, David Borrelli, Karen Gleason, Kripa Varanasi",11-50,8,,2794000,USD,2794000,4577837,USD,4577837,"National Science Foundation, Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, MassChallenge, Henkel Ventures, NXT Ventures",3,5,,Private,,,,,,
