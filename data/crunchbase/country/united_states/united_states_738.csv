This business consulting and sales firm exceeds their client’s goals while providing professional growth opportunities to their employees.  The environment within this Denver office is electric! From their daily team meetings to their weekly after work get-togethers, the team comradery is like none other. Walking into the office in the morning is not like you would expect. The music is up loud, there are happy faces everywhere and everyone is anxiously waiting to start their day. You can’t help but be in a good mood when you start your day this way! After work, once a week (and more if you want) the team gets together at a local spot to literally just hang out. The best part is that it’s optional…and almost everyone is in attendance! That speaks loudly to the type of relationship these coworkers have. It all starts with the people that make up the Denver Concepts team. They come from all walks of life, educational backgrounds, and professional experience but they share one thing: a personal drive to be successful. All employees are required to start in the same entry level position within the company, receive the same type of training and mentoring, and then what they do with the opportunity that they are given is up to them! The reason behind this is the tried and true philosophy that the ‘cream rises to the top’. Typically, someone with high integrity, a strong will to succeed, a desire to help others and a commitment to ongoing learning excels, and rises up the ladder quickly, with this company.  With a team that has a personal mission to help one another succeed, a client that is as big as they come, and a management staff that is willing to do whatever it takes with integrity… there is not much that will get in the way of Denver Concepts. They are on their way to being the preferred vendor when it comes to business consulting needs in the metro Denver area and we recommend connecting with them on LinkedIn to keep up with their success story.","Administrative Services, Other, Professional Services, Sales and Marketing",1,Michele Metzger,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
