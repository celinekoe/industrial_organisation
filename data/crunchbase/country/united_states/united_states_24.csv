President Dwight D. Eisenhower established the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in 1958, partially in response to the Soviet Union's launch of the first artificial satellite the previous year. NASA grew out of the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics (NACA), which had been researching flight technology for more than 40 years. President John F. Kennedy focused NASA and the nation on sending astronauts to the moon by the end of the 1960s. Through the Mercury and Gemini projects, NASA developed the technology and skills it needed for the journey. On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first of 12 men to walk on the moon, meeting Kennedy's challenge. Meanwhile, NASA was continuing the aeronautics research pioneered by NACA. It also conducted purely scientific research and worked on developing applications for space technology, combining both pursuits in developing the first weather and communications satellites. After Apollo, NASA focused on creating a reusable ship to provide regular access to space: the space shuttle. First launched in 1981, the space shuttle flew more than 130 successful flights before retiring in 2011. In 2000, the United States and Russia established permanent human presence in space aboard the International Space Station, a multinational project representing the work of 16 nations. NASA also has continued its scientific research. In 1997, Mars Pathfinder became the first in a fleet of spacecraft that will explore Mars in the next decade, as we try to determine if life ever existed there. The Terra and Aqua satellites are flagships of a different fleet, this one in Earth orbit, designed to help us understand how our home world is changing. NASA's aeronautics teams are focused on improved aircraft travel that is safer and cleaner. Throughout its history, NASA has conducted or funded research that has led to numerous improvements to life here on Earth.","Government and Military, Hardware, Science and Engineering, Software, Transportation",1,Dwight D.

Audio/Video applications can be built with SignalWire that run in the mobile browser with no additional software and allow an experience that can unlock communications with a virtual office, AI bots, PSTN termination, gateways to remote call centers, and much more.  With the evolving mobile SDK, rich applications can be built as native apps and the other side of every call is not just a ""room"" but a full-fledged routable telecommunications backend with additional programmable control for every call. SignalWire is founded on the principle of work-from-anywhere dating back to the turn of the century and continues that tradition with a fully distributed workforce spanning 16 US states and 11 countries in nearly every inhabited time zone. This remote culture has helped to shape the way our products and services have evolved and have proved to be invaluable amid the pandemic crisis in 2020. The core of SignalWire is made up of several networked nodes transforming the computing power of its host system into IP-based telecommunications relays that are demand-driven and horizontally scalable. The breadth of the SignalWire technology ranges from mature interfaces like SIP and PSTN to state-of-the-art techniques in live video and HD audio.

Our predictive prep recommendations can save restaurants money on labor and minimize food waste, all while increasing productivity and profitability. By automating the manual process of determining what to prep each day, restaurants can focus on providing quality service to their customers. Our Story With a shared recognition of the long-unaddressed needs of restaurant operators, Matt and Osa co-founded ClearCOGS. Both Matt and Osa have a deep understanding of the unique challenges and pressures faced by restaurants and are dedicated to using their knowledge and expertise to support and empower individuals in the industry. ​ Matt's journey as a restaurant owner was not an easy one.  At just 21 years old, he was given the opportunity to buy a struggling sandwich shop.  The AC was out, you smell that the grease trap hadn't been cleaned in months, no staff, ice buckets on the equipment compressors to keep them from overheating, the list went on and on.  Despite these challenges, Matt worked tirelessly to turn the business around. He put in long, grueling hours and sacrificed his own well-being to get the restaurant back on track and went on to open and operate multiple more locations. Having put in the long, grueling hours and sacrifices required to run a successful restaurant, he knew that there had to be a better way.    That's where Osa enters the scene. Osa, originally from Nigeria, moved to Indiana at the age of 18 to study Electrical Engineering at the University of Illinois in Champaign (Matt's hometown).  After completing his Masters in Computer Engineering and working for a few years in Silicon Valley, Osa launched his first startup, where he met Matt.  After selling his startup to one of their largest customers, Osa co-founded Fifth Star Funds, a nonprofit venture capital firm focused on investing in minority-led companies in the Chicago region. ​ It wasn't until Matt dove into the world of programming and data science that the idea for ClearCOGS was born.  What started as a project between Osa & Matt to reduce food waste quickly turned into the restaurant industry's first AI operations manager.    Now, ClearCOGS acts as a translator between complex machine learning and the needs of restaurant managers, providing real-time answers to the everyday questions faced by restaurants.  Together, Matt and Osa are dedicated to helping restaurants streamline their operations, reduce their costs, and increase their profits.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Commerce and Shopping, Data and Analytics, Food and Beverage, Information Technology, Science and Engineering, Software",2,"Matthew Wampler, Osayanmo Osarenkhoe",11-50,2,Seed,950000,USD,950000,950000,USD,950000,"MATH Venture Partners, CIC Angels",1,2,,Private,,,,,,
