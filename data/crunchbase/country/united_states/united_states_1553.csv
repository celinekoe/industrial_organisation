The company’s Solafeet ST-400 tanning bed for the feet is a patented design that eliminates the white feet/sock line tan associated with playing sports in the sun. It is being marketed to golfers, tennis players, runners, bicyclists, walkers, and all others who seek to solve the problem of their untanned feet. Utilizing four (4) powerful Wolff Systems tanning bulbs, the Solafeet unit will safely produce a natural tan with only 15 minutes of usage per day: while on the computer, watching TV, or just sitting in a chair. It’s ideal for golfers or tennis players who continue to tan their legs but not their feet while playing several times per week. In a spot survey in the Sarasota, Fl market covering  328 women golfers at 5 separate private country clubs, 322 (98%) complained of white feet. Many also indicated that their male companion had the same problem. With over 1.05 million women golfers at private country clubs and over 26.1 million total golfers in the U.S. alone, a large niche market is available. Adding together tennis (+25 MM), running (+11.5 MM), bicycling (+22MM), and walkers creates a sizable domestic market. Internationally, this market doubles in size. Solafeet will be a financial success if  >0.1% of the women golfers market segment is captured. Over 850 Solafeet units have been sold online at: www.solafeet.com. A random survey of purchasers had a 30% response rate, and every response indicated that they would recommend the product to a friend. The units are manufactured in an ISO 9002 rated facility in Largo, Fl that meets all UL/FDA standards and is capable of producing 2500 units/week. The marketing strategy is to drive sales directly to the website instead of relying on distributors,  preserving the existing 105% markup over cost. An equity investment of $500K is being sought to proceed with the advertising strategy.","Manufacturing, Other, Software",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

PositiveTALK is a fun and engaging app that targets a rapidly growing online community of hundreds of millions of positive-minded people on Facebook, Twitter and other leading social media networks. The latest scientific research indicates that increasing the level of “positivity” can have a significant positive impact on a person’s health, wealth, relationships and happiness, and improve a person’s self esteem and influence with friends, family and co-workers.  PositiveTALK calculates a proprietary PositiveTALK Score daily for people, companies, places and brands, based on the positive or negative sentiment of posts, quantity of posts, number of friends on Facebook and Twitter, as well as other analytic factors. The more positive a user’s posts are and the more often a user POSTS, LIKES or SHARES comments with friends on Facebook and Twitter, the higher their PositiveTALK Score (PT Score) will be and the more PositivePOINTS and Badges they will accumulate.  To help improve their PositiveTALK Score, users can post their own positive comments to friends on both Facebook and Twitter or can post positive quotes from PositiveTALK’s database of over 200,000 quotes and picture quotes from more than 23,000 famous authors. Users can also post regular status updates to both Facebook and Twitter that can include attached image files up to 3 MB each, allowing users to create, post and share their own inspirational images and positive picture quotes to their online friends.  PositiveTALK provides tools and analysis to help improve a person’s positivity, including online “recommendations” to help users improve the quality of their posts on Facebook and Twitter, and Positivity Graphs to help analyze a person’s online positivity and the positivity of their friends and following. Users can analyze and compare the changes in PT Score for themselves and their friends over the last 7, 30 and 90 days and can earn PositivePOINTS and Badges based on achievements and activities. PositiveTALK is the only app available in the market that analyses and scores the positivity of posts, comments and tweets and calculates a daily ""PositiveTALK Score"" for all users and their friends and following, based on the company’s proprietary databases and sentiment analysis technology.","Apps, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
