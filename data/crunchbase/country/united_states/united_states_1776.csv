The initial collections quickly sold out due to the brands' unique athletic fit, smart detailing and luxurious Italian fabrications. Wholesale sales followed in Spring 2009 and the company has steadily grown its collection each season. Besides offering a well-edited assortment of sport shirts, the brand now includes outerwear, sport coats, leather jackets as well as swimwear. Today, ZACHARY PRELL is available in over 200 stores throughout the US, including Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom and Saks Fifth Avenue as well as leading specialty retailers such as Boyds in Philadelphia, Andrisen Morton in Denver and GARYS in Newport Beach.

The only way to become part of a strong technical team is to elevate your craft to that level. ie Technical interviews cannot be ‘hacked’, to nail them one must invest time in becoming a better engineer   Second: It only makes sense to learn from engineers who themselves have made the cut. Ie one needs to prepare by learning from Engineers who are currently already working and Hiring at Google, Facebook, Amazon and other top companies   Third: One needs a Methodology that caters to a superior technical curriculum, retention and sustained motivation.

We bring together venues, consumers and brands into one cohesive platform that brings value to all three players in the marketplace. But why is this beneficial? Because without this marketplace, venues don't have data on the guests that visit them. Brands don't have access to see who's buying their products inside specific venues. And, as a result, consumers aren't able to receive personalized offers based on their habits and preferences. Which is the very experience that consumers, brands and establishments have come to know and love in the e-commerce world. That's where Vēmos comes in. We understand the untapped value that exists in the physical hospitality industry when systems and data are all connected in one platform. Vēmos plays in the unique gap that exists between POS data and credit card data, where SKU and demographic level data is lost in the handshake. We close this gap by integrating with both POS systems and payment processors to provide a platform that enables 1) hospitality venues to understand their guests and business trends; 2) brands to see who's buying their products inside specific venues; and 3) consumers to easily pay their checks and be rewarded by both venues & brands through a universal system. This centralized marketplace allows for the first ubiquitous membership program across both venues and brands, leveraging a unique ad network to directly influence consumers' in-store buying habits.","Apps, Commerce and Shopping, Data and Analytics, Food and Beverage, Mobile, Software, Travel and Tourism",3,"Anid Monsur, Parag Shah, Whitney Johnson",11-50,2,Seed,740000,USD,740000,740000,USD,740000,"Revolution, Start-Up Chile, Revolution’s Rise of the Rest Seed Fund",,3,,Private,,,,,,

Our desktop app, a key innovation, captures players' performances in real-time, ensuring transparency, trust, and seamless payouts. These micro-tournaments provide an avenue for passionate gamers to participate multiple times a day, turning their skills into real profits. Problem Addressed: In the gaming community, players frequently face challenges when engaging in wagers or bets. The lack of a trusted mechanism to verify opponents' performances often results in payment disputes, impacting the overall gaming experience. GameWagrs steps in to provide a secure platform where contestants can confidently compete, assured that they will receive their winnings. And our Personal Parlay feature addresses the “burn-out” many gamers feel after hours of playing their favorite game, and only having a handful of “weapon skins” or worthless in-game currencies. Current Landscape: Traditional gaming wagers rely on trust, with players often resorting to external payment platforms like Venmo. Verifying opponents' performances requires watching live streams, creating a cumbersome process that disrupts the gaming flow. Our Solution: GameWagrs solves this problem by securing contestants' funds in an escrow account. Real-time game data from our desktop app/API determines the winner, and funds are automatically released to the victor. This innovative approach simplifies the wagering process, making it secure, transparent, and user-friendly. Behavioral Impact: Our platform transforms the behavior of gamers by offering a seamless and trustworthy environment for wagers. Users can engage confidently, knowing that payouts are guaranteed, enhancing their overall gaming experience. This shift in behavior not only fosters trust but also positions GameWagrs as the go-to platform for skill-based competitions. Revenue Model: We charge a nominal fee for each wager made on our platform, ensuring sustainable revenue while providing users with a fair and transparent gaming experience. This fee structure supports continuous platform improvements and innovations, enhancing the overall value for our users. Personal Parlay Feature: In addition to micro-tournaments, GameWagrs introduces the ""Personal Parlay"" feature, allowing users to challenge themselves to beat personal records. This unique offering caters to users seeking individual skill improvement while providing additional opportunities for wagering and profit. Market Opportunity: The esports and skill-based gaming market presents a significant opportunity, with GameWagrs uniquely positioned to tap into the growing demand for transparent and equitable gaming competitions. With a target Total Addressable Monthly Revenue (TAMR) of $1M over 24 months, GameWagrs aligns with the trends of gamers seeking skill-based engagement. User Engagement and Growth: GameWagrs anticipates increased user engagement as the platform expands its game offerings and forges strategic partnerships. With a strong presence on social media, partnerships with content creators, and a growing waitlist of eager users, GameWagrs is poised for a successful launch and sustained growth. Competitive Advantage: GameWagrs distinguishes itself by leveraging a desktop app for real-time data validation, eliminating the dependency on contestant livestreams. This not only ensures accessibility for a broader user base but also prevents classification as gambling, allowing for more extensive marketing and user acquisition efforts. Team: Led by Andrew Lea (CEO), Nico Deguzman (CMO), and Kevan Donley (COO), the GameWagrs team combines extensive experience in gaming, content creation, and business operations. Andrew's vision, Nico's esports expertise, and Kevan's engineering acumen drive the team toward creating a revolutionary gaming platform. Future States: GameWagrs envisions transformative outcomes, including a shift in market perception, industry recognition, increased engagement, market expansion, and a more diverse gaming ecosystem. As the platform gains momentum, GameWagrs is poised to become synonymous with transparent, skill-based gaming.","Gaming, Internet Services, Software",1,Andrew Lea,1-10,1,Seed,20000,USD,20000,20000,USD,20000,,,,,Private,,,,,,
