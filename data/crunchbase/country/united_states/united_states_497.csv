The trades have changed in many ways, but our needs for running water, electricity, and more have not changed. The trades are experiencing rapid change through worker turnover and a lack of interest from new people going into the skilled trades. This means itâs harder than ever to connect with the right trades. This brought about the idea of SkilledHub. SkilledHub.com allows skilled professionals to find more customers and creates awareness about the industry. In short, weâre helping strengthen the skilled trades through serving homeowners. SkilledHub was created after realizing how difficult it is to book a reliable skilled professional in a timely manner.

These ratings provide trust, confidence and encourage great service and workmanship. For Skilled Professionals The innovative booking feature makes it easier for customers to book a professional instantaneously without any telephone tag.

The platform empowers skilled professionals by providing them with a backend CRM that keeps track of their clients, and analytics software to evaluate their business.  The reviews and ratings are based on several factors such as material, labor, budget, timelines, and professionalism. This system encourages great workmanship and helps professionals gain credibility.
