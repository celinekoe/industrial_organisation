The trades have changed in many ways, but our needs for running water, electricity, and more have not changed. The trades are experiencing rapid change through worker turnover and a lack of interest from new people going into the skilled trades. This means it’s harder than ever to connect with the right trades. This brought about the idea of SkilledHub. SkilledHub.com allows skilled professionals to find more customers and creates awareness about the industry. In short, we’re helping strengthen the skilled trades through serving homeowners. SkilledHub was created after realizing how difficult it is to book a reliable skilled professional in a timely manner.    What We Offer At SkilledHub For Homeowners Skilledhub.com allows you to search for skilled professionals using a variety of search criteria, so you can work with the best of the best, or with up-and-coming contractors in your local area.

Search skilled professionals and book appointments online directly with the professional. No more telephone tag! You can write reviews and rate the professionals that you have contacted. These ratings provide trust, confidence and encourage great service and workmanship. For Skilled Professionals The innovative booking feature makes it easier for customers to book a professional instantaneously without any telephone tag.  The invoicing feature/quote module enables professionals to handle the payment of jobs online, instead of relying on the traditional payment method of cash exchange. The platform empowers skilled professionals by providing them with a backend CRM that keeps track of their clients, and analytics software to evaluate their business.  The reviews and ratings are based on several factors such as material, labor, budget, timelines, and professionalism. This system encourages great workmanship and helps professionals gain credibility. SkilledHub.com is perfect for skilled professionals without an online presence, as they can create a profile with their portfolio, including pictures and videos, to get high-quality leads.  Our Task Portal is all you need to start receiving customer leads today. On SkilledHub you can pay per lead or opt-in for a monthly plan. At SkilledHub you only pay for leads on jobs that you would like to do. Here is how it works: A customer submits a job on SkilledHub by providing their contact information, a timeline, job description, and budget details. Skilledhub.com will then review the customer submission and send it off to skilled professionals that operate near the customer. To accept the customer lead, just start messaging with the customer. SkilledHub allows three companies to contact the same customer, which encourages good quality work and fair opportunity for professionals and customers.
