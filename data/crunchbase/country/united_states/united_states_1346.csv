It’s been limited to one platform.  A platform full of one-upmanship where there is immense pressure to both fit in and stand out at the same time. Where your career is your identity and titles, status and influence reign supreme.  Basically, it’s a sans-serif hellscape disguised as a necessary resource for young professionals. We thought that enough is enough and decided to do something about it - We’re not just challenging the status quo; we’re completely shattering it.   True networking is about focusing on who you are; not what you are. It’s about being connected and staying connected as you advance throughout your career.   We as a people have more contacts than ever, but have never been less connected to each other.  Friends, followers, contacts, connections, online, offline, they are all over place - in different apps, emails and on your phone.  It’s a hot mess.   At Cleverly, we had the audacity to give you the power to turn your scattered networks into an organized community; a community controlled entirely by you.   To us connecting with others is a right.  It should be quick and easy.  You should be able to share only what you want and nothing you don’t; and just as importantly, you shouldn’t have to let some tech company track and spy on you in order to do so.  Bunch of creepers if you ask us.   We’re a new, innovative solution; not a traditional institution.   Our privacy policy is simple and can be explained in just five words: Your privacy is our policy.  We don’t track you; we don’t collect or sell any of your personal info – we just help you connect to whomever you want, however you want.","Apps, Software",3,"Aaron Scicchitano, Jeremy Cleverly, Kris Anderson",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Whether it’s a midwestern lightning storm, tornado warning, strong winds, deep freeze, or a blizzard, the power could go out at any time.

We intend to encourage the Americas Region talent (also the Region Emerging talent) to integrate into the financial sector, either as educated users who seek to improve their future projections or for all those who want a career change or better yet start a career in a highly demanding sector. Our intention is to pave the way for the integration of Latin American Regional Talent into newly emerging markets and established US Institutional Centers. We welcome those who seek an education necessary to elevate students into careers all across the financial spectrum. We are pioneers in providing an education for sustainability, cultivating financial talent for application in global leadership positions.Our team is acutely aware of the utmost importance of the Latin American region composed of over 20 countries and 625 million people. As the fastest growing minority within the United States, Latin America will surely play a distinct role in the history of the Western Hemisphere for the century to come. The region has historically benefited from global demand for its commodities, but lesser-known thriving domestic consumption and a growing manufacturing and technology sector is fueling unprecedented economic advancement. Once shunned by investors and businesses due to the “boom and bust” nature of many of the region’s local economies, stringent monetary policies have allowed many of these countries to develop well capitalized banking systems exhibiting healthy credit records. Regional wealth, entrepreneurship and direct investment activity have increased significantly in recent years. By 2017, foreign direct investments into Latin America and the Caribbean exceeded US$ 167 billion annually with a slim majority of inflows directed to medium-high and high-technology sectors.Brasil, México, Chile, Colombia and Peru have received the bulk of recent investments, but distressed nations such as Argentina, Venezuela, and Cuba remain poised for monumental shifts. The Netherlands, U.S., and Spain have historically been the largest foreign investors in Latin America with China, Russia, Japan, UK, and other important economies playing a large role as well. Today the region is experiencing the positive impact of the talented forces managing LatAm Governments, Regulatory Agencies, Central Banks, Public and Corporate Pension Funds, Foundations, Endowments, Banks, Family Offices, Fund of Funds, Listed and Private Corporations, Insurance Companies, Private Banking Divisions, Asset Managers, Financial Boutiques, Investment Advisors and High-Net-Worth Individuals. In the United States, the growing Hispanic community is creating incredible opportunities for cross marketing and distribution. This progress is sustaining a developing Latin American middle class all across the globe. There still remains an extent of work to be done to help the region achieve its full potential, and Ilafin in partnership with WallStreetSur is delighted to be at the forefront of this region’s consolidation process by helping market participants and other stakeholders benefit from the upcoming period of unparalleled growth and opportunity in the global and local capital markets. Our intention consists in closing the educational gap and bringing talented people into the fascinating Asset Management Community. It is our hope that investors, overall market participants, students, and simple individuals may all play a role in the never-ending goal of building a better society.","Education, Financial Services, Media and Entertainment",1,Victor Hugo Rodriguez,11-50,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
