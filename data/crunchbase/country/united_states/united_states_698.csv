Feldman, the creator of the PC/104 IEEE standard and the 5-1/4"" form factor embedded Single Board Computer. In March of 2002 National Semiconductor Corporation advised Mr. Feldman that it would not manufacture the ZFx86™ for ZF Micro Solutions. ZF Micro Solutions filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of the County of Santa Clara, State of California, as ZF Micro Solutions, Inc. vs. National Semiconductor Corporation. It was filed on April 25, 2002 under case # CV807339. Effective January 31, 2005, ZF Micro Solutions finalized a settlement agreement with National Semiconductor Corporation ending an almost 3 year legal dispute concerning the ZFx86™ FailSafe® System-on-a-Chip. On January 31, 2005 National Semiconductor delivered all ZFx86™ property to ZF Micro Solutions. This allowed ZF to establish a new manufacturing source for the ZFx86™ and a family of additional products. Our current manufacturing partner is IBM Microelectronics In 1995, Mr. Feldman founded ZF Micro Devices, and began manufacturing and marketing a family of products based on an award-winning computer module called the OEMmodule Single Component Computer. These devices were the most highly integrated, PC-compatible controller modules in the embedded systems market. They included full motherboard hardware and software functionally in a single, highly reliable component smaller than a credit card.  Mr. Feldman then took this small form factor to the next level and combined full x86 PC functionality together with its patented fail-safe technology, into a single chip, the ZFx86™ “PC-on-a-Chip.” This device, just 1.4” square, represents the next level of integration of PC functionality. ZFx86™ is the only chip with a built-in FailSafe® mechanism for restoring operation after a system failure. The Intel x86 compatible ZFx86™ chip runs most PC software without modification and is bundled with a full PC BIOS and Linux O/S - and it boots by simply applying power! Today, our full time efforts are focused on rebuilding the company and expanding our product offering.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Manufacturing, Science and Engineering, Software",,,1-10,1,,15000000,USD,15000000,15000000,USD,15000000,"Samsung Electronics, Sands Brothers Asset Management, National Semiconductor, TAT Capital Partners",1,4,,Private,,,,,,
