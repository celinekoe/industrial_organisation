Our experienced advisors provide comprehensive and pragmatic solutions to all aspects of wealth management, aligning our approach with the interests of our clients. Founded in 2012, LeoGroup is an independent partnership owned by its partner and employees. We believe it is a privilege to be a true partnership, and endeavor to work alongside our clients in everything we do. Partnership is a Privilege The Era That Defined Wall Street is Over. The financial crisis of the late 2000s ushered in a dramatic change to Wall Street and exposed the Street for what it was. It will never be the same. We believe the partnership structure promotes a greater alignment of interest between a firm and its clients. We understand the capital requirements of a global financial institution may no longer support the partnership structure, but we are nostalgic for the days when Wall Street worked alongside clients as true partners. The author Michael Lewis chronicled the era’s excess in the book “Liar’s Poker,” followed by his book “The End,” the essence of which is summarized below: The heads of the Wall Street firms all said what an awful thing it was for Wall Street to go public, but when the temptation arose, they all gave in. (Goldman Sachs was the last of the firms to maintain it’s partnership structure until 1999). Turning a partnership into a corporation allows for the complete transfer of financial risk to the shareholders. “When things go wrong, it’s their problem and if a firm screws up badly enough, it’s the government’s problem. It’s laissez-faire until you get in deep [expletive].” We are a Partnership. Shared Risk, Shared Return. LeoGroup is an independent partnership (LLC) owned by its partners & employees. We believe it is a privilege to be a partnership and endeavor to work alongside clients in everything we do.","Financial Services, Lending and Investments",2,"John Clair, Matthew Allain",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

We strive to give control back to the end users, from our automated migration and transparent a-la-carté pricing to our simple and customizable interface with drag and drop components. Security and privacy are important, that’s why we use end to end military-grade AES-256 bit encryption and ensure all accounts are compliant to the most stringent requirements. All data is encrypted at rest (server side), in transit (from server to client), and client side. We are committed to the open source community through making our underlying tools that we develop free to use and share. Because we use open source software we are able to rapidly develop and release new services monthly. We plan to give back to the open source community through charitable contributions and initiatives.

Whether companies need to secure confidential financial or credit card information, shield client data, guard intellectual property or collaborate on large-scale projects, they give companies the power of secure control over their data. They are the only end-to-end solution for businesses that care about the security of their data in the cloud. Whether your data is at rest or in transit, on your network or in the cloud, it will always be secure with their advanced identity management and encryption technologies. They simultaneously provide tamper-proof audit reporting, secure cross-enterprise data collaboration, client and vendor portals and an integrated and configurable workflow. They combine all of this in a multi-platform system that is lightweight and transparent in your day-to-day operation. Their ‘Zero-Knowledge’ privacy means that they can’t even see or access your data. Your data is encrypted at all times so their server never knows the contents of the information you are storing with us. Because of this, your data is never at risk of being stolen or misused, either by internal threats or external hackers. Their unique architecture, which is simple to deploy and use, provides you with the ideal way to collaborate while enhancing security, privacy and workflow. The Center for Strategic and International Studies recently reported that the Internet economy annually generates between $2 trillion and $3 trillion, a share of the global economy that is expected to grow rapidly. Additionally, this report estimates that cyber crime extracts between 15 percent and 20 percent of the value created by the Internet. The most significant costs come from: - Loss of intellectual property - Theft of financial assets and sensitive business information - Opportunity costs - Additional costs for securing networks - Recovering from cyber-attacks, including reputational damage to the hacked company.","Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Internet Services, Privacy and Security, Software",3,"John Galinski, Nigel Walker, Robert Schaeffer",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

SulfurCycle uses a water based, non-toxic suspension of metal oxide particles to capture and convert H2S into elemental sulfur. The H2S capture agent is regenerated in situ simply by blowing air through spent media, which converts captured sulfide into elemental sulfur. Media can be reused up to 30 times; significantly reducing chemical purchasing and waste disposal costs relative to conventional single use scavengers. By recirculating treated gas to digesters operators can control H2S levels inside digesters by treating biogas outside digesters.

We have taught thousands of students in over 40 countries across the globe to learn to trade Mirroring the growth of the entire industry, Trading Advantage has evolved from its roots to the Trading floor. Larry Levin, founding partner and president, has deep ties to the trading floor as he began as a runner at the old Chicago Mercantile Exchange in the early 1990s.  Larry quickly climbed the ranks from phone clerk to desk manager to eventually trading his own account. At the height of his trading career, Larry averaged between 2500-3000 S&P contracts per day to become both a profitable and respected trader in the E-mini S&P 500 futures pit. From his years of experience on the trading floor, Larry recognized that successful trading over the long haul requires a sound strategy and a specific plan. Sensing the inevitable shift away from the open outcry pits to an electronic marketplace, Larry founded Trading Advantage to share the secrets of his success with a larger audience. He partnered with Josh Lewis in 1998 and they are joint owners of the company.. Now a nationally recognized media figure, Larry has been interviewed hundreds of times on virtually every major financial media outlet including CNBC, Bloomberg TV, and Fox Business News. Over recent years, Trading Advantage has grown to a full-fledged investment school with a staff of 40 plus dedicated industry leaders. We are committed to being both technological and educational innovators as we continue to refine, improve and update our infrastructure and educational materials. We have partnered with industry leaders who are at the technology forefront including Lightspeed VT , ESIgnal and Bluewater Trading Technology. Trading Advantage has kept pace with the evolution of the financial industry by empowering and educating the individual investor so they can compete in the new technological paradigm. The historical models which had the individual investor being heavily reliant on a financial planner, a stock broker or a banker to both control and execute their investment decisions have dramatically changed. Technological advances and the evolution of a global and more open marketplace make it easier for the individual investor to control their financial future. Trading Advantage has honed in on this demand by providing education solutions so students can effectively learn to take control of their investment portfolios.   We are committed to delivering innovative solutions to our student base via virtual classroom learning environments and one on one educational experiences delivered through state of the art technology. Trading Advantage has built a strong instructor team and developed educational platforms for all major market sectors including multiple future markets, options and stocks.  Our goal is to continuously enhance our current educational offerings while expanding into new markets.","Education, Software",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
