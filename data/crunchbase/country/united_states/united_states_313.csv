Provo Labs has quickly built a strong core team of dedicated employees who are building web sites that can turn into successful businesses. The Provo Labs culture is unique in Utah. They are highly focused on constant networking and learning and they freely share that learning among themselves and with others in the community. All of their companies have official blogs and all of their employees blog. They are all into RSS feeds, Google alerts, podcasting and video blogging. They buy Blackberries for every employee and invite everyone to attend technology and business conferences regularly, so they can all stay on the cutting edge. They use LinkedIn to find contractors, employees and partners. Their technologists, led by Phil Burns, are totally into Web 2.0. They study new web services weekly and share their code libraries with each other. While they develop and use modular technology to do web mashups they also believe that they can reuse their marketing tactics and business models to do ""business mashups."" They think they will succeed as an internet business incubator because they will focus all of their companies on the things they are best at: 1) content acquisition 2) search engines 3) building community and user-generated content 4) internet marketing and 5) subscription business models. One of their doctrines that describes their Provo Labs culture states: ""Most value creation happens outside of the office. Get out of the office!"" What that means is that they know that their relationships with other people, including customers, investors, business owners, and key employees at hundreds of other companies, will be the most important factor in their success. They wholeheartedly subscribe to the concepts in ""The Only Sustainable Edge"" by Harvard Business School professor John Hagel. They focus on what they are great at and then they spend most of their time networking at the edge with their customers and business partners, to make sure they are interfacing with all the right companies that are increasing their capacity faster than anyone else. It's really the business ecosystems that they will play in that will lead to their greatest successes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Victoria Advocate,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/victoria-advocate,News,"Victoria, Texas, United States",Second-oldest newspaper in Texas.,"877,791",Southern US,$10M to $50M,Active,1846-05-08,day,,,,,For Profit,http://www.victoriaadvocate.com,"The Victoria Advocate was founded in 1846, which makes it Texas' second oldest newspaper. They're an independent regional media company and the area’s premier information and advertising source. They deliver results for their advertising partners. The Audit Bureau of Circulations (now Alliance for Audited Media) latest report is in and they still deliver impressive readership. The Victoria Advocate is read by 76,388 adults in the Victoria market Monday through Saturday and 94,330 on Sunday.1 Plus, their Big Wednesday paper is delivered to an additional 17,100 households each week. 1 A research study by Frank N. Magid Associates Publishing Division (formerly MORI Research) indicates that Victoria area residents rate Advocate Media as the top source for community news and information and -- by the largest margin -- for local advertising and shopping information. The inaugural edition of the Advocate was printed May 8, 1846. An extra edition was published that day to inform local citizens of the battle of Palo Alto, the first battle in the Mexican War. The Advocate was first delivered by horseback to points such as Gonzales, New Braunsfels, and San Antonio. Later it was sent by stagecoach when Victoria became the headquarters for three stagecoach lines. The newspaper's first publishers were Thomas Sterne and John David Logan. Both experienced newspapermen, they changed the name of the paper in its first year from “Texan Advocate” to ""Texian Advocate"" in response to requests from Texas pioneers. Sterne and Logan sold the newspaper in 1853. Later editors and publishers included Sam Addison White, Victor Marion Rose, Frank R. Pridham, Edward Daniel Linn, John L. Bartow, Louis Nicholas Hofer, and James McDonald. It was during White's ownership that the newspaper was named the ""Victoria Advocate"" between 1859 and 1861. McDonald introduced the ""Daily Advocate"" in 1897. Both daily and weekly editions were published until 1943. In 1901, after 55 years and nine owners, George H. French acquired the paper and operated it for 41 years. Morris Roberts and a number of leading citizens purchased the paper in October 1942. In April 1961, Roberts purchased all stock and became sole owner of the Advocate. He shared ownership with his son, John M. Roberts, who serves as president and daughter Catherine R. McHaney, who is secretary-treasurer. Dan Easton currently serves as Publisher of the Victoria Advocate. Stephen McHaney, who previously was Co-Publisher with Easton, now serves as President of Texas Community Media (TCM) and Publisher of the Longview News-Journal. Members of the Roberts/McHaney family purchased Longview and 13 other East Texas Newspapers and formed TCM in June 2012. The Advocate has missed publication only a few times because of fires in 1876 and 1892, and the Civil War, when it could not publish due to lack of newsprint. The Advocate's Web site, VictoriaAdvocate.com, was established in 1999.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment",,,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
