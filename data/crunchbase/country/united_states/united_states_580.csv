But they also store the original files and allow users (and those authorized) to download those files and/or purchase DVDs with the files.  Video editing is a pleasure on Motionbox. When editing a video, Motionbox breaks it down visually into frames. Users can edit the file extensively, including linking several video files and removing any portions of files. Mashups with other users' public or shared videos can also be created using Motionbox's extensive editing features.  All of these changes can be pushed back to the original quality files for downloading or DVD burning. Like YouTube and other services, Motionbox allows tagging of video files. But they also allow deep tagging of parts of video files. Users can open a file, select a portion of the video, and tag it.
