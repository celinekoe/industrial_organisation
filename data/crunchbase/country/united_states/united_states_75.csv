They are top marketing and creative professionals who have worked at some of the largest and most creative ad agencies in America. The ad industry has talked of the need to be more nimble in the digital era's shifting media landscape. At the same time, clients are clamoring for greater ROI, creativity and accountability from agencies. But increasingly, agencies are not pulling their weight and clients have become less and less impressed with digital agencies and general market agencies. In fact, in a recent study by Avidan Strategies, nearly 69% of clients cite they no longer have need for digital agencies, while another 48% intend to trim their creative agencies. Nearly 71% of clients surveyed were disappointed with agency accountability a frustration that looms larger given the growing demands within their own organizations for greater ROI effectiveness. The real answer is for agencies to develop different business models constructed to suit clients, not agencies. Pink Collective has done that. We have acknowledged that the economic model of agencies is broken and clients want better service.","Advertising, Design, Professional Services, Sales and Marketing",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

That content is not meant as experiences that can be lived by others, to the point where most viewers are frustrated that they are not living the life they want.  Content creators are also unable to mobilize their communities efficiently on social networks due to the limitations of ""comments"" and ""likes"" interactions. The Trybeo app has two key concepts: 1/ CHALLENGE  Users participate in challenges by uploading photos or videos and get ranked by the community. They express their passions and skills by taking on existing challenges or creating their own. The more users are active, the more points they earn. 2/ CONTEST  Users can participate in contests if they have earned enough points. Contests are sponsored by brands who provide products to the winners. Our business model aims at transforming advertising using challenges and contests to help businesses boost customer engagement and interaction.  On Trybeo, companies who want to promote their products can create contests in order to interact with their prospects. Contests make people do specific actions and amplify the content that the company want to put out there to the audience.  Companies can reach out to a wider consumer base and offer the experience of their products. Our unique approach is changing the way people exchange their experiences in order to give everyone the chance to do remarkable activities. Where other social networks allow people to *show* their experiences, we help them *share* activities and create exciting competitions. People post challenges on Trybeo which become invitations for the rest of the community to become more active. Also, contests that are organized on Trybeo give incentive for people to come back regularly.","Internet Services, Media and Entertainment",3,"Gabriel Villenave, Thomas Loarec, Yannick Maurugeon",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
