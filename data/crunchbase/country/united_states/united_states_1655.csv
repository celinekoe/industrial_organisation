Whether you need relief from pain or simply want to keep your body functioning at its best, a good Mount Pleasant Chiropractor can definitely deliver what you are looking for. There are many Mt Pleasant chiropractors to choose from. We take the time to listen because we care and understand that health issues and concerns can vary widely from person to person. Chiropractors have many hours of training in diagnosis. Their main expertise is the spine, but they also receive training in neurology, internal medicine, and nutrition. Part of their training includes ordering and interpreting the results of X-rays, MRI, CT scans, and lab work. With a broad-based knowledge of the body, a Chiropractor is able to determine the cause of your symptoms. Chiropractors provide conservative and very effective treatments. Patients who are seeking treatment from a Mount Pleasant Chiropractor are assured of receiving only the finest quality care through the use of modern chiropractic equipment and technology. Modalities chiropractors employ to facilitate healing are active and passive muscle release, manual spinal adjustments, activator, and trigger point release. Additionally, chiropractors can prescribe and fit custom therapeutic appliances, such as orthotics and braces when indicated. If your condition requires more aggressive treatment, a Chiropractor can refer you to the appropriate medical doctor for your condition. Our main objective is to help the body to heal itself. As a routine for general health, you should have your spine checked at least once a month. Regular treatments help keep your spine and body working at their optimal performance. This helps you better cope with the stressors of everyday living. Dr. Dennis Hupka and Dr. Lisa Mazzella are dedicated to helping Mount Pleasant residents achieve their wellness objectives — combining skill and expertise that spans the entire chiropractic wellness spectrum.

PlayerMania.com can be described as a combination of Myspace, Facebook and ESPN. It enables athletes to set up a sports profile which displays information about all the sports they play and where they played them. The site even goes as far as letting them link up to current and past high school and college teams by the season that they played. David Wolf, a former division 3 basketball player and founder of PlayerMania.com, believes that pro's shouldn't be the only ones getting all the recognition.  You don't have to be a pro to be a great player. ""There are so many great players out there not making millions of dollars, and it's time to bring them together"", Wolf said. ""We are looking for players who are playing, have played or plan on playing in high school and college."" PlayerMania.com is dedicated to the people out there that play for the love of the game. Wolf came up with the idea of the site after finishing college and finding it hard to find competitive leagues and great players. ""I would go to the local gym and maybe half of the guys could play; that's not fun when you're used to playing against some really great players."" ""I also hated how hard it was to find leagues in my area. I would have to go to every park district's web site and dig through all the programs just to find the basketball league"", Wolf added. The site solves these issues with its advanced player search and league search feature. The site, which is entirely free, also allows players to write their own sports articles. If you ever wanted to be a sports writer, this is your chance. A really cool feature on the site is that it allows players to rate their friends at various categories of the sports they play. This makes it possible to do a search for a specific player based on rating. This feature works great if, for example, you are starting a recreational basketball team and need a center that can rebound and block shots. Now you can just search for centers in your area with high ratings in rebounds and blocks. Every member also gets a virtual trading card with their uploaded photo that flips 360 degrees. If you're a golfer, you can add your scores and the site will figure out your handicap and rank. Wolf says that there are a lot more features in the works. He aims to make this site the center of every player's life.","Internet Services, Sports",1,David Wolf,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Prior to launching OsmoTherapeutics in 2016, Dr. Salim Shah collaborated on a two-year head lice research clinical with a French counterpart.  Their joint effort led to the development of a breakthrough solution to completely eliminate head lice infestations.  Their study concluded that the incomplete removal of nits in the hair leads to the birth of new lice, and consequently, lice recurrence.  Lice recurs because no treatment effectively removes all nits from the hair.  As no available treatment for head lice was 100% ovicidal (able to kill 100% of lice eggs, or nits), the two doctors created a formula that was thoroughly effective at eliminating all nits and all lice. Licemosis Anti-Lice Gel and OsmoBliss Shampoo were thus developed.  The research undertaken and the findings of the team’s clinical research led to the development of these 100% effective products, designed to effectively clear head lice safely and quickly. Their pesticide and toxic-free biological process detaches and kills nits, and also kills the lice that laid them on the hair, including ‘super lice.’ At OsmoTherapeutics, we are committed to fully putting an end to lice recurrence.  We are dedicated to ensuring that no other family will endure the stress and expense of battling head lice.  We use no pesticides or toxic ingredients in our formulas to give everyone a life free of the frustration caused by head lice.
