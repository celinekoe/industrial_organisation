Our goal is to be able to create a better living environment while enhancing the quality of paper with an affordable price. Here at Sugarmade Inc., we’ve created a method where we use 100 percent reclaimed Bagasse along with bamboo fibers as an additive. The Bagasse, which is simply sugarcane fibers, makes up 70 percent of our paper while 30 percent is the bamboo fibers that gives the paper its durability. However, we do not believe in exterminating the entire bamboo plant. Our highly experienced field workers make sure to only harvest the top portion of the bamboo plant allowing for it to rejuvenate what is used. We then gather the Bagasse fibers by using the discarded byproducts from the sugarcane production where we recycle it into our paper production. This process equals to an outstanding 30 percent of recyclable byproducts that we are able to use within our paper, allowing it to be even more environmentally friendly! As if that doesn’t satisfy your eco-friendly needs already, our product is 100 percent biodegradable, compostable, and recyclable. Through our manufacturing process we are able to use less water, less energy, and produce less waste in relation to the tree-based paper production. Imagine this, the tree-based paper industry cuts down about an estimated 4 billion trees worldwide. An average tree growing within a tropical area releases about 48 pounds of carbon dioxide per year. If all of the population were to begin using tree free paper we could be saving the environment an average of 20 billion pounds of carbon dioxide per year. Not only would the trees be appreciative, but so would our overall health! So next time you decide to restock on your printer paper needs, remember to take a step back and think about the trees.","Agriculture and Farming, Manufacturing",,,1-10,,IPO,,,,,,,,,,,Public,2016-11-16,,,SGMD,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/sugarmade-ipo--c4de36a0,OTCQB

From lowering blood pressure and heart rate to increasing immune function and relieving pain, getting touched or doing some touching makes you healthier -- not to mention happier and less anxious. Anyone who's ever gotten a massage knows that it helps you unwind. That's not just a mental sensation: Getting massaged causes muscles to unclench, a racing heart rate to slow, heightened blood pressure to fall, and levels of the stress hormone cortisol to drop. In that relaxed state, your body is able to regroup and recharge. One happy result: a more robust immune system. Gentle touch has been shown to facilitate physical and psychological functioning, particularly in terms of reducing stress, relieving pain, increasing the ability to cope, and general health ratings.","Hardware, Health Care, Science and Engineering, Software, Sports",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
