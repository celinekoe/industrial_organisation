By opening this new center LSPC will be able to provide at the beginning approximately one hundred and fifty to one hundred seventy five units of plasma per month to our local community within the first year.  By year four we will be able to provide five to six thousand units year and by year ten upwards of fifteen thousand units of plasma not only to the Kansas City area, the United States and even throughout the world. The main target audience for donators will be from the age of 18-40.  With the secondary target being of the ages 41+.  All donators will be compensated for their donation.  The current compensation package is $25.00 for the first donation and $35.00 for each additional donation thereafter.  The current market value for one unit of plasma is set at $900-$1200 in the local Kansas City area. Plasma is a necessary part of the medical field that is only produced by the human body and cannot be synthetically reproduced.  As the population increases so does the demand for blood and plasma.  It is safe to say that the future of plasma is only going to grow and the demand increases each and every year.
