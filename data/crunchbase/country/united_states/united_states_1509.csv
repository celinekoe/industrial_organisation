Cleary and several partners, Cleary Gull’s original focus was research, sales, and trading for institutions. In response to client needs as well as market opportunities, they then added Investment Banking and Wealth Management capabilities in the 1990s. In 1998, Tucker Anthony Sutro, a Boston-based financial service firm, acquired Cleary Gull. A few months after Tucker Anthony Sutro was acquired by the Royal Bank of Canada – Dain Rauscher (RBC) in 2001, their principals and employees led a buy back that returned the company to their entrepreneurial roots. “Their overriding desire was to own and control their own destiny for theirselves, their clients and employees,” said Managing Director Bob Warner. Once again independent, they focused on Wealth Management and Investment Banking services. After a merger with MBO Advisors in 2003, they formed a third division called MBO Cleary Advisors Inc., to provide Institutional Investment Advisory services. The result: they grew in size and increased the amount of client assets they have under advisement. Finally, in January of 2011 another step was taken to reinforce a single brand and unify their public image when MBO Cleary Advisors Inc. changed its name to Cleary Gull Advisors Inc. Today, they are privately held and employee-owned. Their three business lines – Investment Banking, Wealth Management and Institutional Advisory – are complementary yet well diversified with over $2.1 billion in assets under management. They believe that their business model allows their principals, managers and employees to have input and make decisions, so you can get the service you deserve and the sophisticated advice you need.",Financial Services,1,Michael J Cleary,51-100,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
