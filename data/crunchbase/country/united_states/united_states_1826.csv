The firm differs from a recruitment firm because they work directly for the client/job candidate instead of working for an employer. Their hands-on approach is very comprehensive and the benefits they offer their clients are extensive, reaching beyond just getting the job. When a client first seeks out the Barrett Group, they do so because they are typically looking to either find a new career or change career paths. In the initial step (the Clarity ProgramÂ©) the Barrett Group reviews the clientâs needs and wants, explores who they really are and helps them clearly articulate their career goals. This process is often very enlightening for clients; many report that it helps them define their goals, find new motivation, focus, and drive. The Barret Group reviews each clientâs Clarity ProgramÂ© findings and then sets out to help the client discover the perfect position. When assisting the client for an upcoming interview, for example, the Barret Group has a team of expert negotiators that will prepare the clients for negotiating the best compensation plan for themselves. This team of experts is so phenomenally skilled in their field, that past clients have reported to have received offers that were tens of thousands of dollars higher than they would have been if it were not for the guidance they had received beforehand from the Barret Groupâs negotiation team. After landing the role in their current or new career path, a client continues to receive career management support from the Barrett Group. When there are performance reviews, clients can rest assured that they will be more than prepared for them and come out the other side with a top dollar raise or promotion thanks to the continued guidance from the Barrett Group.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
