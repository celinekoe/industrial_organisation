In our first year of operation, we recognized many industry myths and challenges associated with branding.  Agencies like to sequester the creative experience; manufacturing a mythical black box out of which, they promise, the most innovative, genius ideas emerge... Look, we think mystery is sexy too, but we’re more interested in taking stakeholders along the journey to optimize together and create a brand that is truly authentic.  Dakotomy’s mission is to operationalize brand through process and education. We work with companies at their foundational level to help mold a more authentic brand leading to faster, stronger, and more consistent communication.  Our job is to create a brand so strong and actionable that your employees can leverage each component for their functional role, and make the right decisions quickly and with more accuracy.  Your brand book will become your bible, and your company will sing the same harmonious tune, all aligned with your business goals and authentic identity.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment",1,Dexter Dake,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
