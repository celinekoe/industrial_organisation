GymnasticBodies gained traction after fitness enthusiasts emailed asking for more information. Since then, tens of thousands have benefited from Coach Sommer's 40 years as a USA Junior National Team coach. GymnasticBodies has allowed a whole new era of bodyweight training and culture to emerge and many students have succeeded in both their physical and professional lives. As GymnasticBodies' student base grew, so too did the resources available to them. Gymnasts are SuperheroesOriginally an ebook and DVD set, the curriculum has evolved into seminars and more than fifteen online courses, of which half have been published and the rest are in progress. Why such an overwhelming response? Olympian gymnasts have always been awed by their physiques and athleticism. Prior to GymnasticBodies, though, elite gymnastics remained completely isolated from the rest of society. Adults often assumed gymnasts who mastered ring strength, and other incredible feats were simply a lucky few who possessed 'the right stuff' to achieve such feats. In contrast to comic superheroes, they are built over time from ordinary people. They lacked the knowledge and training to take advantage of gymnastics' aesthetic and athletic potential. According to Coach Sommer, the ‘right stuff’ is not purely genetic, but rather a progressive, structured approach to fitness. A gymnastics program that bridges the lack of flexibility and strength of most adults with the possibilities of high-level gymnastics has adapted and scaled the conditioning that created hundreds of National, State, and Regional champions. With all these decades of expertise and success, you are uniquely positioned to benefit from them. To improve yourself, it is only necessary to work consistently.","Education, Health Care, Sports",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
