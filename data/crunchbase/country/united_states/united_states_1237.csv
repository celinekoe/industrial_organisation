","2,784,652","Great Lakes, Midwestern US",,Active,2015-01-01,day,,,,,For Profit,http://www.onlinefoodblog.com,"This amazing Food Blog is based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Thank you for reading our recipe food blog. We are an online based food blogging website with a special interest in creating unique recipes for our readers. The onlinefoodblog.com stated about ten years ago - with me reading vast quantities of food recipes online and purchasing cookbooks every time I visited a bookstore. I only started my own food blog 2 years ago as I was working full time at that stage. As you probably gathered I am bit obsessed with creating amazing recipes for my readers that is tasty and easy to make. I began loving food at the age of 16 while working at various food chains for extra spending money. At some stage I got a history lesson from some of the world class chefs about how different food groups combine to create a new taste. I also start to realise the difference between developing your own recipes from an existing recipe to just following the recipe that you read online or in a cookbook.  Food blogging is easy but only if you enjoy making food. Sitting hours behind a computer writing out various recipe ideas and then testing them can become choir if you don’t enjoy making food.   I do not consider myself a professional cook but rather a professional food recipe tester. I say this because I like to test different food options using an existing recipe. I would for instance not use salt in recipe but rather substitute it with seasoning that would give the recipe a different taste that may sometimes improve the recipe or totally ruin the whole thing. My food obsession includes dark chocolate and cookies. You will notice my preference when you read my food blog.","Content and Publishing, Food and Beverage, Media and Entertainment",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

No, it’s not a new sci-fi character, and it’s not an acronym. DEO is your personal shopper online. A plug-in for your browser that works with an app to make sure you never miss a deal.  Think of it this way. How many times have you been online and found the perfect pair of jeans? I mean, the look, the fit, the color—everything was perfect.  Yet, you didn’t know if the price was what you were willing to pay. So instead of pulling the trigger, you went back to that same site every day for a week. Checking the price each time, only to see it never moved. So you passed on the jeans.  Only to hear from your friendly, yet boastful neighbor, he got the jeans on a one-day sale. The one day, you didn’t look.  Well, DEO can help with that. You see DEO tracks your wish list items, constantly checking the price of not only the original site, but other sites that might have the same item.  Then it notifies you when the price drops. So you’ll never miss a deal again.  DEO also simplifies the buying procedure. A few simple clicks from your DEO app purchases the item you want, without having to return back to the website. So you can get those perfect jeans, right from the palm of your hand.  So how does DEO work? Well, it’s rather simple really. When you’re online shopping, simply right-click the item you want DEO to track. Scroll down to TRACK ITEM WITH DEO.  Then, all you have to do is answer a few questions.  Then you can sit back, while DEO does all the work for you.  When the price drops, DEO will notify you right on your phone. Simply open the app, click “Buy Now”--and boom--those jeans are yours.  But DEO doesn’t just track prices; it also gives you a price forecast. Based on a lot of mathematical stuff that we won’t bore you with, we’ll tell you the probability that the price of your item might drop.  And DEO doesn’t stop there, because we want to be more than an app, we want to be your friend. So like any good friend, we’ll suggest things we think you might like in our Recommendations section.  So you can stay on top of the trends in fashion, home décor, electronics. Just about anything by seeing other items that people bought on DEO in our Trending section. So next time you see your neighbor you’ll be the one boasting at what an amazing deal you found on those jeans. Deo. Never.
