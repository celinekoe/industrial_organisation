The dōbook enables each child to create their own identity by entering his or her name in a login screen. This feature has a dual purpose: engaging the child on a responsive level, while allowing the technical capabilities of the iOS platform to include the reader at various points within an adventure.

Products like Waste King Universal, Thermador and Sub-Zero soon achieved a significant market share. In 1985, Tim joined the firm as a sales representative, focused on developing Southwest and Central Florida markets. And in 1987, Michael, who is now the CEO, joined the team and quickly developed the North East coastal market. Changes in the distribution of appliances (and the rise of big-box retailers) forced us to think about how we would respond. It meant entry into a new market—kitchen and bath cabinetry—but we knew many of the key players and our reputation as the premier Manufacturer’s Rep Agency in Florida, made the transition smoother than we had expected. In the early years, we represented cabinetry from a number of manufacturers. But a wave of mergers and acquisitions meant that several of our product lines were now owned by MasterBrand Cabinets and eventually, we became an exclusive agency for MasterBrand (the world’s largest manufacturer of kitchen and bath cabinetry). MasterBrand is a division of Fortune Brands. Today we have 9 representatives serving the retail dealer, builder and home center markets and we are proud of the efforts of this team of top-tier professionals. Fifty years after we started, we are still here, still growing and still focused on our customers first.","Manufacturing, Other",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
