The product and procedures they use are top notch and the product is a tried and proven product by over 25+yrs by a strict company that I have contracted with to provide us with the battery chemicals to use for this service. Being an auto mechanic for over 15 yrs, I`ve decided to become an entrepreneur and life a healthy and debt free lifestyle for myself and family. Over the years, i was told that to open up my own garage and become free from the rat race. I`ve researched it many times over and seen the high costs and stress it will take to run my own garage. Rent, insurance, fees, taxes, equipment, etc., were out of my budget back then and now. But, after doing research on this product the last 2 years and alot of phone time and trying the product myself and on friends and family vehicles, it works no problem. But not with just the product, comes with procedures of testing the battery before and after, cleaning the battery, load testing, letting batteries sit for ""wait time"" and such. But, as of researching banks for loans and such, i`ve noticed that banks pretty much tell start up businesses NO without good credit and at least a year in business.. I have neither.. But am willing to work for what i want to get this going and do the research to get a ""hand"" in helping obtain a business vehicle and some business equipment to get the ball rolling and hit the ground running. But with 2 little girls and bills, its hard to save money to do what I need to do.
