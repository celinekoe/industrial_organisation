This fundamentally changes the users' relationship with money resulting in greater savings and the consistent achievement of goals. The app modernizes the outdated envelope budgeting system of previous generations by digitizing budgets into “qubes”.

This unique budgeting app helps consumers avoid overspending. When money in a qube is insufficient, shoppers are empowered to make in-the-moment budgeting choices about a purchase. The app is engineered to support a variety of budgeting dynamics in the household. Couples can choose Qube Companion Cards to strengthen financial transparency and keep open communication about shared budgets. Qube Money also offers an effective tool for families to track spending across different family members. With the help of Kid Cards, parents and children learn about responsible spending habits together.  FREEING people from the tyranny of money by breaking the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle and eliminating personal debt is the heart of Qube Money.

Clean.Tech was founded in 2017 by Robbie Lemos and Petr Brazdil, each having managed large technology teams at leading solar companies. The founders helped pioneer augmented reality-based solar automation within the U.S. Dept. of Energy’s incubator program. Their startup, Sunlayar, was later acquired by Sunnova. They believe that solar is currently a failed product. This is because, despite the high demand and associated cost savings of solar, total market penetration remains below 5%.  Clean.Tech believes a software-centered, “asset-light” business model that is focused on continuous design and process improvement will allow solar to finally achieve large-scale adoption. Clean.Tech uses A.I. and tools such as augmented reality to help buyers visualize solar systems on their roofs and make real-time adjustments to clearly understand the costs and benefits of going solar, which facilitates quick sales cycles. Residential buyers can also apply for 0% down, long-term financing from third-party lenders through Clean.Tech’s app usually within the same sales session as choosing a solar system. These innovations help buyers feel in control of their customer journey and reduce the friction that is typically associated with purchasing a solar system.  Similar to Uber, Clean.Tech uses software to bring together independent sales agents and certified, third-party installers into a process that is standardized with strong quality controls. This marketplace model allows Clean.Tech to keep fixed costs low, which in turn leads to high scalability and improved pricing for consumers. Unlike Uber, Clean.Tech does not need to subsidize the marketplace as there are already large pools of independent salespeople and installers who need work.   Clean.Tech uses its growing purchasing power to routinely negotiate better terms with its third-party partners and, in turn, offer better pricing to buyers of solar systems, further improving the buying experience versus competitors. Also, Clean.Tech manages a global workforce with compensation tied to revenue goals, which has kept costs relatively low and helps drive profitability.","Energy, Information Technology, Natural Resources, Software, Sustainability",1,Robbie Lemos,11-50,1,Seed,2000000,USD,2000000,2000000,USD,2000000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

We use millions of high-quality music samples to generate and deliver exclusive, royalty-free music using the power of AI. With a near-endless music library featuring more than 100 musical categories, users can search by genre, mood and activity to find the perfect song for their project. Mubert, a platform trusted by thousands of content creators and companies like Banuba, BetterMe, Sensorium, Adidas, InsightTimer, Restream, MacPaw and Crello, can help you find the music you need. Democratization of Creator Economy Our one-of-a-kind creator-centric platform utilizes AI to generate unlimited royalty-free music. Users can generate tracks on the go or search through a massive database of pre-made tracks to create highly personalized content. With a variety of license types, dynamic presets for streaming and over 1 million samples from more than 4,000 musicians, it is one of the most powerful and versatile music licensing platforms around. Stand Out From The Crowd – Music For Content Creators Content creators often struggle with sifting through thousands of stock audio tracks in search of the “perfect soundtrack.” Unfortunately, stock music never quite fits. Using YouTube tune library can be just as fruitless for the unique content creator, as many of these tracks have been used by millions of creators before. With Mubert, content creators gain access to real-time generative music and pre-made tracks, which they may Render with the genre, mood and length, allowing for more customization than ever before. The platform has more than 100 genres and a large selection of attributes, such as mood, tempo and genre, to help creators find the right music for their project fast. App creators enjoy the adaptive nature of Mubert’s music, which helps increase the in-app and in-game user experience. From casual Twitch and Youtube Streamers to app-building gurus, the platform provides unique, custom-made music with a single subscription. Music Without Strikes or Copyright Infringements Fears of copyright/DMCA claims and strikes can hinder a content creator’s ability to work freely. One mistake and hours of work could be tossed down the drain due to unexpected or unpredictable platform algorithms. People often end up dealing with stock websites that don’t have the correct license, websites with inaccurate license descriptions, licenses that don’t cover the necessary content, or licenses that aren’t available in all countries. When content creators use Mubert, they never have to worry about music licensing or confusing royalty agreements. The beauty of Mubert is that all of the music on our platform is royalty-free and available for use worldwide. Our licenses and sub-licenses are 100% DMCA-friendly and compatible with a number of platforms, i.e., YouTube, Twitch, Facebook and more. Plus, when you license music through Mubert, you get support from licensing professionals who can help you with any questions you might have! Empowering Artists With nominal commissions, hungry publishing companies and an unstable industry, artists often find it difficult to diversify their income. Here at Mubert, we understand the importance of artists, musicians and producers, which is why we collaborate with them using unique frameworks so that they can monetize their music. When artists work with Mubert, they receive a platform on which they can express themselves and earn real money on their work. When a content creator licenses music from Mubert, they are licensing high-quality, pro-level audio material made with the involvement of independent music producers.

The Mercator Projection effectively transformed navigation, making it possible for ships to deliver cargo safely to any port on the globe. Inspired by the spirit of our namesake, Mercator MedSystems has developed a medical technology that enables the safe and accurate delivery of therapies anywhere in the body, ranging from drugs for diseased blood vessels, to stem cells that regenerate ailing tissues and organs.
