Now, Trocaire College serves all students seeking an associate’s or occupation-specific certificates. Trocaire College focuses on career-specific programs, which range from business, dietetic technology, or computer networking to various certificates in the health service industry.  Because Trocaire College is committed to providing quality education to promising and dedicated students, the college has created a program called TOP, or Trocaire Opportunity Program. Students who qualify for TOP receive a financial aid package, which can sometimes cover all costs and give students a stipend. Students who receive TOP are required to attend a 5-week pre-freshman semester of preparatory courses, tutoring and field trips. These students are usually from low-income environments, with a low high school GPA.  Because Trocaire College is not a public two-year college, credits are not always easily transferable. That is why Trocaire College has signed agreements with four universities in the state of New York, allowing for easy transfers to the following schools: Bryant & Stratton, Daemen College, Hilbert College, and Niagara University.
