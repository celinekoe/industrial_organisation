Well, many people have that issue every day. Waiting is unacceptable. That is why we created Tabber to let people order and pay in restaurants with their own smartphones. Never try to get the attention of a waiter again, dine at your own pace without interruptions. After one year of development and testing, we were selected by a Miami-based startup accelerator to be in their 2013 class. That was an exciting recognition of our work and we decided to make Miami our home. After that, we refined the technology and the business and geared up for our official launch. In a nutshell, Tabber allows the users to find restaurants, browse their menus, place orders for dine-in or take-out and pay the tab. It cuts all the wait and provides a great experience for the client, while expediting operations for the restaurants and increasing revenue. Here is the kick: it is 100% free for the restaurants. No need for any new equipment or complex implementation, it is a self-service model. This translates into scalability. We will have our commercial launch at the Collision Conference in Las Vegas on May 13th. The US is our current target market, but we designed Tabber to be launched anywhere in the world with little effort.  Everything is in place, all we need now is to get an initial round of seed money to have strong sales and marketing. You can make all the difference right now - join us in making Tabber a huge success!","Commerce and Shopping, Financial Services, Food and Beverage, Mobile, Payments",2,"Ricardo Da Ros, Vinicius Perdigao",1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
