Manufacturing at our Taiwan facility, utilizes high end CNC processing equipment and other automated machinery for production, CAD for design, and computerized simulation software for designing connectors to accommodate special needs for our customer’s requirements ― and for creating some of what was impossible before. Work in process QC (WIP), third party QC (In Taiwan) prior-to-shipment, and then final QC once material arrives in the U.S. keeps our quality as one of the finest in the industry. Our mission is to provide most all standard series RF interconnect products in all standard configurations. Additionally, we take it a step further.
