Our strategies eliminate up to 65% of student loan debt, saving on average $49,000 and immediately lower monthly student loan payments up to 88%. ISLS generates revenue by charging fees to develop, implement and maintain the plans.  Loan Forgiveness Program Student loans are the primary option to cover the rising costs of post-secondary education. It is also a relatively painless process to obtain them. That is why the amount of student loans being borrowed has dramatically increased from 2004 to 2008, as the number of students that have borrowed at least $40,000 has almost doubled in just four years. Unfortunately, repaying the debt is not as easy as acquiring it. Changes to the Federal student loan program have eliminated most discounts that were being offered on interest rates or opportunities for reduction in the loan’s principal balance. In response to the increased growth in student loan debt, Congress passed the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 (CCRA). One of the provisions of the Act is the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program, which allows for qualified borrowers to have their Federal student loan balances to be forgiven. ISLS  has realized that many qualified borrowers are not taking advantage of these programs, and is dedicated to creating and implementing a customized strategy that maximizes the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. Our mission is to enable clients to continue their higher education and make pursuing those advanced degrees more affordable; reduce the overall student loan indebtedness (monthly payment and reduction of principal) and simplify a complicated government process for our clients.",Financial Services,,,11-50,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
