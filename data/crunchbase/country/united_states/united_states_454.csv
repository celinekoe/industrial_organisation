Mr. Distler came to this meeting following a successful career in New York at the investment banking firm of Warburg Pincus. Mr. Wishnick came to this same meeting following a career in real estate development and as a founding director of nearby First Washington State Bank which was founded in 1989.  Since that time, the initial incorporators (the initial investors) were identified and they provided the seed capital that became the basis for the creation of the bank. Subsequently and methodically the management team was identified and hired.  The investor group has grown from the initial 20 incorporators to 629 shareholders. The original $30 million of capital raised far exceeded the $6 million minimum threshold required by the New Jersey Department of Banking. This fundraising success is strong testimony to the considerable support the bank has in the local community. In 2010, MoreBank, a Korean based bank in Pennsylvania, was acquired by The Bank of Princeton. Combined with the three branches under the MoreBank division, we now have thirteen branches total in two states. Today, The Bank of Princeton team has grown from its beginnings with a team of 12 to over 125 employees led by Chairman Richard Gillespie. The Bank of Princeton is a growing, profitable community bank that was founded in Princeton, New Jersey in 2007. It is a New Jersey state-chartered commercial bank with ten branches in New Jersey, including three in Princeton and others in Hamilton, Pennington, Montgomery, Monroe Township, Lambertville, New Brunswick, Lawrenceville and three branches operating under the MoreBank name in the Philadelphia area.

ClinicsNow! enables millions of transactions each year by managing customers and their health data across the entire ecosystem; driving out fraud and friction to shorten the sales cycle. Customer Problem - Long sales cycles cause life insurers to lose customers. Each interaction increases the chance of customer attrition. Clinical data collection required to complete underwriting of life insurance applications is one of the biggest contributors to this attrition. Lastly, the current model for capturing that data, and the healthcare infrastructure which presently exists, are not equipped to effectively provide this service. Target Market - The life insurance industry is demanding more reliable applicant health data; needing it faster and in greater detail than ever before. Installing our ClinicsNow! IoS software at urgent care clinics across the US, we supply our customers with biometric examinations, customized services, medical histories and other risk-related data. We have two major carriers in contract negotiations and 200 clinics under exclusive contract; our target is 6,000. Business Model - Force Diagnostics charges transactional fees from life insurance carriers for the collection and transmission of policy applicant data. Our ClinicsNow! software is an Internet of Services (IoS) solution which connects thousands of urgent care centers into a single network; enabling our life insurance customers to rapidly access health data and accelerate their sales cycles. Servicing up to 15MM applicants per year ensures long-term value. Customer Segments - We are an insurance underwriting data services company. Annually, there are 15 million applications for individual life insurance policies. Customer segments are represented through agents (captive and independent), direct marketing, and online sales. Greater flexibility, lower fixed costs and speed of service delivery creates value, while the intense customer-service focus of the urgent care industry provides unique advantages to each segment. Sales & Marketing Strategy - Life insurance companies require health data to assess risk of policy applicants, and have been forced to rely on a fragmented independent contractor model which complicates the sales cycle. This industry is highly relationship driven. To acquire customers, we have hired respected industry professionals with established relationships. Demonstrating our ability to improve policy ""taken"" rates ensures customer retention. Competitors - Competitors follow an independent contractor model which provides limited control over the customer experience, unpredictable service availability and lack of flexibility. Major competitors, which all follow this model, include EMSI, Apps, and ExamOne. Barriers to entry include exclusive contracts with our clinic partners and a network-wide, installed-base of our ClinicsNow! software. Competitive Advantage - We leverage a customer-focused healthcare infrastructure to directly address pain points all life insurers are facing today; provided through a sophisticated nationwide network, which generates more accurate and complete clinical data, and reduces attrition caused by delay and negative experiences from the current model. Thus, our first-mover advantage is adapting the care-on-demand industry to the benefit of life insurance health data needs.","Financial Services, Health Care, Information Technology",6,"Dave Wickersham, Kim Anderson, Leonard Koloms, Ron Kleiman, Scott Filer, Tedd Determan",1-10,2,Early Stage Venture,1750000,USD,1750000,1750000,USD,1750000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Our mission is to democratize power and help small-dollar donors make their voices heard in a real way. We develop top-of-the-line fundraising software and offer simple, intuitive tools to help campaigns and organizations on the left connect with new and existing grassroots donors. As a result, Democratic campaigns get more donations through ActBlue than any other platform. Together, we build powerful movements. How do we make that happen? Well, first we test and retest our Contribution Forms to maximize conversion rates. We make it as easy as possible to give, no matter where the donor is, or on what device they’re using. And we make it free for campaigns and organizations — no tricks or add-ons. And with a top-notch tech team, our tools are always dependable, and we’re always working to upgrade them. That’s why a majority of Democratic Senate and House campaigns — along with the DCCC, DSCC, DGA, over one-third of statewide campaigns, and advocacy organizations around the country — have chosen ActBlue. But we’re so much more than a toolset. Together, we’ve raised $717,535,464 dollars for Democrats and progressives in just 10 years. We’ve built more than just a fundraising platform. We’ve created the kind of grassroots power that can take on, and beat back, the power of corporate spending and secretive super PACs. And that’s the difference that ActBlue makes to campaigns and the supporters who champion them. The fine print we’re willing to shout from the rooftops: ActBlue acts as a conduit federally and in most states, which means we provide the infrastructure for campaigns and organizations to fundraise online, but we don’t fundraise on behalf of anyone. Unlike groups that spend large sums of cash from undisclosed sources, ActBlue offers grassroots donors a way to give fully disclosed donations to the candidates and causes they choose.","Government and Military, Other, Social Impact, Software",2,"Ben Rahn, Matt DeBergalis",51-100,1,Early Stage Venture,22000000,USD,22000000,22000000,USD,22000000,IDG Capital,1,1,,Private,,,,,,

Like all great inventions, Uqora was created out of necessity. In 2014, Jenna Ryan had eight UTIs. If you get UTIs, then you understand how awful the cycle can be. Long waits at the doctor, constant anxiety, and system-crushing antibiotic cycles Jenna had tried all of the usual recommendations (proper hygiene, ineffective cranberry products, even low-level antibiotics) and was starting to feel stuck. This experience inspired Jenna (whose background is in technology) and her partner, Spencer Gordon (whose background is in biochemistry), to start researching solutions for effective, proactive urinary tract health. Built in collaboration with physicians and urologists and with the best clinical research available, Uqora was launched in 2017. The current suite of products includes three flagship products: Uqora Target, Uqora Control, and Uqora Promote. Each product holds a distinct function to flush the urinary tract, cleanse biofilm, and balance the vaginal microbiome (respectively). All products are manufactured in the USA and are formulated with ingredients found in nature.   Since its inception, Uqora has helped more than 75,000 people find a path to better urinary tract health. With over 5,000 five-star reviews, Uqora users frequently say that with Uqora, they’ve ‘gotten their life back’ and find Uqora’s products to be ’life-changing."" Uqora’s customers are glad to break free from the anxiety that can come with UTIs—plus the pain and inconvenience. Uqora has developed next-generation health products for proactive urinary tract care and continues to expand high-quality research on urinary tract health.
