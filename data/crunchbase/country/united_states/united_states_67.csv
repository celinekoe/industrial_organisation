For example, if someone posts a bounty for $10 asking how they can better manipulate their product or service, and thirty people answer, but five people did a much better job, they could give all $10 to the top response, or $2 to each of the top five depending on what they feel is most deserved.   Bountyit also has an easy to use freelance service section, where a poster puts up what they would like to be done or a service they can perform for an estimated cost.  People will then compete for the service bounties by describing why they would be fit for the job, as well as providing a profile with their resume, previous ratings, portfolio etc.  Once the cost is agreed upon, BountyItâ€:tm:s system ensures that no funds are released until both parties agree that the project has been completed,  which includes a built-in milestone management system for larger projects.
