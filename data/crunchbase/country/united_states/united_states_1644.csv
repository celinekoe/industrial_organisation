We do this by providing companies with a web-based dashboard and using their data to create AI-driven insights and engagement matches with a vetted consultant network. A problem worth solving:  It is hard to understand the health of your business.  Building and scaling a business isn’t easy; most business owners don’t know how to evaluate and benchmark their business comprehensively. It is hard to find and afford deep domain expertise. Even if business owners know where their business could perform better, it's hard to find and afford subject matter experts. Consulting is available, but it isn’t working for small and medium-sized businesses. Large consulting firms need to be within reach for small to mid-sized businesses.  Good fractional advisors are hard to find and come with significant performance risk.   The current online consulting marketplaces are a step forward, but don’t de-risk engaging a consultant.  Our Solution Sobo integrates with a company’s existing cloud-based financial, HR, and CRM applications to build a data profile of the business. We use this data profile to populate a dashboard that provides key metrics and peer benchmarking for company management. This data is also available on an anonymous basis to our vetted network of consultants to perform a brief assessment and recommendation, which we term “Insights.”  These Insights can be done proactively by the consultant at the company's request. Over time, these Insights will migrate to an AI predictive model. These Insights will prompt companies to request a consultant “match.” We will facilitate a successful consulting engagement through scoping, benchmarking, and assurance.","Advertising, Information Technology, Media and Entertainment, Professional Services, Sales and Marketing",2,"Frank Lazaro, Robert Burke",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
