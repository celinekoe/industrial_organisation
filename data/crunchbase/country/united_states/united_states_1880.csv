Veterans of the worlds of style and magazine editorial, they founded CAP Beauty with a mission to merge the worlds of wellness and design. Kerrilynn’s first business, the clothing and accessories store Castor & Pollux, was a much-loved fixture in NYC’s West Village and might be considered the seed for CAP Beauty. Kerrilynn introduced natural beauty to her customers in 2010 and watched the interest and love for this category grow. She herself became enthralled and was amazed there was no single destination where she could shop for the newest and most exciting natural brands. She decided at that point that New York City (and the world!) needed a store committed to natural beauty, a store stocked exclusively with naturals, where customers could experience and learn about these amazing products through treatments, testing, and conversation. Kerrilynn partnered with her longtime friend and collaborator, the photo stylist Cindy DiPrima, a perfect match as they had bonded for so long over their interest in healthful living. Known for her intelligent and elevated approach to style, Cindy has contributed to Harper's Bazaar, Domino, and Town & Country among other publications. As two style-obsessed friends, they dreamed of building a brand that would deliver naturals in the most inspired and edited way. With a heavy focus on design and sensibility and a deep passion for healthful beauty, Kerrilynn and Cindy offer you CAP Beauty.",Commerce and Shopping,2,"Cindy DiPrima, Kerrilynn Pamer",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
