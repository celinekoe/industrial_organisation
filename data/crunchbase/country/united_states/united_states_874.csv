Between us, they have extensive experience developing original and work-for-hire titles using various technologies including Unity, Java, Objective C, C++ and their own native engine. Their first game, Little Chomp was selected as one six featured titles at the 2013 PAX East Indie Showcase and has received some extremely flattering press, including an 8/10 from IGN and a 4.5/5 from Touch Arcade. But it hasn’t been all rainbows and unicorns for their team of intrepid founders. The company was founded in 2012, when the studio they’d all been working for was unceremoniously downsized.  At the time, it was the only major game studio in Portland so they were left with few options.  They could change careers, they could all move to cities with better job prospects in gaming, or they could stand their ground and fight to rebuild their studio here in Portland.  Without hesitation, they opted for what was behind curtain number three and ClutchPlay Games was born. In 2013, ClutchPlay became one of six companies selected by the Portland Development Commission for the PDX Startup Challenge, which was a program designed to nurture promising startups in the City of Portland.  They were truly honored by the vote of confidence from their hometown and are deeply committed to making their city proud.","Gaming, Mobile, Platforms, Software",1,Amy Dallas,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
