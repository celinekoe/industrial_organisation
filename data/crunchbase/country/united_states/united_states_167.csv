Over 80% of e-commerce shoppers go straight to the online store's search box or product navigation links.  Shoppers of course gravitate to e-commerce sites that help them quickly find what they seek, and every 1/10 second of load time means a 1% decrease in conversions.  Our product helps merchants reduce site abandonment; increase conversions; decrease SEO bounce rates; enhance customer retention.  Our service:  Until now, most existing solutions required expensive licenses or contracts to access features such as fast-indexing search servers, multi-select faceting, and auto-complete/auto-suggest.  StackSearch provides these features as a subscription that is priced within reach of the 86% of online merchants that now use sub-optimal search functions that are bundled with their e-commerce platform.  Most of these sub-optimal solutions are based on slow technology that is simply not built for today’s environment of cheap compute instances/bandwidth.  StackSearch is built specifically for today's e-commerce environment.  Our market: The global e-commerce will exceed $1.25T in 2013 and is growing 20% per year.  We reside in the e-commerce tools market, which is a $12B market where cloud solutions are steadily grabbing more of this market. Our addressable market is the segment that books $1-50M in annual sales (approx. 25% of online stores).

Their thriving publication covers everything Redmond, including city government, important school issues, the vibrant arts and entertainment scene, the growing business district and action-packed sporting events. But most important, they feature the residents who shape this community. Former publisher Denis Law launched the Redmond Reporter in 2001 as a monthly publication. The Redmond Reporter was an immediate favorite with both the readers and advertisers and expanded to bimonthly in January 2002. The Redmond Reporter continued to grow and now is delivered to Redmond homes every Friday, providing its readers with more of the quality journalism they enjoy. The instant growth shows that readers appreciate the local coverage and advertising provided by the Redmond Reporter's hard-working staff. Redmond is located about 15 miles east of Seattle between Washington's majestic Cascade mountain range and the Puget Sound. With 34 parks, including King County's popular Marymoor Park, and over 25 miles of trails, Redmond is known for its natural beauty. In addition, Redmond enjoys a diverse and growing business district. The community is home to some of the major high-tech firms in the country, including Microsoft, and Nintendo of America. Redmond is also the headquarters of such businesses as Eddie Bauer and Genie Industries. Redmond's strong retail sector is anchored by Redmond Town Center, a 1.4 million square foot mixed-use development that includes retail stores, restaurants, and commercial offices. From an original incorporated area of three square blocks, the city has expanded to its present size of over 16.6 square miles. Redmond is led by Mayor John Marchione, who has lived in Redmond since age 4. As Redmond moves forward, the challenge will be to welcome Redmond's inevitable growth while preserving Redmond's rich heritage, Marchione said shortly after taking office in January. ""I'm very passionate about Redmond and very hopeful that Redmond can continue improving as a city that is sustainable and livable,"" he said.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
