Neal and his partner, Scott Mayster, sold Tick Data to Penson Worldwide, Inc. in January 2005. Penson made Tick Data a division of their technology subsidiary, Nexa Technologies, Inc., a provider of online and direct access trading platforms and electronic order routing solutions. Neal and Scott continue to manage Tick Data with a team of sales, support, and development experts who specialize in market data.
