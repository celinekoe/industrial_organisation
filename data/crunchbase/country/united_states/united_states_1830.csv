We provide reliable, portable, affordable sharing power banks all over the world by locating our charging stations (kiosks) in different kind of venues (restaurants, karaokes, nightclubs, bars, etc). Our main business model is collecting revenue from powerbank rentals. Customers can use our App or WeChat to scan the QR code on the kiosks and rent a portable powerbank. The renting price differs among venues. At present, we charge customer $1 for restaurants and $2 for karaokes & nightclubs in New York (Maximum $10 per day). Also, we will profit from advertising business (kiosks, social media and app) in future since we are the first company in shared powerbank industry that has a screen on the kiosks. Our operating areas now cover New York City, Boston, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Vancouver and Sydney. Our business is trying to solve the problem that phones are becoming necessary to everyone and people nowadays easily run out of phone battery. We will provide such kind of service that makes customers no longer get anxious about low battery phones. We have more than 15 competitors all around the world now. Most of them are in East Asia/South East Asia since that’s the origin of this type of business and all the products are manufactured there. Except competitors in the US, all other competitors have a similar business model to ours. Some of them got huge investment such as Enmonster/Laidian/Xiaodian in China and ChargeSpot in Hongkong/Japan. Competitors in the US are running a different kind of business model by selling charger or locating phone in a secured box to charge, which is not prevalent in leading market. Our clients can be separated into Consumers and Business entities. For consumers, we targeted on those people who would easily running out of phone battery. According to our research, most phones can only last for less than 8 hours after a one-time charge, which means most people have a demand of charger in the evening. For business entities, we targeted on those venues who want to have extra income and better customer service since we will share the revenue with our partner venues. Companies who want to advertise on our screen are our clients as well. Our current operating status is that we have existing product and service. After 4 months’ operation from March 2019, we find the business model works pretty good in the US market and we are even more profitable than Asian companies since our breakeven time for our kiosks (2 weeks for top venues and 6 month for restaurants) is way shorter than that in Asian market. Therefore, we try to expand the business into US market as soon as possible with around $7 million investment to get more market share.","Apps, Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Other, Software",5,"Hao Zhang, Pengqian Ma, Quanda Wan, Yi Huang, Ze Yu",1-10,2,Seed,1050000,USD,1050000,1050000,USD,1050000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

In a world dominated by cookie-cutter clones the evil forces of McFashion spread it’s awful agenda throughout the universe. The masses lived in a dark and bland world of predictability and boredom. The culture had been contaminated and Individual style was nonexistent. This was not to stand in the year of our ‘Loop 2000, a beacon of hope flashed from the Northeast guided by an intrepid entrepreneur and his rebel alliance of culturists who rose to battle the evil forces of McFashion. They set out to create a lifestyle brand...something that was more than just an e-commerce site but also a community of style and a full-fledged media powerhouse! The leader who emerged was Greg Selkoe and his rebel army was to be known throughout the universes as Karmaloop. And with your help as well as that from reinforcements worldwide over the past decade, the rebels have beat back the clones and McFashion’s empire has been crumbling under the weight of individuality ever since! It started, like many revolutions, in the underground. A basement to be more specific - Greg’s parents basement to be exact. While hundreds upon thousands of dot.com ventures began to disintegrate, Karmaloop ignored doubts, attacks and negativity (“The Internet?! Ha! You'll never make money off the Internet!”) after that moving operations to a dilapidated piano factory run by a lunatic landlord... and subsequently chasing out crackheads busting in the office, grinding for low or no money while working other “day jobs,” dealing with floods, theft, and fraudsters, engaging in drinking binges and making numerous trips to New York on the Fung Wah Bus aka “the Chicken Run”. All of it to get the gear you really wanted into your closet and concrete culture into your mind. Yet through it all Karmaloop never lost faith for one good reason...cause you had their back. Against all odds, the rebels weathered the battles and became true dot.com survivors. They have moved a couple times since (more crazy landlords, however) and now employ roughly 130 20 and 30-somethings that run Karmaloop in offices in Boston, NY, and LA. They don’t just work for Karmaloop, they live the culture, and it is with that dedication and loyalty (and of course the best customers in the world) that the site has grown into the cultural force Karmaloop is today. Karmaloop consists of: Karmaloop.com with over 300 clothing brands for Guys and Ladies, Karmaloop Kazbah Karmaloop’s market place for select up and coming brands, Karmaloop contests, Karmaloop blogs, Karmaloop music, Karmaloop Look Books, Karmaloop Rep Program, PLNDR.com a private flash sale site, KarmaloopTV.com, Buyer Wire Klickable Video, and coming later in 2011 Boylston Trading Co. exclusive street fashion and custom collabs, and KARMALOOP TV Multi-Platform the first cable channel for Verge Culture.... Celebrating the convergence of underground fashion, music, art, and entertainment! Without the incredible support from their family, friends and partners Karmaloop simply would not exist. But once again the most important key to Karmaloop’s existence is you, the customers and viewers, that has never doubted, spread the word and showed patience. When there were screw ups you understood and you gave love when things were done well - for this the Karmaloop fam will be eternally grateful! Karmaloop pledges to keep killing shit from now until eternity! If you ever need the CEO, Founder, and Owner Greg Selkoe this is his cell phone # 617-216-1013 and this is his email ges@karmaloop.com.

Since its incorporation, the Company has focused substantially all of its time and resources on activities relating to capital raising, content development, app development, and the acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of each of the following three (3) entities; (i) DigiTrax Entertainment, LLC (“DigiTrax”), a streaming media company that created high-quality, sought-after interactive music and artificial intelligence for apps, video, karaoke, games, TV, film, and animation with approximately $1M of unaudited revenues for the year ending 2019, with assets generally consisting of a recording studio and multimedia equipment, (ii) World Wide Digital Entertainment, LLC, whose assets generally consisted of an 11,000+ song Master Music Catalog, and (iii) Exomens, LTD (UK), a European-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) software company specializing in music creation, whose assets generally consisted of seven (7) patents and/or patents pending relating to its AI Software. Company Technology Today January 2024 The Company produces and distributes high-quality digital, interactive karaoke music from its proprietary 18,000+ song music catalog which has an asset value of $9 + million.  The Company’s digital streaming delivery platform, the Karaoke Cloud, Karaoke Cloud API, and Karaoke On Demand are able to deliver the Company’s proprietary 18,000+ karaoke song library, presently delivering songs to consumers and professional karaoke DJ customers around the world.  The Karaoke Cloud digital platform has the capability to deliver streaming karaoke music-video to apps on iPhones, iPads, Apple TV, Roku, Fire TV, and Android smartphones and tablets, as well as to desktop computers on major browser platforms.  Additionally, the Company has created its first AI user interfaces, the KR38R app, and KR38R Pro DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) plug-in. Both user interfaces integrate our Artificial Intelligence (AI) brain, The Music Builder. The Company believes that its KR38R Pro plug-in software and the KR38R app will disrupt and transform the music production industry. There are over 100 million DAWs in use worldwide and over 1.6 billion phone users who create and post short-form videos and need music. We are providing AI-produced Hip-Hop and Pop music which accounts for over 40% of the music market. Presently 600 million hours of short-form video are viewed daily. When broken down into 15-second clips, this represents over 24 Billion videos daily, all of which need music. We believe our KR38R app will dominate in the market. KR38R VOICE brings generative AI technology to music production, allowing users to create a model that is a digital copy of their own voice. Users can then use their voice model to sing songs from a catalog of licensed hit music without singing a word.   KR38R VOICE is built for singing voice conversion.  This deep learning process requires the computer to create a model based on learning how a person pronounces phonemes, syllables, and words.  At a high level, the input audio is broken down into frequency bands so the computer can analyze the distinct characteristics which make up a person’s voice, such as raspiness and breathiness. The resulting model is then optimized for direct pitch-to-pitch conversion where the desired output voice will sing the same notes and words as the input voice.  The KR38R VOICE offers all the chart-topping tunes to put your voice model on, currently offering the top ten TikTok hit songs to rearrange and remix with the power of AI. [Important Note: We only offer licensed music.] KR38R  VOICE is available at https://www.kr38r.com/voice Summary Over the past six years, the Company has produced interactive music videos for karaoke and play-along, built an Apple TV and iOS app for KaraokeOnDemand, Karaoke Cloud, and Karaoke Cloud Pro - a subscription service for professional DJs and karaoke hosts, and an award-winning YouTube Channel with over 80 thousand subscribers. We record exclusively for the Fender Guitar app, and we record for Yamaha Disklavier player pianos. The Company has been granted seven (7) AI-based patents, and developed the Music Builder Brain, the Music Fact Reports - a comparative copyright analysis platform, and the soon-to-be-released KR38R app and the KR38R Pro DAW plugin which the Company believes will dominate the short-form video arena, and disrupt and transform music forever.  The Company believes the  KR38R PRO  app will be a  major force in generating revenue for the music industry and become the standard for the way music is created, produced, and enjoyed.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Data and Analytics, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio, Other, Science and Engineering, Software",1,Joseph Vangieri,1-10,1,Seed,2000000,USD,2000000,2000000,USD,2000000,,,,2,Private,,,,,,

We work with the world’s largest financial institutions, peer-to-peer marketplaces, marketers and employers. Our Instant Trust rating service is designed to fill a “trust gap” caused by the speed of modern commerce and community, which requires instant evaluation of potential reward and risk – without the trust-building interaction history and feedback loops that people use to evaluate relationships offline. Our machine learning technology synthesizes digital footprints in real time to provide rich insight — well beyond old-school background checks, credit scores and risk management tools. Instant Trust ratings require minimal customer data input and cost less than $1 per query, with ratings and supporting evidence returned in roughly 30 seconds. Trooly’s predictive power has been demonstrated to be at least twice as effective as background checks, credit checks or database profiles in determining trustworthiness of individuals and businesses. Trooly operates as a consumer reporting agency, using only public and permissible information from online and offline sources. We respect and comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act in the United States.
