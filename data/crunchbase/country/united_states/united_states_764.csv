No questionnaires. No interviews. No tests. All is run by machine using data science, machine learning, deep learning, and AI techniques. PYCO has basically operationalized the 100-year-old psychology work, the work of eminent thinkers in the field of psychology like Carl Jung and Abraham Maslow. Carl Jung was a pioneering psychologist in the development of the concept of psychological or personality typing. The concept of psychological or personality typing was then expanded on by Isabel Briggs Myers with the creation of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). Personality psychology is a branch of psychology in academia. IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER The business landscape has changed. Customers are not only more difficult to acquire, keep, and grow, but also much harder to please, engage, connect, communicate, and build relationship with than ever before. Customers also own the relationship—not the company. Business success today requires a new depth of customer insight—an insight that is beyond any demographic, buyer, interest, financial, and lifestyle data. That insight is personality. Personality is the root of all behaviors, feelings, attitudes, desires, and needs. Personality is the piece that makes us unique. You use personality information to engage, connect, communicate, sell, and build relationship with customers. Keep in mind, we today can no longer think in terms of transactions, we think in terms of relationships. PYCO data assist you in understanding your customers in a way that can help you forge a strong and trusting relationship with them.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Sales and Marketing, Science and Engineering, Software",1,Yen Lee,1-10,1,,345000,USD,345000,345000,USD,345000,,,,,Private,,,,,,
