After the first 40-50 sales, Josh knew he could not only continue to sell these hats, but also find a way to give back with this thing he had started.  Acting on the one-for-one model, made famous by TOMS, Josh and friends donated 50 beanies to Detroit Christian Services homelessness outreach center in February of 2013.  Upon partnering with PB&J Outreach in March of 2013, the York team quickly learned that there was not as great of a need for beanies for the homeless as there was for socks, toilet paper, gloves, and underwear.  The team quickly switched the giving model to include these items as donations, instead of just beanies.  Currently, York Project makes a Donation Kit to donate for each product sold. Each one of these Donation Kits includes a durable tote bag, toilet paper, socks, and bottled water.

The corporation was formed in 1920 in the consolidation of several chemical manufacturers. By 1928, Allied became the leading producer of ammonia in the world with the opening of its plant near Hopewell, Virginia. Post World War II, Allied continued to venture into new markets with the production of nylon 6 (used in manufacturing items from tires to clothing) and refrigerants. In 1958, Allied Chemical & Dye Corporation moved its headquarters to Morristown, New Jersey where it was renamed Allied Chemical Corporation. In the 1940s these companies were transformed into divisions of Allied Chemical. There were further reorganizations and acquisitions of companies and plants during the 1950s, ’60s, and ’70s, and Allied became a conglomerate. Taking the name Allied Corporation in 1981, the firm acquired the Bendix Corporation, a manufacturer of automotive and aerospace equipment, in 1983.  Known as Allied-Signal in 1985, Allied expanded its aerospace, automotive, and engineered materials businesses through its merger with the Signal Companies. In 1993 the hyphen was dropped from the company’s name to convey a one-company image. In 1986 Allied-Signal spun off about 35 of its diverse subsidiary operations into a new and separate company so that the parent corporation, renamed AlliedSignal in 1993, could concentrate on its growing aerospace electronics and automotive operations.  In 1999, AlliedSignal acquired Honeywell—an international controls company that developed and supplied advanced technology products, systems, and services to aviation and space companies and industry—and adopted its name which it considered to be more recognizable. This merger was valued at $15 billion.  Today, with headquarters in Morristown, New Jersey and over 122,000 employees worldwide, Honeywell is organized into four major business units: aerospace, automation and control solutions, transportation systems, and specialty materials.","Manufacturing, Professional Services, Science and Engineering, Transportation",,,10001+,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
