With over 5,000,000 square feet of commercial space located throughout Northern California and primarily in the Central Valley, Ethan Conrad Properties also has over 100 employees to help manage a multitude of shopping centers and office and industrial parks. Operating Strategy The company’s philosophy with regard to leasing space in its buildings is simple: 1) create attractive/functional buildings and maintaining them properly and 2) Price the space very competitively. The combination of good looking, well maintained properties and competitive pricing has been pivotal in achieving occupancy rates that are consistently over 90%. At Ethan Conrad Properties, Inc., we buy properties at great prices because they are perceived to have issues that may make it difficult to lease them. By using our core competencies, we are able to transform these problems into opportunities for success. Here are the core competencies that make this strategy work: We have our own construction team to repair and remodel our buildings.  We control our construction costs better than any of our competitors while also adding significant value to our properties. All of our commercial real estate is managed by an in-house property management team.  This allows us to maintain our properties at a very high standard while simultaneously controlling our costs. We also have an in-house brokerage team to address our leasing and occupancy better than our competitors. By purchasing our properties at the lowest prices, repairing/remodeling our buildings at the lowest possible costs, and managing/leasing our own properties, we are able to minimize our costs and maximize our earning potential. These principles are the driving force behind the company’s continued growth and success.",Real Estate,,,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Our passion is caring for frail, elderly complex patients, – particulary the highest-needs, highest-cost segment of the senior population; however, we are always happy to care for uncomplicated patients age 3 and up, in their home or place of business, or to help a person visiting for pleasure of busines from out of town who gets sick while staying in a friend’s home or hotel room. We are the largest and most successful physician home visit practice in the country, and were honored to be 1 of only 18 practices nationwide selected to participate in Medicare’s groundbreaking Independence At Home Demonstration Program based on our practice’s reputation for having pioneered the practice model, and the sophistication of our electronic medical records and cloud-based practice management systems. DMH brings the best medical care into the most convenient, comfortable and lowest cost place of service – our patient’s home or business environment.  Our pioneering practice has transformed the “old-fashioned house call” into a 21st century phenomenon, by providing comprehensive, state-of-the-art care 7 days a week, as well as urgent care with same-day or next-day appointments.  We also have a number of subspecialists in our group who provide our primary care clinicians with consultations in palliative care, psychiatry, endocrinology, rheumatology pulmonary and intensive care medicine, podiatry, wound care, and pain management. Thanks to our patient-centerd philosophy of care, sophisticated technology, multi-dimensional delivery system, and close partnership with key resources in the communities we serve, we are able to  perform more tests and procedures in our patient’s home or place of business than most primary care physicians perform in their office.  And our service is surprisingly affordable because we contract with every insurance company, and are “in network” with nearly every plan.  We also file all the paperwork for our patients. Next time you find yourself waiting interminably for an appointment or languishing in a doctor’s office, urgent care clinic, or emergency room, worrying about exposure to other sick people not to mention the bill you’re going to receive for care that is not a true emergencyy, please remember – there is a better way!  DMH offers prompt appointments in the comfort of your own home or business, for any medical condition except life-threatening emergencies.  We come to you when and where you need us, so you’ll get the right care, in the right place, at the right time — and never have to wait in a doctor’s office again.
