They maximize contact with the appropriate estate representatives, such as the personal representative or estate attorney, while eliminating unnecessary contact with survivors of the deceased account holder. - DCM Services' approach to account recoveries honors the intentions of the decedent who, while alive, set aside funds in an estate to pay creditors after his or her death, without bother to survivors. - And finally, though claims against probated estates have longer liquidation cycles than non probated estates, probate claims can liquidate at rates substantially higher than non-probated estates and can represent a significant share of recoveries.","Financial Services, Professional Services",,,101-250,1,M&A,,USD,,,USD,,Norwest Equity Partners (NEP),,1,,Private,,,,,,

Thermal energy is collected from sources such as industrial exhaust stacks, stationary power generators, and thermal pollution control equipment, which each emit hot gas with temperatures up to 700°C. The thermal energy is collected from these gas streams and used by the ThermoHeart® Engines to generate electrical power. Producing up to 25 kilowatts of clean electricity from each module, the ThermoHeart Engines are quiet, low-maintenance, and extremely efficient. In initial performance testing, a 320° Celsius temperature difference produced nearly 30% conversion efficiency.   In addition, renewable electricity production such as biomass power and solar thermal power can use the ThermoHeart® Engines as the conversion core of their systems. Based around the 200-year-old concept of a Stirling cycle, the ThermoHeart® Engine brings modern techniques to bear: advanced computer optimization, self-lubricating seals, high-surface-area heat exchangers, sealed bearings, and a novel engine architecture. With a highly-capable contract manufacturing partner, commercial shipments to qualified customers begin in 2018.","Consumer Electronics, Energy, Hardware, Manufacturing, Natural Resources, Other, Sustainability",1,Samuel P.

Two years later, he expanded the company and entered a new line of business by acquiring the Pilatus maintenance and airline handling operations in Zurich and Geneva. Then realizing that customers may likely still require transport while their own aircraft are being maintained, he also began offering aircraft charter and management services to European and Middle Eastern customers. During the 1970s, Jet Aviation started opening facilities abroad, beginning with a maintenance facility in Germany and an FBO in Jeddah. In 1977, it began offering completions and refurbishment services at Basel, completing its first ever V.I.P.-outfitted aircraft – a Convair 880M — that same year. Today, Jet Aviation Basel is one of the largest independent completions center in the world. Continuing its expansion in Europe and the Middle East throughout the 1980s, Jet Aviation also successfully entered the U.S. market, making it the first global player in the business aviation industry. Consolidation and steady growth marked the 1990s, with the opening of a maintenance and FBO facility in Singapore in 1995 and an aircraft management and charter firm in Hong Kong, China in 2000. As pioneers of private business aviation, the Hirschman family built Jet Aviation up over nearly 40 years from a small local maintenance operation to a highly reputed global business aviation services provider, before deciding to sell the family-run business to Permira Funds, a private European equity firm, in 2005. Three years later, Permira sold Jet Aviation to General Dynamics on November 5, 2008.

Our focus is to prevent data leaks at the hands of trusted users such as employees, partners, customers, vendors, suppliers and friends.

Once the native file is converted to .paw file, only authorized users can access the information at authorized location for permitted duration as per the usage policy with complete audit trail. pawaaFILE is unique and disruptive.

We have also developed our own product based on our own technology called pawaaSHARE.   The most exciting application is pawaaDOCS - which is the Google Apps integration.
