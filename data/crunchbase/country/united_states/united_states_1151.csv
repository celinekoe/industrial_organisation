It will be concentrating on corporate identity of established companies and anyone in need of a design. We will offer customers a unique perspective regarding identity and visual communication. Most design Websites come solely from creative backgrounds .While this is useful for the crafting of logos and other devices of visual communication, This competitive edge allows my website to bring both an aesthetic design focus as well as a practical, quantitative mindset that adds value to the service offerings. This is useful since the customers are more business oriented.This company will rapidly grow its customer base by providing customers with well-priced projects due to reasonably low overhead, creative, practical designs that add more value than competing graphical  art firms, and superior customer attention The reason for our need of funds from an investor is to increase exposure by marketing and advertising, once we get the exposure we need for the site then we will be one of the largest graphic design websites on the web. Market Growth: In 2011 the graphic design industry reached $ 14 billion dollars. It is forecasted to grow at 0.5% for the next five years. This growth is attributed to companies' desire to appear professionally to the public.  Another related aspect of this trend is the formation of many small business owners that took their business, or created a business that uses the Internet and their desire to appear more corporate or established than they really are.

Trainees are given knowledge then immediately asked to apply that knowledge to a task or situation in the virtual environment. The application of the knowledge often requires hazard recognition and decision-making skills to complete. Computer-based training simulations offer a first-person perspective similar to that used in many video games and allow trainees to observe, experience and interact with a world similar to the one in which they will be working. The virtual training environment provides learners with a context for what they are learning and contributes to higher retention and better understanding. With this approach, CTS helps companies improve safety and decrease the total cost of training. The training modules also have the unique ability to capture behavioral data that can help predict a trainee's probability of being involved in an accident.

The inspiration behind this new initiative is quite simple, as exemplified by the tagline: ""Just show me the suggestion"". Save me time searching through comments and recommendations and just post visual suggestions under my requests; the exact picture and link of the product being suggested. How many times you feel that you know what your need is, but don't know what specific product or model you should buy? Like me you might have been in a situation where you know that you need a backpack or camera, but what model or brand to pick, you've no idea. So like most of us you either google or go to review sites to read all the comments and recommendations left by other users. You can search through page after page hoping for that golden suggestion. Wouldn't it be nice if you put your request for what you are looking for with your personal requirements of price range, color etc., and next time you see suggestions right under your request. But suggestions are not just comments but visual pictures of suggestions and with links where you can buy them. Now that's a real time saving, non-ambiguous help appreciated especially by non-techies. What does product do? 1. Friendly interface to easily post requests and receive visual suggestions. 2. Users can search products, create Wish lists 2. Add products from external sites to your list and suggest products to user queries. 3. Rate suggestions: Friendly interface to rate member suggestions (digg style) for a request, indicating in their view which suggestion matches the requested needs. 4. Suggestion Gurus: If a requester feels that someone has made a great suggestion, he/she can award suggestion stars. This determines who becomes a suggestion guru in a particular category. 5. Social networking - connect with like minded people and make friends. Mini feed to follow your friends or suggestion gurus. iShopWiser (founded by ex-telecom engineer) is a social shopping community that harnesses the power of social networking to bring answers to users shopping questions. How is it different from other social shopping sites? No need to search through comments, reviews and recommendations to guess what product might work for you. Instead get user rated suggestions with recommendations just for your specific request.","Commerce and Shopping, Software",1,Vinod Bhardwaj,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
