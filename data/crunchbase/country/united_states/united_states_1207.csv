In the past, listeners had platforms like radio and MTV to help sort through the noise and quickly get to what’s good, but they still haven’t found the new music discovery platform of tomorrow. That’s where fanum.fm steps in. fanum.fm gives everyone the opportunity to participate in the “Tastemaking” process, using a unique structure that recognizes Tastemakers for finding artists early on and utilizing their influence to build artists’ careers. Their platform rewards these dedicated fans based on how successful their artists become. They are tying a Tastemaker’s success directly to the success of the artists he or she chooses. With an unlimited number of “Likes”, “+1’s”, and “Favorites,” users of other platforms are currently not encouraged to be thoughtful about the choices they make. Although they now have access to endless amounts of new music, it’s harder than ever to distinguish quality content when it’s drowned out by all the chatter and noise. By limiting the number of artists a Tastemaker can like per month, they have presented Tastemakers' selections in a digestible form so that their online profiles can clearly communicate what they really like.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

This industry continues to enjoy a 4.9% annual growth rate since 2006. What [CRI] finds so exciting is that no company has more than a 5% market share. This makes the credit repair industry prime for startup opportunities. The primary opportunity lies with over 25% of the US population having average to poor credit. Poor credit is represented by a fico score below 600. This is costing the consumer higher interest loans on housing, autos, credit card and insurance payments. Poor credit can even result in lower wages, underemployment, and total missed job opportunities. The cause of bad credit can be very complex. Real life circumstances such as divorce, loss of job, illness and death are contributing factors, however the solution is simple. [CRI] will provide over 40 years of combined credit restoration experience compiled with state of the art software we will help almost anyone reinvent and improve their credit score and rating. The result is hundreds and thousands of dollars in savings and lower interest rate loans, while giving CRI customer’s competitive edge in the employment market. The key to successful credit restoration is not only understanding the applicable laws but how they are used in the scoring model. After spending over a combined 40 years in the mortgage, finance and related industry, the principals of CRI understand and have a passion to help people reinvent themselves and improve their financial health. Years have been spent turning the consumer down for home, auto, household’s goods and other basic necessities. Now it is time for [CRI] to use their skills, knowledge, relationships and experience to Re-Invent the consumer.
