It was founded in 2004 by three Dallas executives; Jay Martin, Phil Miller and David Micek. Jay Martin is a former Strategy and Supply Chain Consultant who worked for Arthur D.Little, IBM and Pepsico. Phil Miller is a Dallas-based Financial Executive and former CFO. David Micek has been a CEO of multiple companies, and was also the President of internet leader AltaVista. In 2004, JobSerf was the first company to demonstrate the feasibility of job search outsourcing, and the pioneer in the job search outsourcing industry. JobSerf takes the work of searching for and applying to jobs on employment websites such as Craigslist or Careerbuilder and outsources these tasks to offshore resources.[2]  By doing this, users of the service are able to apply to many more jobs much faster than if they were doing it themselves. This can help them to free up time to go on interviews, keep working their day jobs, or to apply to even more jobs and supplement the service. In general, the types of service that JSO's provide include general information (e.g. book, articles), customized or tailored advice (e.g. coaching, profile specific information) and tools (e.g. products and services which facilitate easier or more effective job searching by the candidate). Companies like JobSerf take ownership and complete the execution of the task of online job searching. For the first stage of a job search, a resume writer is a good comparison. The job seeker passes information (or an initial draft) to the writer, and the writer completes the job seekerâ€™s resume (and cover letters) versus providing them with advice or tools.","Administrative Services, Internet Services, Professional Services",,,11-50,1,Seed,300000,USD,300000,300000,USD,300000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The result was a new kind of newswire that targets the media contacts most likely to be interested in your news. Better targeting means journalists trust ReleaseWire to deliver the right kind of news releases, when and how they want to read them. Better trust means better visibility and a better response.

Virtual Reality is a beautiful jumble of technology and hype. Massive efforts have been expended to develop ways to create and experience VR content.  But the quality of the experience has been underwhelming – limited by hardware performance, massive file sizes, bit rates and download times. There is no practical VR streaming solution that delivers on the promise of VR. The Industry will be stalled until someone can deliver an immersive streaming experience of the highest quality without lag or artifacts, at practical bit rates to the headset – and more importantly, to mobile devices. No one will make money in VR until the experience is greatly improved. This is a big problem.","Media and Entertainment, Video",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
