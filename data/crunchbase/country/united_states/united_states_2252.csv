They are currently under contract to purchase 25 acres of raw land on the south west corner of East Harmony Road and Strauss Cabin Road. This property is located immediately west of I-25, at the gateway to Fort Collins. The property was appraised in June of 2011 for $5,445,000 by Dennis Marion, a well respected MAI appraiser, for the City of Fort Collins who was considering purchasing the 25 acres. There is no doubt that the values have gone up over the last three years, given the strong local economy,  and the increasing demand and decreasing supply of developable property along the East Harmony Corridor. They are attempting to raise $2.5m to finish funding the purchase of the property, free and clear and to fund the entitlement process. The return on investment is conservatively projected to more than double the investors money in less than three years. The timing and location for this project are perfect. Currently, Banner Health is building a hospital next door to the west and Costco is under construction on a new building just east of the subject property. The East Harmony Corridor is the hottest real estate market in Fort Collins and getting hotter. They are proposing to develop a ""Live, Work and Play"" mixed use project. Based upon their market research over the last six years, there is more demand than they will be able to satisfy.
