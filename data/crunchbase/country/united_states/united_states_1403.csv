This ensures that further processing or storage won’t risk leaking the data in its raw form inadvertently. A common use case for JumpWire is moving data between internal databases and tools for analytics and customer support. In this scenario, specific columns (such as those corresponding to PII) may need special handling before loading into another tool with a more permissive access concept.
