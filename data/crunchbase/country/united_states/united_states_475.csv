After all, it has taken you years to gain this knowledge and reputation. An LFE course on your website is the best way to make your knowledge work for you. Literally. Our Philosophy We believe in you. In fact, we are so certain, that we take all the risk involved. Our authors don’t pay any sign-up or setup fees. Actually, there are no upfront or ongoing fees at all: only if someone purchases your courses, then you pay us a small percentage. Promoting your course Sometimes all people need is a little encouragement, a promise of a deal, a promise of a benefit that they will get, if they act now. That’s why we integrated discounting tools into our software. We will never offer a discount on your product, or bundle your courses without your consent!  Control your brand We know how difficult it is to bring traffic to your website. Why send it elsewhere to purchase your digital content? An LFE web store on your website is a great retention tool that keeps your student engaged instead of sending them shopping for knowledge outside your website. Also, you can now sell your courses directly from your Facebook page - where you already have the attention of all your fans. Just another example of how LFE gives authors the tools to make their online brand the best it can be.
