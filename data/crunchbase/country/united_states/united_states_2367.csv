Three devices have already been designed with the participation of leading physicians and surgeons in gastroenterology. Each technology fills a current need in medical procedures by improving upon an existing technology or device or by designing a device to serve a need that is clearly defined and acknowledged by medical professionals. Each product will be priced to appeal to a managed-care market that stresses lowest cost of total treatment parameters. Market segments are clearly defined and are all subject to a high growth trend. Plans for future development include additional technologies that will be developed and patented as appropriate by Erica Ross, VP of R&D for MedBlue. In addition, MedBlue may seek to acquire certain technologies developed by others once it attains sufficient capitalization. MedBlue's objective is to innovate and to market its products. Once an industry reputation has been achieved and marketing channels opened, expansion into other medical device areas becomes potentially rewarding. A recent article in Wired magazine indicates that the biotech field in general is a hotbed of activity with an exciting and lucrative future.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Manufacturing, Science and Engineering",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The company's IMMEX™ software assisted learning in more than 150,000 students in classrooms internationally by integrating these multimedia simulations into a unique web-based learning platform for modeling strategic thinking and problem solving. These models help teachers teach, students learn, and administrators make informed educational decisions through the continual, and real-time evaluation problem solving progress. We accomplish this by leveraging existing proprietary libraries of tasks, data sets and advance intelligence-derived performance models, and then extending them with cutting-edge technologies such as second-by-second Cognitive Electrophysiology models. During the past several years The Learning Chameleon, Inc. has applied these technologies and developed Team NeuroDynamics. While most people can recognize if a team is in the groove or out of synch, it is more difficult to predict when changes in the state will occur, yet having this ability would be important for dynamically adapting team performance. If we can predict when a team is going out of synch, we can provide real-time feedback to help prevent performance errors, lapses in communication or lapses in attention. In this way the company, like its name sake successfully blends within and across educational, training and assessment environments.","Data and Analytics, Design, Software",,,,1,,,,,165000,USD,165000,National Science Foundation,1,1,,Private,,,,,,
