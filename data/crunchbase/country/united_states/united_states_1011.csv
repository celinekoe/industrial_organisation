We don't use outside contractors, so all of our work is done in house so you know you're getting the best service directly from us! Call us today to learn more about how we can help you! Arizona Interlock was founded almost 8 years ago. Our purpose in existing as a company has always been to provide a better experience to those who have been ordered to have the interlock device placed in their vehicle. We have seen our competitor’s dream up hidden fees and surcharges, fail to innovate or improve their product, and overall not providing a level of customer service that you as a paying client would expect from your provider. We have always been at the forefront of innovation in the interlock industry. We are the sole providers of the cup, which disguises your interlock device as a beverage, so as to reduce any uncomfortable moments in public when you need to blow into your device to start your car. We also are the only interlock company that offers a flashcube for your dashboard. This light is a visual cue to the driver that they may need to blow into their device. This is perfect for people who like to play music, drive with the windows open, are hearing impaired, have children or other distractions, now the reminder is not just a beep, but a light blinking on your dashboard, so you do not mess up and get in trouble with the courts for failing to blow. Arizona’s laws concerning DUI and the requirement of an interlock device are some of the toughest in the nation. In addition to jail time and heavy fines, person’s convicted of driving under the influence can expect to be ordered by the courts to have an interlock device placed in their car. These devices measure the alcohol levels in the drivers body by having the driver blow into a tube. Arizona Interlock provides coupons to help get your interlock installed for a fraction of the price. We know that DUI and DWI can involve harsh financial consequences, and being able to save money at any point in the process is very valuable. Currently, Arizona Interlock is providing a coupon that our clients can print and bring in, and we will give them 35% off the first month and Free Ignition Interlock installation. So remember, if you need the cheapest ignition interlock company in AZ that also provides quality devices and great service, then Arizona Interlock is the company for you. We have 6 convenient locations around the Valley, so getting your device installed into your car and then tested and calibrated each month can be as quick and painless as possible. Arizona Interlock has interlock installation throughout the Phoenix Valley. If you have been convicted of DUI in Phoenix, you can look forward to hefty fines, time in jail and having to have an interlock device installed in your car. This process can literally ruin lives – from losing jobs, to breaking marriages, the consequences of putting this much strain on an individual can ripple throughout their life. While we cannot mitigate all the negative consequences of the DUI, we can make having your ignition interlock device installed in our office as easy and quick as possible. Additionally, be sure to print out a coupon for a free install and 35% off your first month! Connect With Us!
