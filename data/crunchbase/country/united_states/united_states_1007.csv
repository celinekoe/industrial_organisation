That’s unheard of to this day, but they weren’t done yet. While many hiring agencies were transitioning to automated call systems, they did the opposite. They actually hired more account managers, because no one likes to talk to a robot. These same agencies began providing platforms where their customers actually have to design and post the job ads themselves… not us! Once again, they went against the grain and decided to handle everything for their clients ourselves. This is when Happy Hiring came to life.

Renting furniture from our vast array of inventory is at the core of our services. Artwork is one the most important aspects of any successful home staging, and for that reason, we have an “in-house” full time picture framing studio to supply an endless source of up-to-date artwork. Furniture and art, combined with selections from our great selection of accessories and any home staging project can be sourced with one stop to our facility. Our firm partners with many professional home stagers throughout the Valley who are interior decorators in their own right. We strongly encourage you to give us a call for a referral if you need home staging services to make your home sell for the top price. Regardless of the housing market conditions, home staging is a small investment compared to the proven decrease in market time and increase in market price which a professional staging will deliver.
