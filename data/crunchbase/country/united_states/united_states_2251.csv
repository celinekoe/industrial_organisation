Our facilitators deliver customized content that will help elevate leaders on the path to success. P2P is currently represented in 35 states.  P2P would like to expand its services by leading national and global efforts dedicated to uplifting marginalized voices and to provide intersectional education that is transformative as well as employment opportunities. P2P trains, educates, and inspires a new generation of leaders, communities, and organizations.

P2P would like to work in partnership with returning citizens and employers to unlock people’s potential.  We are not life time criminals. We are not felons or ex-convicts. We are people. We have always been people. So much of what the criminal justice system and society does is focused on and centered on dehumanizing people like us.  To change the narrative we must use the correct language to change the unfortunate culture of exclusivity in society.  Returning from prison and reentering society is a daunting task with many mountainous barriers. People returning from prison face a number of challenges - many of which we too faced, challenged, and overcame! We can climb that mountain. We can jump that hurdle. And we would like to provide people with that opportunity with funding that can enhance our proven curriculum and training.    Amongst the many challenges of reentry (obtaining housing, finding a job, reconnecting with family), we focus and counsel on them all with a strong emphasis on education. Education broadens horizons, tears down (policy-based and psychological) fences, and leads to career building. It's not good enough to just get a job. We want to help people build a career.

Or, they can go into the app, and see who's online. Worried too many people will call you? Don't worry. When Lighthouse sees you're on a call, it'll automatically put you offline.
