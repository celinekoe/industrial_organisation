Printer and copier environments are two simple systems, often overlooked and unattended, that are converging in the office to produce complex problems and wreak havoc on organizational efficiency. Printing and copying represent a potential source and destination for business-critical information. It is where information gets managed, where documents get produced. While carefully managed, copiers are somewhat unreliable and antiquated for today's digital age. Most fax solutions today are analog, outdated and unreliable. Printers are digital, affordable and reliable, yet have largely been left unmanaged as they spread rapidly across the network. Interestingly, companies will invest vast resources to proactively design how to move information across their network, yet react reluctantly to printing and imaging systems tasked with getting that information on and off the same network. This has created an environment that, for the most part, is fundamentally out of control. And things are only getting worse. Printing systems, copying systems and the information explosion have all collided dramatically to create a ""perfect storm"" of document disorder that has made the sharing of information slow and cumbersome. Businesses need simple and productive ways to manage business information. Users need to be able to work seamlessly with both digital and paper documents. Companies need to control costs and free up resources to focus on their core competencies. Print, Inc. is the premier provider of cost-per-page printing, copying and imaging solutions optimized to help businesses communicate more effectively. Print, Inc. specializes in simplifying the complex, chaotic world of printing and copying with a cost-per-page service that improves workflow and controls costs. Print, Inc. is a new hybrid company that uniquely combines the service benefits of copy with the technology benefits of print to simplify document flow. Years in the making, It is unique in that it is the only company built from the ground up to address the convergence of printing, copying and faxing in the office. In many ways, Print, Inc. is a product of the convergence trend and the problems it has created for customers. Many are calling Print, Inc. a new convergence channel. Print, Inc.'s unique business model has created the perfect marriage of print and copy, digital and paper, control and reliability. Print, Inc. has been successful in today's marketplace by simplifying the complexities of output chaos for customers while improving overall workflow. Print, Inc. sales consultants conduct a detailed assessment of a customer's business environment and then recommend and execute reliable, but flexible solutions that consolidate the print, copy and fax functions on the right devices in the right places for the right people. An effective deployment based on multi-function technology and digital convergence can control costs, improve asset management and speed business communications. And Print, Inc. offers this entire tailored output infrastructure through a simple cost-per-page service that includes all hardware, supplies, service, network connectivity and custom analysis. This service moves printing, copying and faxing to a true usage model that consolidates all of your output costs (acquisition, supplies, maintenance, etc.) to one identified, documented and controlled expense rather than several depreciated capital assets. Print, Inc. delivers strategic transformations that deliver real business results. Customers enjoy real, appreciated value in the way they manage business information with specific benefits of increased productivity, controlled costs and document simplicity.","Content and Publishing, Hardware, Media and Entertainment, Transportation",,,10001+,2,M&A,7400000,USD,7400000,11400000,USD,11400000,"ABS Capital Partners, ORIX Venture Finance, Concert Capital Partners",1,3,,Private,,,,,,

Consumers want to immerse themselves in memorable moments, but often crave alternatives to alcohol. Cannabis products have become more popular and a wide variety of new pioneering cannabis-based options continue to change the landscape of nightlife and social gatherings. LOKI blends these consumer trends and offers a completely new way to enjoy the night. A true innovation in drinking. With only a few sips, you can enhance any moment. As knowledge, research, and complexity around the marijuana industry evolves, new discoveries about the active ingredients and their unique characteristics are constantly being discovered. LOKI's unique ingredient is Delta-8-THC, which is one of the lesser-known natural elements of the cannabis plant. It differs from its more commonly known relative Delta-9-THC by a slight variation in molecular structure. Most cannabis users experience the potent effects of Delta-9, as it makes up the majority of the plant's THC presence. However, by using an extraction method, LOKI can take the more isolated and rarer Delta-8 and offer a cleaner overall experience. Delta-8 offers consumers a far lower psychotropic potency, while still giving them the ability to immerse in prolonged and enjoyable moments.
