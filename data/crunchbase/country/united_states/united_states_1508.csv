The Marine responsible was an experienced, well-trained Sergeant. The next day all of Camp Pendleton was briefed about the incident. This brief, however, did not solve the design flaw that allowed live ammunition to become commingled with blank ammunition. The Army and Marines have lost approximately 10 Soldiers from negligent discharges since 2002, and hundreds more have been injured. This begged the question, “Why is there not a separate magazine for non-lethal ammunition when Soldiers train?” That is where the Safe Tactical Magazine idea was born and is what drives SafeTacMag, LLC today. SafeTacMag’s leadership has had a long friendship, along with a highly functional working relationship, dating back to 2004 when they all met while serving in 2nd Battalion 5th Marines. Deploying on a number of combat missions throughout the years formed close bonds that hold SafeTacMag’s leadership, and the business, together. Through “thick and thin” SafeTacMag’s leadership has overcome many obstacles.
