Texas State Troopers Association,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/texas-state-troopers-association,"Association, Legal, Non Profit, Professional Services, Public Safety","Austin, Texas, United States",The Texas State Troopers Association is a voluntary labor organization which lobbies the state legislature and assists troopers.,"1,531,487",Southern US,$1M to $10M,Active,1984-01-01,year,,,,,Non-profit,https://www.texasstatetroopers.org/,"The Texas State Troopers Association (TSTA)  is a voluntary labor organization of non-supervisory commissioned officers and retirees of the Texas Department of Public Safety. For over 25 years, we have built our association on support, advocacy, and financial assistance for troopers and their families in the state of Texas. With just $25 annual membership dues, members of The Texas State Troopers Association are entitled to legal counsel and representation, advocacy before the Texas Legislature, death/disaster financial relief, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, free preparation of a Last Will and Testament, and personal counsel in times of stress.  Legal Assistance Lawsuits and legal problems can be a huge stress and financial burden for those who have to live through it. Being on the job as a Texas State Trooper and members of law enforcement means dealing with scrutiny at times that could lead to possible litigation problems. A membership with the Texas State Troopers Association means having someone on your side if you’re suddenly faced with legal action and are in need of assistance.   In one instance, a state trooper had arrested a driver who was under the influence of a controlled substance. Unfortunately, the driver was the son of a city council official who filed a lawsuit against the law enforcement official. While the state trooper was just doing his job at upholding the law, he was under duress because he took action against an official’s son. The Texas State Troopers Association was able to provide him with legal assistance so that this lawsuit was settled in court. Free AD&D Insurance The Texas State Troopers Association gives its members free Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance for up to $4,000. This policy gives our members peace of mind for them and their family members should something happen to them. This insurance policy covers accidents that happen while on duty at their position in law enforcement and even on vacation if a freak accident was to occur. Personal Counsel Everyone’s life has stress and problems and a state trooper is certainly no different. It helps to know there is always someone there for you that is just a phone call away. Whether the problem arose because of a problem at work or a situation at home, the Texas State Troopers Association is always there to listen.   When you become a member of the Texas State Troopers Association, you have access to confidential personal counsel to help you get through issues at home or with work. When life gets difficult it’s good to know that you always have someone to talk you through it. Legislative Representation One of the most important jobs of the Texas State Troopers Association is to lobby for the betterment of state troopers. Since law enforcement is employed by the state, their benefits and salary are controlled by the state legislature, which also controls the budget each year for law enforcement.   Programs like retirement and salary for law enforcement are decided upon by the state legislature and the Texas State Troopers Association makes sure they stay informed on the issues that matter to the state troopers of Texas and maintain relationships with the state representative and Senate members.   If you are a retired member of the Texas state troopers or are an active member, the issues that you are involved with will be the issues that matter most to the Texas State Troopers Association. Emergency Assistance In the world we live in, there’s no telling what may happen to our homes and belongings. Natural disasters like floods, tornados, and hurricanes can threaten our homes and put a terrible financial burden on any of us. Homeowners insurance is essential, but it often does not cover all of the expenses that come along with having damage done to our homes. Hotel bills and insurance deductibles add up quickly and even the most financially careful individuals can lose money and be put into debt by the overwhelming cost.   Fortunately, the Texas State Troopers Association offers emergency assistance to our members who suffer in a disaster situation. Our assistance check can go toward paying down a deductible or other needed expenses that arise due to a natural disaster.   Many of us have families that we are responsible for providing for and should something happen to us, would put our loved ones in jeopardy. Unfortunately, many Americans live paycheck to paycheck and a couple missed paychecks would put them in dire circumstances. Our members can rest a little easier knowing that their membership with the Texas State Troopers Association could help cover the costs for their families should something happen to them. Online Monthly Newsletter Stay informed on all of the news surrounding the Texas State Troopers Association through our online monthly newsletter. Here you will find information on events we’re hosting, legislative news, unique stories about our state troopers, health tips, and much more. When you sign up with TSTA, you have the option of filling out an online profile so that the newsletter will be sent directly to your inbox on the first week of the month. Our newsletter is also available by going to our website to access it. Free Will Service Members of the Texas State Troopers Association are entitled to a very important service: last will and testament drafting. If a member, you have no excuse to not use this service because it is 100% free with your TSTA membership! A will could be the difference between your family’s peace of mind and utter chaos if you were to pass away. TSTA provides all of their members with free will and testament drafting, provided by former TSTA president, Lee Johnson. All that is required is for you to send in your information and Johnson takes care of the legal side of it. The basic information he will need is as follows: The names, addresses, and telephone numbers of all parties involved. This will include your spouse and all of your children. Johnson reminds us that almost all of us leave everything to our spouse, with spouse as the executor. In the event that both spouses should pass away together, one of the children or a trusted adult can be names as alternate executor. Make your choice for someone in your family, perhaps your spouse or an adult son or daughter, to have general Power of Attorney over the one that is deceased or incapacitated. This becomes void upon death– and should only be given to a very trusted person and trusted alternate. Decide on someone to be given Medical Power of Attorney over the one who may be incapacitated as to health. This person will be authorized to make medical decisions. Medical power of attorney is activated when declarant is unable to communicate decisions to a health care provider. Select someone to be named Guardian of the family member who may pass away. This person will probably be appointed by the court to make decisions concerning the assets of the deceased. The guardian takes over if a declarant is unable to make decisions and becomes void upon death. TSTA attorney Lee Johnson will provide you with a “designation to physicians” form to instruct medical people to not use artificial means to prolong life. It is called a “Living Will.” One you have sent in the above information, Johnson will put the will together, mail it back to your for approval, and then you are free to notarize it before a witness and rest easy with the knowledge that your affairs will be taken care of regardless of what may or may not happen to you in the future. We lobby for causes on behalf of troopers by helping positive bills pass, defending against bills that could hurt our members, and tracking neutral bills to ensure that we are the first to notice any changes. We work alongside numerous other associations, stakeholder groups, and legislators.","Government and Military, Other, Professional Services, Social Impact",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Kennedy, Jr. and Donald M. Kennedy, partners with an exceptional record of creating value through their leadership. Their first company was Instacom, founded in 1970, taken public by Smith, Barney and Rotan- Mosle in 1981, then sold to ComData(NYSE) in 1984. The sale was structured as a tax-free exchange with a total value of $130,000,000. Bill Kennedy, Jr. then served as Chairman of ComData until 1985, when he resigned to form HighwayMaster, Inc. HighwayMaster was successful as well, and was taken public in 1995 in a joint underwriting by Merrill Lynch, CS First Boston, and Smith, Barney. In the offering, 18% of the company was sold for $79,000,000, resulting in a total market value of $435,000,000. In 2000 it was sold to Minor Planet, Inc., an English company. Both previous highly successful operations were in transportation, communications and location technologies, however neither enjoyed market size that is currently available to On-Board Communications, Inc. When the non-compete provisions expired, the previous successful engineering team joined Bill and Don at On-Board to insure further technical and business success. The engineering team has collectively secured over 40 patents over the years, pioneering many developments in enhanced cellular networks and GPS for emergency service, route guidance, and theft detection/tracking.","Hardware, Information Technology, Sales and Marketing, Software",1,William C.

Freewayaudio is the name of a multi-functional online business aimed toward allowing musical artist of all genres more exposure to both listeners and record labels. Music artist would be able to create a social profile like any other major social media website, however this online opportunity would allow fans and followers to critic and vote only on the artist they are fans of and following. Each artist in each genre will compete for artist of the month for six months. The top six will then compete for the remainder six months for artist of the year. The winner will in turn receive a prize, which I would love to be a record deal, and a feature in several magazines telling their story. I believe this opportunity will benefit those who have amazing talent, yet are not able to take advantage of opportunities to show their talent like American Idol, The Voice, Xfactor, etc. Many individuals are not able to take advantage of these opportunities do to unfortunate circumstances. Which is where freewayaudio comes in to offer another avenue of opportunity to get their talent exposed to millions with the same initial idea as American Ideal, but online. The site will require a membership fee be paid for the artist to create profiles and upload their music. The development cost for the venture would be $10,000.
