This patented process improves cycle time, minimizes material handling, lowers operating costs and improves yield and quality from other systems. As the greenest of all extraction methods, SCO2 plans to recover oils from the waste accumulating for growers and processors.  Our business model is simple: 'turn trash into cash'. We hate to see anything go to waste (and harm the environment). Our plan is simple - supply the same high-value essential oils being purchased by medium and large oil customers in the Food, Pharma, Cosmetics and Personal Care segments that are sustainably sourced and offered at a %-10% discount. Our customer is already motivated to meet key sustainability objectives. The financial incentive is designed to accelerate adoption. With zero cost raw material, low operating costs and high yields, SCO2 is a least cost producer who can afford to make a meaningful impact. In the U.S., 56 billion pounds of food is wasted at growers and processors each year. But, we can make a difference. SCO2 has the right people, plan and patents to uniquely tackle this problem.
