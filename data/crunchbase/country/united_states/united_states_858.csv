SteadyServ's iKeg technology is an IoT driven SaaS solution which measures and reports, on a near-real-time basis, down to the ounce, the exact volume of beer remaining in a retailer's kegs.   Up until today, it has been nearly impossible to track and manage draft beer inventory effectively.  Given that draft sales exceed $23 billion dollars each year in just the U.S., the cost of waste lost sales and unimproved yields and the margin is staggering.   The system uses collected intelligence to make a purchase and product mix decisions based on the distributor’s current inventory, past on-premise performance, profitability goals, comparative popularity, and availability at nearby competitors.  The average retailer sees a 400% cash on cash return on investment.   SteadyServ has also developed a dynamic digital menu that showcases, and auto-curates every draft beer currently on tap, as well as, automatically updates and corrects beers when they change status (volume, price, availability).  This information can be manipulated based on consumption patterns and is augmented with contextual advertising, which has a positive impact on sales.  SteadyServ can provide retailers and brewers with onsite performance analytics to provide insights on marketing and promotion attribution. SteadyServ also owns the world's largest database of beer, which it uses as part of the iKeg and Kegonomics solutions.  Moreover, SteadyServ ingests every retail transaction across every SKU its retail base sells, which provides SteadyServ a massive, rich, and real-time database of draft beer and on-premise retail activity that before has been unavailable.

All Aurimune products seek out and destroy the blood vessels inside any primary or metastatic solid tumor. Tumor blood vessel destruction alters the tumor microenvironment in a way that significantly improves the effectiveness of other therapies including chemotherapies, radiation therapies and immunotherapies.  CYT-6091, the first generation Aurimune nanomedicine and a first-in-class therapeutic, was shown to be safe and tumor-targeted in a Phase I Clinical Trial. CytImmune is raising funds to advance CYT-6091 through Clinical Trials.  All Aurimune™ products are built around a 27nm gold nanoparticle core. Gold is known to be safe, has a flexible chemistry including forming covalent bonds, and can be manufactured with scale and precision in GMP conditions. All Aurimune products carry Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF). Additionally, CytImmune developed a patented gold pegylation technology to prevent Aurimune removal by the immune system. This stealth attribute allows Aurimune to remain in circulation long enough to concentrate inside solid tumors.  The Aurimune family of nanomedicines includes CYT-6091 and several second generation, multifunctional nanomedicines. Second generation nanomedicines use TNF to destroy tumor blood vessels, then deliver anti-cancer agents including chemotherapies and targeted biologics into the tumor. Preclinical data indicate this approach concentrates anti-cancer therapies inside solid tumors, which dramatically increases effectiveness while reducing drug-related side effects.

Knowing the current state of traffic lights and how they will change creates opportunities to increase driving safety, increase fuel efficiency, and improve the driving experience. Applications range from EnLighten, which tells drivers when the light they are stopped at will turn green, to vehicle powertrain optimization based on the state of upcoming lights. Safety is their number one priority. They alert drivers to possible dangers without distracting them. For example, EnLighten tells drivers stopped at red lights whether they have time to catch their breath for a few seconds, change the radio station, or pick up the papers that fell on the floor. EnLighten waits until the car stops, so the driver is not distracted, then announces how long the light will be red and gives a visual countdown. A few seconds before the light turns green, an alert sounds to tell the driver to focus on to the road. Another service They are developing warns drivers when they, or another connected vehicle, are about to run a red light. They partner with municipalities, handling the complexities of gathering real-time signal data and making it available in consistent formats for a variety of uses. Unlike other connected-vehicle technologies, their approach requires neither costly municipal infrastructure investments nor the addition of dedicated hardware to every vehicle. They communicate securely with existing traffic-signal infrastructure, and handle translation of different manufacturers' signal data to a common format.","Apps, Mobile, Navigation and Mapping, Platforms, Software, Transportation",2,"Matt Ginsberg, Ravindra Kondagunta",1-10,10,Private Equity,2492199,USD,2492199,2792199,USD,2792199,"Benhamou Global Ventures, Plug and Play, Toyota Ventures, Sand Hill Angels, Tech Coast Angels",2,5,,Private,,,,,,

Their vision of applying LiDAR technology everywhere encapsulates their belief that LiDAR has many valuable uses that will benefit humanity in ways that have not yet been realized. Almost 40 years ago founding member James Portman saw for the first time how sensors based on optical time-of-flight principles could detect and measure objects and surfaces in great detail, even from far away. This powerful extra-sensory capability has evolved to the point where small, autonomous machines can avoid obstacles and understand their surroundings. The same sense allows LiDAR networks to monitor and analyze stockpiles of bulk, solid materials. These are just a few of many possible applications. You may be wondering if it’s possible to design and manufacture high-quality LiDARs at a price that allows for wide adoption. The answer is a resounding yes and this is what LightWare does every day. They recognize that each application has specific requirements so they tailor the design of their products to meet these requirements. The result is economical sensors that perfectly fit your needs. The management team at Lightware is focused on building a world-class organization, from their high-quality manufacturing system that produces thousands of LiDARs each month to their experienced product development team. Their support desk guides customers as they discover powerful LiDAR solutions for their unique use cases. At LightWare they are dedicated to the mission of applying their exceptional technology to solving important problems: making drone deliveries safer, monitoring ore movement on mines, counting animals in Kenya, delivering vaccines in Malawi.

Anchored Assembly accurately detects SNPs, indels, and structural variants ranging from 10bp to 100kbp.  Anchored Assembly uses data from HiSeq and MiSeq without special library prep. You can detect structural variants using your existing data.  We optimize Anchored Assembly to ensure a very low false positive rate and reliably detect your variants at the rate that you produce data. How does Anchored Assembly work?  Spiral’s Anchored Assembly uses direct, de novo read overlap assembly to accurately detect SNPs, indels, and structural variants. Application of read overlap assembly to high-coverage whole genome data is a challenge because of its computational demands. Anchored Assembly reduces this computational complexity by focusing analysis on non-reference sequence regions. We map variant sequences to specific genome locations by “anchoring”, or matching the ends of the assembled variant, to unique sequences present in the reference genome. Assembly begins from these reference-anchored reads and traverses variant regions by constructing a read overlap graph. Anchored Asssembly is available via Cloud or Cluster. Features include: Read Alignment (BWA, Bowtie and T-Map), SNPs and Indels (SOAP and Maq), Assembly Based Variant Detection, Effect Prediction, Associated Gene and Pathways, Associated Phenotypes and Disease, KEGG, OMIM, LOVD and PharmGKB Links, Ensembl Browser Display, Upload/Download Common Data Formats, Cloud and Cluster Versions, Ion Torrent Plugin to stream data directly to Spiral Cloud","Biotechnology, Data and Analytics, Internet Services, Science and Engineering, Software",2,"Adina Mangubat, Jeremy Bruestle",11-50,7,M&A,4065591,USD,4065591,4415591,USD,4415591,"Y Combinator, Tech Coast Angels, Bossanova Investimentos, CP Ventures, 415",1,7,,Private,,,,,,
