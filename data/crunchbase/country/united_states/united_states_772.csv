Indeed there was; not only dramatically less expensive, but also with significant performance advantages. Today Auralex takes great pride in offering a full line of acoustical products based on the “better price/better mousetrap” principle. The great initial success of Studiofoam® quickly led to other innovations including our industry-leading Venus™ and LENRD™ Bass Traps. When no reasonably priced diffusors existed, we developed the high-performance T’Fusor™ and MiniFusor™. When our customers demanded a modular, absorptive, expandable, and, most importantly, portable solution, we introduced the MAX-Wall™ (the first acoustical product to ever be featured on the cover of a major industry magazine) and Stand-Mounted LENRDs™ to great widespread acclaim! When there were few low-cost, effective construction and isolation products, we answered with SheetBlok™, U-Boat™ Floor Floaters, PlatFoam™, and other affordable solutions. Most recently, our staff has created specialty products such as the GRAMMA™ (Gig & Recording Amp & Monitor Modulation Attenuator) and our hot new MoPADs™ that answer critical isolation needs and result in dramatically truer sound.","Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio, Other",1,Eric Smith,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

But to the people at the S.S.S. Company, it’s one of the most significant dates in history. For it was in 1826 that the mighty Creek Indians bequeathed a treasured remedy of theirs, now known as S.S.S. Tonic, to Captain Irwin Dennard of Perry, Georgia as a reward for having saved the life of one of their Chieftains. Captain Dennard sold the formula to Colonel Charles T. Swift who also lived in Perry, Georgia. Colonel Swift formed a partnership with Colonel H.J. Lamar of Macon, Georgia to bottle and sell the Tonic. In 1873, Colonel H.J. Lamar, foreseeing Atlanta as the Metropolis of the south, the manufacturer of S.S.S. Tonic was moved to Atlanta. According to the Companys’ History, the S.S.S. stood for Swift’s Southern Specific in the earlier years. From this storybook-like beginning, The S.S.S. Company was born. Now it’s the oldest non-prescription drug manufacturer in the country. After operating for more than one hundred plus years with only one product, S.S.S. Tonic, the company became diversified. Today, S.S.S.   Company and its’ wholly owned subsidiary, Pfeiffer Pharmaceuticals, Inc., markets over one hundred products.

The Foundation began by running the USA Mathematical Talent Search, a nationwide math contest sponsored by the National Security Agency which continues to run to this day. In each round, this contest gives students a full month to work on five challenging proof-based problems. Students then get individual feedback on their work, including comments on their mathematical reasoning and on their proof-writing skills. By taking away the usual time pressures seen in many math contests, students have the opportunity to go more deeply and to explore. For many years, the Foundation also ran the Local Programs Initiative which provided fiscal sponsorship to math circles and clubs across the country. Now, the main project of the Foundation is the Summer Program in Mathematical Problem Solving, a project to help underserved students find a realistic pathway towards becoming scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and programmers. During the summer after 7th grade, students are invited to participate in a free three-week residential program on a college campus where they gain the academic and social/emotional preparation to succeed in future programs for advanced study. They then receive academic advising throughout 8th grade and high school to help them and their families find the best opportunities for their educations. The Art of Problem Solving Foundation receives support from Art of Problem Solving (AoPS), which develops resources for high-performing middle and high school students including the largest online community of avid math students in the English-speaking world. The AoPS online school has trained many winners of major national mathematics competitions, including several gold medalists at the International Math Olympiad, Davidson Fellows, and winners of the Intel and Siemens Talent Search competitions. The Art of Problem Solving Foundation is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization. It continues to be led by expert mathematicians and educators to this day.

For decades his company, Red Adair Wild Well Control, has regularly been called to deal with major oil fires. Adair grew up poor. He worked in a drugstore and for the railroad. For twenty years, beginning in 1939, he worked for Myron Kinley where he learned how to put out oil well fires. Near the end of the Second World War, he searched for unexploded shells in Japan and disarmed them. In 1962, Adair's reputation as a fearless firefighter spread when he put out a fire in Algeria nicknamed the Devil's Cigarette Lighter. It had been burning for six months, fueled by 550 million cubic feet of gas a day. In 1984, Adair's specialists put out a major offshore rig fire near Rio de Janeiro. His firefighters were the first to board the Occidental Petroleum Company's Piper Alpha oil rig in the North Sea after it was destroyed by an explosion in 1988. They were among the first to put out the devastating oil fires in Kuwait, started by Saddam Hussein's Iraqi military forces at the end of Operation Desert Storm in 1991. Red Adair and his company inspired the 1968 action-adventure film about their exploits titled Hellfighters, which starred John Wayne as Adair.","Health Care, Sports",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

In the US the total energy consumption of open refrigeration represents 55% of a typical convenience store and 35% of grocery stores. This represents the largest known source of wasted energy in the commercial sector. The problem is so substantial that new 2014 legislation (proposed) is being introduced by the US Department of Energy in an attempt to curb inefficiencies. The Company estimates that the global market opportunity for this energy saving solution in the grocery and the convenience store market is $20 billion. Globally where electricity prices are higher, the need and opportunities are even greater for energy efficiency solutions. Alternative market solutions have inadequately addressed this challenge to date, creating an attractive opportunity for a solution that is more closely aligned with their needs. The company intends to challenge the status quo by introducing a solution that can substantially reduce the energy wasted, while maintaining a low ROI that is more in line with customer expectations. The Company has secured Angel funding, formed a Team that addresses the key aspects of its business plan, secured a global manufacturing partnership and signed a Research Agreement with a top ten public research University. The Team leading the research is headed by a Professor who is a globally recognized leader in the field of technology being used to develop the Company's solutions.","Energy, Manufacturing",2,"Kalu Watanabe, Subrata Roy",1-10,3,Seed,200000,USD,200000,335000,USD,335000,,,,,Private,,,,,,
