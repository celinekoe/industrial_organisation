No more junk cluttering up wallets and purses, digital loyalty cards, new deals, and your old barcode cards all in one place. Detailed vendor listings integrate with Yelp, Google maps/directions. The app enables users to share kicks and kickbacks (earnings and rewards) with friends on Facebook. In-app ads are actually relevant, deals from local vendors. The Process: Customers scan QR codes from the vendor by using a ""kicker"" once they have purchased an item to earn their kick (earning).  Another way to earn a kick is through our ""paper kicks"".  These paper kicks are handed out to customers if they do not have the app installed, the vendor is busy, or other reasons that as a quick handout is necessary so that the user can scan the QR code at their convenience.  The QR codes on the paper kicks are unique and can only be scanned once.   When a user has enough kicks, they can redeem their kickback (rewards) with the participating vendor.

Providing you with more customers is our passion. Why Choose Pradica For Your Marketing? ...because it works.   The Pradica methodology covers all the steps taken to find a targeted customer, convert them into a sale, and then recycle them in the process to promote more services. We have found that many customers think they need just one or two things to solve their problems, but in reality, they need a strategic plan that is tailored to their business.   Our first step is to do a full assessment of your business to find any loopholes or bottlenecks in your sales and marketing funnels. Once we have implemented correct procedures to handle new business and have corrected any technicalities in the business process, we start our integrated marketing plan.   In today’s digital word, the consumer is more knowledgeable than ever, so it is important that you create some type of relationship with them in the life-cylce of their buying process. Our techniques are used to attract your targeted customer at different stages by offering them content that is delivered precisely at the right time.   The inbound marketing or “around the clock” marketing technique is the most successful method of marketing we have found in the past 10 years. This is because there are three simple steps in this process that make it extremely effective. The idea of the inbound methodology is to magnetize your potential customer with great content, convert your potential customer through great calls to action and landing pages, and finally close your potential customer through engaging direct response and automated marketing campaigns. We call it “life cycle marketing” “around the clock marketing” or as many know it, inbound marketing.","Advertising, Professional Services, Sales and Marketing",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Gift Card Combo aims to close that gap by providing services that allow consumers to store all of their gift card information in one place and to track the value of their cards.  Gift Card Combo will develop a mobile application to link those gift cards to a financial account and a payment card, such as a debit card or a credit card.  When a consumer uses his payment card, Gift Card Combo determines if the consumer has a gift card with that merchant.  If a valid gift card is on file, Gift Card Combo applies the value of the gift card before applying the funds in the account.   Gift Card Combo will be very attractive for our partners, such as banks and telephone companies because Gift Card Combo will charge a fee for this service and split it with our partners.  Also, since a payment card is required, it encourages young people to obtain bank accounts, which provides more incentive for banks to partner with Gift Card Combo. Gift Card Combo has filed U.S Patent Application No. 13/656,848 on the method and system for performing these services. Gift Card Combo also intends to sell and resell gift cards to the public.  Gift Card Combo will facilitate the exchange of privately owned gift cards between people who want to sell and purchase existing gift cards and will take a commission for doing so. Finally, Gift Card Combo will provide a digital wallet service to its customers.  Digital wallets digitize all of the cards and items in the customer’s wallet and is more secure because it requires a password for access.  Digital wallet applications and services are gaining a foothold in the market and are experiencing massive growth due to the large number of mobile devices. Digital wallets will be provided to individuals, families, and corporations at different rates.",Financial Services,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
