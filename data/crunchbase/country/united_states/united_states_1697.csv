They even have a pending sale to a major US sporting goods store for 10,000 units and much more.

Get the same MLS listing, in the same Agent's MLS with all the other MLS listed homes, but without the 6% commission. More and more For Sale By Owners are learning about this method of getting listed in MLS and are saving thousands in commissions. The internet is changing how homes are marketed and sold, and For Sale By Owner home sellers are gaining the upper hand. Regardless what you would pay a 6% real estate agent, your listing will still be in the same MLS. Anything else a 6% agent would do for you, we can do, or you can do yourself. For example, it doesn't take a genius to hold an Open House, make a flyer, or talk to buyers. In fact, most For Sale By Owner sellers do a better job at most of these things than Agents anyway. When you list your For Sale By Owner home in MLS through us, you are guaranteed to get additional exposure on national websites as well. These include Realtor.com®, yahoo.com, excite.com, remax.com, kw.com, msn.com, prudential.com, homegain.com, realestate.com, homeseekers.com. Many 6% Agents intentionally exclude listings from these national websites because it might hurt their chances of making a full commission. For Sale By Owner MLS Savings Here's the simple math of when you list your For Sale By Owner home through us versus a 6% agent. Let's assume your home sells for $500,000. Here are the 3 possibilities: If you list with a 6% agent, you pay a $30,000 commission, even if the agent didn't do anything and you sold the house yourself. If you list with us, and an agent brings sells your home, you pay our listing fee plus the commission to that agent only. Assuming our listing fee of $349, and that you decided on 3% to the buyer's agent, you pay $349 plus $15,000. Your total savings is $14,651. If you list with us and the buyer doesn't have an agent, you only pay our listing fee, and zero commission. Total savings is $29,651! For Sale By Owner MLS Listing services – Why we are the best! This website is owned by a large real estate company that has been helping For Sale By Owner sellers save real estate commissions for over 8 years. You don't have to worry about us going out of business during your listing term. We answer our phone! That may not sound like much, but many online companies can only be reached by email or voicemail. Some can't be reached at all! No company has a higher client satisfaction rate, and we are a member of the Better Business Bureau. There are no hidden fees. Included and optional services are stated on our website. We have the best agents and brokers across the country. Most of our brokers have been doing our listings for many years and are well established. Our brokers will refer buyer calls directly to you. Other companies will try to make the buyer agent commission every time a buyer calls them about your property. Calls are referred to you so you can AVOID the commission, which is the whole point of this program. You get a FREE listing on this website. Click Here for Details Steps to List Your For Sale By Owner home in MLS Select your State on our Map Review services offered and click on ""Place Order"" Enter order information and property address A receipt for your online payment will be emailed to you Later that day or the next business morning you will receive an email with instructions and information we need from you to enter your listing in MLS. Call us if you do not get this email within 24 hours after you place your order. From this point forward, the broker assigned to your listing will be your primary point of contact. Once you submit the required information, your property will get listed in MLS, usually no later than the next business day. It will take one to five days for your listing to appear in Realtor.com® and other websites after it is entered in MLS. How soon depends on how often and when the MLS feeds their data to the various websites.","Real Estate, Sports",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

These SSP's specialize in moving unusual, delicate or large items such as vehicles, boats, motorcycles, livestock, equipment, contents of homes and apartments, and more. Shipping Service Providers place competing bids on the auctions they choose to enter to win customer's business. The Shipper selects the competing bid that best serves their needs. Other websites charge a large commission to their SSP's. We offer low cost / flat rate subscription plans that meet the needs of any size Shipping Service Provider. This allows SSP's to pass additional savings onto the Shipper and win more business due to our no commission auction platform. Shipping Service Providers (SSP's) always Win! As a participating SSP on the ShipAlmostAnything.com website, the SSP's will have access to an unlimited number of auctions posted every day. The SSP pays a very affordable flat monthly subscription rate that allows unlimited bidding on all site auctions. This is so much more cost controlling and less expensive than the average commission paid on competing websites. Combine the flat fee with our open communication policy and the competing SSP's can make quick and informed decisions. We anticipate hundreds of shipping auctions posted daily. Small independent SSP's and larger SSP's have an equal opportunity to bid on jobs that suit their needs and scheduled routes. A subscribing member on the SAA website can fill their trucks, find profitable backhauls and avoid ""deadheading"". The profitability of their business will immediately increase while reducing wasted time on the road. SAA provides the SSP's a number of useful tools to help them start a new or build their current online business. Shippers always Win! Shippers can post as many shipments as desired. All listings are free and our website makes finding someone to move all items simple and affordable. Shipping Service Providers place competitive bids to win the auction for your shipment. This helps drive down the cost of shipping dramatically versus conventional methods of obtaining shipping/moving price quotes. The SAA website provides Shippers all the tools necessary to make informed decisions when selecting a SSP. Unlike other websites, we do not charge a commission. Our platform, which allows for open communication between the SSP and the Shipper, aids all participants in the auction process to make the best decisions possible, making our website truly easy to ship your complicated stuff.","Commerce and Shopping, Transportation",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

It is our objective to provide regional waste companies and communities a viable ""partner"" to implement residential curbside recycling programs and community sponsored recycling programs. We differ from our competitors in that we truly look at our customers as partners and have developed a profit sharing arrangement that allows the customer to realize a profit from the collected material without having to build processing facilities. This business is scalable and we are currently looking as sites in KY and OK for our next Projects. Once operational we will also add similar products for Commercial/Industrial customers where we will work with customers to develop solutions to their current waste management programs which will focus on diverting material from landfills thereby avoiding costs for transportation and landfilling tip fees. The product offering will allow the customer to reduce costs and find value in material previously viewed as waste. We are currently seeking lease/debt financing for the Project in Licking County Ohio. We have a Venture Capital partner that has committed $600K in equity to the Project Company. In addition to the equity commitment of $600,000 we have a commitment from Westfund, LLC to provide a $300K AR line of credit once we are operational.
