IMMAD technology is a tool for law enforcement use roadside.,"1,260,780","Greater Boston Area, East Coast, New England",,Active,2016-01-03,day,,,,,For Profit,,Impairment Measurement Marijuana and Driving (IMMAD) is a test of visual impairment using a tablet or cell phone screen to quickly test the central forty degrees of visual field.   There already are standards in many driving related regulations for size and function of visual field and peripheral vision.  IMMAD tests central vision.  IMMAD uses striped square or circle targets that are five degrees.  The stripes may appear anywhere within the central forty degrees of vision and are of varying contrast.  With marijuana use a person cannot see the stripes that are of lower contrast. The signal used in IMMAD has been demonstrated to be extremely sensitive in the detection of marijuana related driving impairment in preliminary testing.  IMMAD will be a simple two- minute objective test in a tablet or cell phone.  IMMAD uses proprietary technology to measure the sensory functional visual deficits caused by marijuana use.  It capitalizes on the retinal dopamine depletion and acetylcholine neurotransmitter inhibition that occurs with marijuana use.  Acute and chronic use of marijuana impairs retinal ganglion cell functioning.  Functional impairments measured with IMMAD correlate with blood biomarker measures of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). ,"Biotechnology, Community and Lifestyle, Food and Beverage, Government and Military, Health Care, Privacy and Security, Science and Engineering",1,Dr. Denise A Valenti,1-10,1,,,,,,USD,,AcceliCITY powered by Leading Cities,,1,,Private,,,,,,
