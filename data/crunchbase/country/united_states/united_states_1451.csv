Our attorneys specialize in many facets of the legal word – from medical malpractice to DUI cases and criminal defense, and have over 22 years of combined litigation experience. And we put 100% of our experience, expertise, effort, legal knowledge, and our commitment to getting justice for our clients. But our pledge to personal service and representation doesn't just come to an end with a signed check. Many big law firms like to advertise big cases and verdicts because these cases mean they’ve been paid a large sum of money. But how does a dubious plan like this help you? A huge settlement may look great on paper, but after everyone has taken his or her cut then you’re probably not left with anywhere near as much as what you wanted or felt you deserved. The good thing about our firm is that we don’t work just for the money – we work for you! What matters most to us is not the settlement number – but instead it’s about maximizing the amount you can take home and keep for yourself and family. Even after you receive your settlement or judgment, we continue to work for you by helping you get the maximum value out of your lawsuit. We’re able to negotiate with doctors, insurance companies, even Medicare and/or Medicaid to help you save a larger amount of your settlement or judgment. Then we help advice you on how to protect that money so it will be long-term and when you need it most. Our Expansive Services Include: •     Medical malpractice •     Product liability •     Wrongful death •     Criminal defense •     Credit fraud •     Car accident injury cases",Professional Services,1,David B.
