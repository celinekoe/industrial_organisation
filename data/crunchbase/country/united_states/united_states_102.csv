President and founder Brad Chism is a Business Computer Information Systems graduate of the University of North Texas in Denton Texas. The company was built on the premise that security is the number one priority when dealing with computer electronics. In 2006 Computer Crusher developed equipment that allowed them to physically destroy computer hard drives onsite for their customers.  This new method allowed them to show their customers first hand that their data was actually being destroyed. Customers raved that their data was confidently handled before they even left their facility. NBC channel 5 news in Dallas/ Fort Worth filmed a segment for their “Going Green” series on their approach to computer recycling in the summer of 2007. Since then, various news media outlets including the Dallas Morning News have done follow up stories on their progress. Chism founded the company believing that customers should not just be promised that their sensitive data will be destroyed offsite at another facility, but wanted them to see with their own eyes that it was being done properly. Computer Crusher uses no power or electricity to accomplish the data destruction. This means your data is not only securely destroyed on-site, but no energy is wasted as well. Forgoing the use of energy hungry wiping or degaussing techniques allows them to provide the most green method of data destruction possible. Chism, who at the age of 10 started a business recycling old newspapers from local neighborhoods, strives continuously to ensure that e-waste managed by Computer Crusher Recycling Company is handled in the most environmentally responsible manner. This environmental stewardship has allowed Computer Crusher to tout a proud zero landfill policy. Computer Crusher also partners with local entities to properly monitor downstream recycling. This allows them to ensure their downstream maintains the same strict standards as themselves. Through a new comprehensive inventory system their employees are now able to track, sort, and store materials processed by their facility. This attention to detail in item tracking allows you to know the exact materials that have left your facility. It is their goal to provide a secure and responsible outlet for the recycling of computer electronics for both businesses and residents.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Sustainability",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
