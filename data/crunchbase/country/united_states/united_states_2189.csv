As a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, he took on stints at Bistro Bis and Craigie on Main in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His passion for barbecue was reignited when he became the first pit master for the famed Hill Country Barbecue in Penn Quarter in DC where he resided for 2 years. While working at Hill Country, he formed great relationships with the staff and helped bring it to high standards. In early 2012, he hung up his black pit master shirt and decided to open his own barbecue restaurant. In November 2013, Rob Sonderman established DCity Smokehouse. In a span of month’s, DCity Smokehouse added more staff, who worked with Rob previously, and grew a reputation within the NoMa, Eckington, Bloomingdale, and Shaw neighborhoods of DC. In May 2014,Washington City Paper named the Meaty Palmer the Best Sandwich in DC 2014. In August, the Washington Post named DCity Smokehouse as the best barbecue restaurant in DC and Thrillist.com put us on their list of the top 15 best new barbecue restaurant in the entire country. Most recently, the Washington Post added us on their 2014 Fall Dining Guide and Thrillist, again, added us on their list of best Southern food in DC.

Musical notes can elicit diverse emotions and each emotion can be mapped to a color. So when someone is looking for soothing music, they may be more likely to pick softer colors and in the same way, softer-colored music. In the same vein, Guitarati users can follow their instinct by picking colors and quickly find music they actually like. While they listen to a song, they can also mark it with various colors they are intuitively attracted to. Each song thus has a dominant color, resulting from collective color markings. The music is offered in DRM free mp3 format. Users can listen to 192 kbps or better full-length songs or free samples. They pay 1 cent for each full-length song streaming, and these cents get deducted from the download price when they download the song. Guitarati provides multiple revenue streams for bands and labels, as they get paid for song downloads as well as streaming. They decide the price of their music and retain 75% of the earnings. Record labels can manage their entire roster and earnings through a single dashboard.
