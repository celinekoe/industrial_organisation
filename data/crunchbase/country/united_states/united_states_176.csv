The added support comes from Crosslayer Networks, a privately held, venture-backed developer of highly integrated scalable silicon solutions that bring advanced QoS (quality-of-service) capabilities to next-generation switches and routers. Founded in August 2000 and headquartered in Fremont, Calif., the company is focused on becoming the leader in providing powerful, flexible semiconductors for tomorrow's network infrastructure. Crosslayer serves system vendors that make switches for the Ethernet market. A major part of what distinguishes the company from others of its kind is its revolutionary combined packet-processor and switch fabric architecture. The unique Crosslayer architecture accommodates emerging technologies, such as 10-gigabit Ethernet and MPLS (multi-protocol label switching), and allows the system vendors to create products that deliver rich features and high scalability at an attractive price/performance ratio. The switches and routers that result from Crosslayer's architecture directly address the next-generation networking needs of metro service providers and enterprises, letting the system vendors parlay Crosslayer's expertise into their own commercial success. Ethernet is already the dominant LAN technology in the enterprise market, and with the rapid deployment of gigabit Ethernet and introduction of 10-gigabit Ethernet, this technology is rapidly expanding its application space into the MAN. By focusing on those markets, Crosslayer differs substantially from run-of-the-mill startups that have yet to see their chosen business targets reach critical mass. Crosslayer gains yet another differentiating advantage from the quality of its people. The expertise of its employees includes networking software development, networking architecture and systems development, ASIC logic and physical design, and board-level hardware design. The company's founders have worked together for more than 12 years at several leading networking equipment vendors, and have built an excellent track record that includes creating and licensing the Cyclone switch architecture to Netvantage Corp. and later managing Cabletron Systems' Netvantage division","Information Technology, Internet Services, Other, Privacy and Security",,,11-50,1,Early Stage Venture,6000000,USD,6000000,6000000,USD,6000000,"Galaxy Venture Capital, Amidzad Partners, Crescent Capital",,3,,Private,,,,,,

Dan Forootan founded EZ Publishing in 1998 as a Web hosting and design company. As word spread about the company’s combination of exceptional infrastructure and comprehensive customer-support, the company thrived. Dan soon realized that providing Websites to his customers was a good first step, but that clients wanted more. Through talking with customers, the EZ Publishing team determined that they could leverage Internet technology to help customers solve business problems and increase revenue. Starting in 2000, EZ Publishing started to turn these conversations into reality by expanding services to meet the increasing Internet technology needs of businesses. Website designers and hosting resellers asked for an easy way to provide Web hosting and increase revenues earned from hosting. EZ Publishing responded with the Backend Server solution, which is a fully automated platform that enables clients to create their own hosting packages and prices. This solution automates everything from account creation to billing — while EZ Publishing provides the technical support. This service has been very popular with Web design professionals and hosting resellers. Many EZ Publishing customers asked for an email marketing solution to help build sales and strengthen customer retention. In response, EZ Publishing developed the StreamSend Email marketing service. This service enables StreamSend users to send out eye-catching emails and, just as importantly, track the results. The response to StreamSend has been extraordinary, and this service has become EZ Publishing’s flagship product. Since EZ Publishing has a talented core of developers, clients started asking them to develop Web-based solutions to automate processes and unify business resources. The company now has a solid portfolio of custom Web applications and a growing base of custom development customers. EZ Publishing continues to refine and expand its services, while at the same time maintaining an intense focus on Internet technology solutions. The company’s goals for the future include maintaining its present rate of robust and sustainable growth.","Content and Publishing, Information Technology, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Other, Sales and Marketing, Software",1,Dan Forootan,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Fred B. Anschutz's (1909-1993) career was characterized by uncanny and intuitive foresight and by a willingness to enter into ventures others considered too risky. His first business success came through striking a rich oil field in his home state of Kansas. Earnings from an oil exploration business that eventually spanned Kansas, Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming were parlayed into ranches and livestock operations across the West. The family and their business headquarters moved from Wichita to Denver in the 1960's. Marian P. Anschutz (1910-1986) with husband, Fred, ingrained traditional American values of hard work, community involvement and love of the land in their children and grandchildren.  Sue Anschutz-Rodgers has continued her parents' legacy through her own business and ranching ventures and commitment to philanthropy. The Foundation's assets have grown over its 34 year history from the original $4.5 million endowment to $56.4 million through investments and additional family contributions. Sue served as the Foundation's first President and Executive Director and currently serves as its Chair and President. Four of the founders' six grandchildren and two great grandchildren serve as trustees of the Foundation, while granddaughter Susan Rodgers Drumm served as program officer from 1994-2001.  Since its inception, the Foundation has distributed 8,671 grants to nonprofit organizations for a total of $50,183,941. The Foundation's focus on supporting organizations that meet human and community needs in Colorado has remained steady throughout its existence. In the early years, the Foundation funded fewer organizations with larger grants. Gradually, the philosophy shifted to providing smaller grants ($2,500-$10,000) to many organizations. The intent was to spread the Foundation's resources into more areas and to encourage nonprofits to develop diversified funding streams. Although the primary activity of the Foundation is grant making, considerable energy has and will be directed to efforts to build the capacity of Colorado's nonprofit sector, to enhance grant making, and to work collaboratively with other funders.  In the early 1990's, the Foundation partnered with the Community Resource Center to orchestrate Colorado Rural Philanthropy Days, a twice-yearly event that built on an initiative of the nonprofit community in Mesa County. Sue's vision in launching this event, which is still going strong today, was to increase foundation support to rural areas of the state. The intent is for private and public funders, who are concentrated in the Front Range, to visit Colorado's rural communities to gain a greater understanding of the issues and challenges faced in those communities and to facilitate introductions between metro-based funders and Colorado's rural nonprofit leaders and local elected officials. Colorado Rural Philanthropy Days address two of the Foundation's goals: to increase funding to nonprofit organizations in rural Colorado and to demystify the grant-making process.  The Foundation plans to continue on its current path of embracing opportunities that enhance the nonprofit sector and focusing on organizations that strengthen families and communities and assist people to help themselves.","Community and Lifestyle, Other, Social Impact",,,101-250,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

After settling in America, Carl became an apprentice who attended technical school at night and on the weekends. Eventually, Carl became the proprietor of his own meat market. During his proprietorship, he realized the need for a practical machine which would cut meat more efficiently. Thus, in 1921, unable to ignore his ambitions of creating a practical meat cutter, Carl decided to dispose of his meat market so that he could devote more time to his concept. He leased an old church and used the equipment which was available and affordable at the time to pursue his ""American Dream"" and produce the first BIRO Power Meat, Fish and Bone Cutter.

The service is an add-on for existing email addresses and accounts. It currently supports Gmail (along with whole domains through Google Apps), Yahoo! Mail, and AOL. Once Boxbe is configured, email messages are automatically prioritized and screened as they arrive. Priority is based primarily upon the sender's identity. A member's priority list is automatically updated, and can also be viewed and edited directly. The company performs several checks to verify the authenticity of email senders. Some messages are modified to provide navigation links when delivered. A controversial aspect of the service is its 'Courtesy Notice', a short email notice sent in behalf of a member to the sender of a message when they are unknown. The notice provides the sender with a link that lets them have their message ""promoted"". The service also encourages its members to invite their friends, claiming that doing so will improve the handling and priority given to email through its ""Friend of Friend"" feature. Perhaps due to poorly worded screens or navigation, some members have been angered when they inadvertently invite their entire address books. Consequently, Boxbe has been accused of creating spam to promote their service.","Information Technology, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Messaging and Telecommunications",1,Thede Loder,1-10,1,M&A,1500000,USD,1500000,1500000,USD,1500000,Esther Dyson,,1,,Private,,,,,,
