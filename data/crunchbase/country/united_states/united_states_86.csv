There are 5 crucial features within the SAS safety system that will aid in your personal and families safety. We intend on developing the SAS App across the following mobile platforms: iPhone, Android, Blackberry, iPad & Android Tablets. 5 Key Features of the SAS App: Emergency Countdown - Seconds away from notifying help! Groups - Notify your friends, family, teachers & co-workers of your safety! Monitor Me - The SAS App will check-in with YOU to verify your safety! Alert Mode - Call 911 & your Emergency Contacts simultaneously! Personal Emergency QR Codes - Your very own customizable Digital ID Card! This endeavor was initially started due to the CEO's personal experience with losing a friend to a terrible car accident. Her friend was allergic to latex materials and when the EMTs arrived for assistance, she or anyone else was not able to inform them of her allergy. The EMTs proceeded to help the injured girl with latex gloves and materials with latex components in them. The wreck was already bad enough but the latex used on her aided in her death. If her friend would have had the Save A Stranger app or QR sticker for any stranger or the paramedics to obtain her personal and medical information from, she might have survived this tragic accident.  My business partner and I know this all too well from hearing sad stories of individuals who needed immediate assistance for various reasons such as protection from predators, medical attention, old age, accidental injury, and so much more. Stories and incidents that has hit us too close to home. After this tragedy we learned about many lives that could have been saved ""if only help had arrived in time,"" or ""if only I had a way to help him,"" or ""if the paramedics knew what was wrong with him."" These dreadful moments in ones life are precious seconds that can easily mean the difference between life and death.","Community and Lifestyle, Health Care, Mobile, Platforms, Software, Transportation",2,"Eddie Bardi, Ellie Sedighi",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The new private business incubator will fuse resources, initiative and innovation for the purpose of cultivating vibrant small businesses that will renew America and create jobs as they grow. Main Street Stark plans to launch a dozen new operations in the first half of 2011. Main Street Stark will have both a physical presence in the community as well as a virtual storefront on the internet. Mentors from Stark County as well as the rest of the USA will nurture individuals wanting to partner with seasoned business veterans from the private sector. According to Jeff 'SKI' Kinsey, Entrepreneur in Residence, ""Local job creation is a natural side effect of small business formation—done right and done well—under the tutelage of like minded individuals."" The Main Street Stark web site includes a wealth of startup business articles and links, including an ""apply"" button to start a dialog. Local and national contributors have been sought out to add value to the site. Other services are planned after the first of the year. ""Support and enthusiasm among the local business community has been outstanding,"" says Kinsey, adding, ""Paying it forward, or paying one's civic rent, is a tradition long observed in Stark County. I am pleased to play a small role in taking it to the next level."" During his career 'SKI' has helped businesses generate millions of dollars in revenue over the internet. After more than ten years of IT/IS consulting, he went back to school to hone his expertise in the areas of process improvement methodologies such as Deming's Total Quality Management (TQM) and Constraints Management Model (CMM). He is also the author of Purple Curve Effect (Throughput Press, copyright 2004), has owned or created more than ten small business, owned a national franchise, and played a major role in three separate leveraged buy-outs (LBOs). However, Kinsey is quick to point out that his career path actually started with 90 days of intense mentoring in San Diego, CA with the ultimate incubator: the United States Marine Corps.","Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Professional Services, Transportation",,,1-10,1,Seed,1000,USD,1000,1000,USD,1000,Jeff SKI Kinsey,,1,,Private,,,,,,
