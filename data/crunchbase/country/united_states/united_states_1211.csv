We strive to offer employers a fast, effective, and drug-free solution to help their employees recover from an injury, manage chronic pain and arthritic pain, relieve muscle tension and soreness and more.   Soovu began when Drs. Charles Chabal and Peter Dunbar, board-certified physicians in pain management at the University of Washington, were personally moved by witnessing the tragedy opioids wrought on patients and their families. They challenged themselves: could there be a new, drug-free approach to treating chronic pain? With 10+ years of R&D and a $1.5 million grant from the National Institutes of Health, the doctors created, refined and tested Soovu. The result: the only wearable using heat pulses that is clinically proven to reduce chronic, musculoskeletal and menstrual pain and is FDA registered. This rechargeable pod is at the center of our pain relief system. It emits precise heat pulses to stop the pain signal and produce a soothing effect. Attached to the pain point with a disposable adhesive, pods can be worn discreetly throughout the day.
