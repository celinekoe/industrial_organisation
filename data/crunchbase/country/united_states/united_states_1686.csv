The Company was founded in Nov-2009, before anyone had heard of Groupon, LivingSocial or any of the other now-famous online coupon companies. The Company incorporated in Jun-2010 and raised a seed round of capital in Jul-2010. In Oct-2010 the Company launched its online coupon platform at Coupeez.com, focusing its local market in Ventura (Southern California). Coupeez was doing so well in the marketplace with its innovative value proposition for both consumers and merchants that the Company raised an angel round of capital in Dec-2010 to take the platform national and build iPhone and Android apps. By this time Groupon and LivingSocial had emerged as major players in the space, soon raising hundreds-of-millions of dollars, but Coupeez kept at it, growing its platform.   By the winter of 2011 it became obvious that the Groupons of the world were going to own the online coupon space, so Coupeez had to decide whether to shut down the Company or pivot to something new. By this time the Founder/CEO was funding the Company entirely on his own. The Company decided to pivot. All 15 investors have been rolled into the new company, iCrumz. They owned a certain percentage of Coupeez, and after the pivot they owned the same percentage of iCrumz.   With the pivot the Company set out solve a problem that plagues every Internet user in the world. The Company spent 18 months in stealth building iCrumz, a personal dashboard for your digital world. iCrumz automatically organizes the most important parts of your online life. The Company has massive potential to become a multi-billion dollar business and fundamentally disrupt and improve the way that people discover, organize, access and share the world's information. With iCrumz you have one-click access to all your favorite websites, files (on your computer or in the cloud) and other digital content. It curates the most important information in your social graph and gives you direct access to everything through your iCrumz dashboard, which you can access from any Internet-connected device. iCrumz is also ideal for sharing content, either directly or by letting others subscribe to your iCrumz collections.",Commerce and Shopping,1,Matthew Graczyk,1-10,1,Seed,1000000,USD,1000000,1000000,USD,1000000,,,,,Private,,,,,,
