Give The Reckoner your knottiest problems, and it'll use the power of Democracy and crowdsourcing to untie them. One of the best recent developments of the internet has been the redemption of the Q&A site, which has conclusively proven that you can ask the internet for advice and actually get valuable responses.  With Stack Exchange, Quora, and AskMetafilter, we've seen Q&A sites thrive by building a community that provides a safe environment where expertise is valued.  Internet polling, however, is still stuck in 1998, and most large-scale internet polls are considered an afterthought of dubious veracity.   The Reckoner seeks to change that by establishing the same community standards that have made the modern Q&A site a success, while uniting community this with a clear editorial voice that gives the site both entertainment and informational value. With a question on The Reckoner, you get the best of both worlds -- the clarity of a poll answer with the depth of the comments and justifications from real, respected, non-anonymized community members.","Data and Analytics, Design, Financial Services, Other",1,Daniel Koch,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
