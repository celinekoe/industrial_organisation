SMA affects approximately 1 in 10,000 babies, and about 1 in every 50 Americans is a genetic carriers. SMA can affect any race or gender. There are four primary types of SMA—I, II, III, and IV—based on age of onset and highest physical milestone achieved.

However, SMA does not affect a person’s ability to think, learn, and build relationships with others. Though there is currently no approved treatment for SMA, there’s great reason for hope.

Over the years, ICV has grown to become a recognized leader in live event video production and webcasting. Corporate and commercial video production and video studio rentals to the San Francisco Bay Area and the Silicon Valley media market rounds out ICV's services.  ICV remains focused on providing personalized attention to every client and their projects. And thanks to the talented people that have become the ICV family, it's worked out great. In 1999 we designed and built our Studio and moved out of our small rented space. The Pleasanton facility was designed to be an open and spacious 8500 sq. ft office / studio with open offices, lots of creative space and something most video production companies do NOT have ""in-house""; our own 2500 sq. ft. video production studio sound stage. Our full Cyc walls and Lighting Grid make green screen compositing easy. San Francisco video production companies, and San Jose video producers use our video studio for their productions. When they're shooting in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles video production companies, advertising agencies and producers use our video studio, audio booth, High Definition HK3800 video cameras, our HD-SDI Mobile video flypacks, edit on one of our 3 Final Cut/Premier Pro editing suites or utilize our creative web design / writing / graphics / production crew and staff to complete their projects. Using their proprietary live webcasting platform, V3, ICV provides not only the video production for any size event, but also provides a custom branded event or company media portal using any web address, with secure, responsive video players with chat, Q and A and synchronized slides along with full HD video streaming. Using V3 ICV can build and launch an integrated media portal in minutes and be streaming live on location anywhere immediately.  Content hosting, all A/V and video staff and gear and of course the video streaming using a global CDN is all managed by ICV. No customer staff or resources are required. Corporate staff can quickly learn how to build and deploy event or company meeting webcast portals themselves within V3. Once the media portal for the webcast has been published, a request is sent for ICV to staff the event and manage the complete video production.  Tools for management of live events and conferences covers user registration and management, speaker bios and photos, customizable agendas and session descriptions. The V3 platform provides monetization tools such as display advertising, and e-commerce sales supporting all major payment gateways to sell attendance of  both live webcast events or to view on-demand archives of content at a single URL, within a web site that the client can control.  Producers that wish to sell webcasting can white label V3 and deploy and manage the webcasts themselves within V32 in their own separate company portal where they can manage multiple customer webcast profiles while utilizing ICV's video production and webcast encoding services to resell webcast production. Since the beginning, we’ve used state-of-the-art technology and innovative design concepts to create compelling videos, effective web content and exciting digital media. Our ability to go anywhere in the world on a moments notice and produce webcast events and web portals with 100% confidence has gained us the trust of our clients. Because we refuse to be pushed into a niche, ICV has evolved into a unique full-service interactive media studio offering video production, webcasting and web development. We use all of those skills to help our clients market and develop their online strategies. From our company built and owned interactive media studio in Pleasanton, CA we serve the San Francisco Bay Area, San Jose, Silicon Valley and beyond.
