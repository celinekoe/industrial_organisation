Like most people, he struggled through years of working in a vast, unfeeling bureaucracy. After the backstabbing and gossip of the university system threw him out of his job, he was “totally devastated” – stranded far away from home without a paycheck coming in. Despite having to hang on to survival with his fingernails, he didn’t just survive – he thrived. He says that getting fired with no safety net was the best thing that ever happened to him. Despite the stress, it gave him an opportunity to rebuild and redesign his life. One year after being on the edge of financial ruin, Jonathan had replaced his job and was working as a six-figure SEO consultant. But with his Rolodex overflowing with local businesses and their demands getting higher, he knew that he had to take his hands off the wheel. That’s one of the big takeaways from his experience. Lifestyle design can’t just be about replacing one job with another. Oftentimes, you’re just replicating the stress and misery that came with that lifestyle! Thanks to smart planning and personal discipline, Jonathan once again started from scratch, this time with a focus on repeatable, passive income that created lifestyle freedom. In a short while, he was more successful than he could have ever possibly expected. He traveled the world, helped friends and family, and moved to an island in the South Pacific. Today, he’s devoted himself to breaking down every hurdle that entrepreneurs face at every stage of their development, from building mental strength and resilience in the depths of depression and anxiety, to improving financial and business literacy, to developing a concrete plan to escape the 9-to-5 – all the way down to the nitty-gritty details of teaching what you need to know to build a business of your own. In a digital world packed with “experts,” few people have the experience to tell you how things work, why they work, and what’s actually working in the online business world right now. Jonathan doesn’t just have the experience. A best-selling author, a ”Ghostwriter to the Gurus” who commands sky-high rates due to his ability to deliver captivating work in a hurry, and a video producer who helps small businesses share their skills with their communities – he has experience in a variety of spaces. He’s also the founder of the Serve No Master podcast, a weekly show focused on financial independence, networking with the world’s most influential people, writing epic blog posts online, and traveling the world for cheap. Altogether, his experience makes him one of the most captivating and accomplished people in the lifestyle design world. He has dedicated his life to sharing the best of what he knows with total transparency as part of his mission to free regular people from the 9-to-5 and live on their own terms.

It is currently developing solutions for the indication Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). The fungus Pneumocystis commonly resides in the lungs of healthy individuals, but the infection PCP does not arise until a person’s immune system is depressed at which time the Pneumocystis pathogens can replicate and cause an infection. PCP is the most common opportunistic infection in HIV/AIDS patients. It also affects other immunocompromised patients including those less than two years of age and over seventy years of age and those undergoing cancer treatment, immunosuppression for organ transplant surgery, corticosteroid treatment, or other immunosuppressive therapy.After infection occurs, PCP has a high mortality rate. MiniVax’s lead product candidate is a monoclonal antibody (PCP-Antibody) for the treatment of PCP. For those patients already suffering from PCP that are plagued by an average mortality rate of 20%, PCP-Antibody will provide an immediate defense against PC by delivering the antibodies needed to fight off the infection and thereby reducing the risk of mortality. A follow on product is a novel vaccine (PCP-Vaccine) for the prevention of PCP. PCP-Vaccine promotes the development of long term anti-Pneumocystis antibodies in patients receiving the vaccine. The antibodies help immunocompromised patients prevent Pneumocystis infection and, therefore, prevent PCP development. Similar to childhood vaccinations, one multi-dose regimen of PCP-Vaccine will be needed to confer lifetime protection. In addition to the therapeutic antibody and vaccine, MiniVax is developing a diagnostic (PCP-Diagnostic) for the detection of a Pneumocystis infection. Currently, clinical diagnosis of PCP is limited to immunohistochemistry and examination of chest X-rays, which have limited sensitivity, specificity, and speed. It takes a highly experienced physician to diagnose PCP. PCP-Diagnostic will provide a quick and accurate means of diagnosing PCP, thus ensuring that the appropriate treatment is prescribed in a timely manner. The preliminary technology for MiniVax’s PCP products was developed by Dr. Jay Kolls and Dr. Mingquan Zheng at Louisiana State University Health and Science Center (LSUHSC). Drs. Kolls and Zheng initially studied an immunogenic protein in Pneumocystis called Kexin, which provided protection against Pneumocystis in initial animal studies. Approximately five years and $4 million were spent in the lab developing this technology before MiniVax became operational in mid-2011. Currently, MiniVax is further developing the technology through federal and state grants.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",2,"A.
