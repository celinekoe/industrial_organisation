The ‘725 patent, 550 pages long, elaborated on ideas in the first filing, providing additional disclosures. It eventually yielded another ten patents, issuing from 1990-1999. ​ All of PMC’s patents share priority dates with those two patents from 1981 or 1987. Delays from the US Patent Office, however, meant that the bulk of PMC’s portfolio did not begin issuing until 2010. These early priority dates coupled with terms extending until at least the late 2020’s give PMC’s patents an incomparably long coverage span in their fields.
