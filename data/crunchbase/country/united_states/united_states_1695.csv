Hometown Workforce,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/hometown-workforce,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Construction, E-Commerce, Marketplace, Software, Training","Biloxi, Mississippi, United States","Our A.I assistant can find someone to take care of your problem, get a price for the service, and give you a few start times to choose from.","112,333",Southern US,,Active,2022-03-30,day,,,,,For Profit,https://www.wfskills.com,"Imagine an A.I assistant that can find someone qualified to take care of your problem, get an estimated price for the service, and give you a few start times to choose from.  Does this conversation sound familiar? I have this problem at ZIP code 39531. Can you fix it, when can you fix it and how much will it cost? Our A.I replies to that request with answers to each part. Example service request: “39531 toilet won’t flush” Example A.I assistant reply: Service Name: Toilet Repair (Won't Flush, Running, Clog) Estimated Price: $85 Soonest Arrival Window: 10/18 Thur, 9:00am-10:00am Click here to order this service Or find similar services here  Hometown Workforce is like DoorDash for services with an A.I assistant that helps consumers hire service providers. These people create a series of service listings on our marketplace. Consumers then pick the service they need, choose an available start time, and deposit 1% of the estimated total down. This 1% contractually obligates the person to show up on time and complete the work for the price estimated. If they don't they risk losing access to the platform.  This order process also runs the person's entire business. It manages payments, provides jobs, and schedules those jobs. All the person has to do is show up on time and do a good job. In exchange for this commitment to being honest and reliable, our tech can turn the skills of virtually anyone regardless of race, gender, background, or circumstances into a successful business. Angie's List and all the other lead gen sites do one thing. They connect consumers with contractors. They can't schedule the job. They can't verify the quality of work and they can't verify the price is fair. Without all 4 you can't effectively help consumers complete jobs. We take care of all 4 and more! MISSION STATEMENT: Our mission is to help eliminate poverty by turning people's skills into successful businesses. This is the first true solution to poverty I'm aware of. It's also perhaps the most powerful tool ever conceived for incentivizing people to be honest and reliable.  HOW OUR TECHNOLOGY WORKS: What makes this platform truly revolutionary is the series of listings people create on our marketplace. These listings pre-price and pre-timed their individual services.  Since each service is pre-priced we can standardize prices which eliminates price gouging, it also ensures the person gets paid.  Since each service is pre-timed the consumer can look at the person's work calendar and see all the available openings with enough hours to accommodate the specific job. Then they pick one which ensures the person shows up on time. It also provides them with jobs and manages every hour of every day. It tells the person where to go, what to do, and when to be there. There are billions of ordinary people who have skills people will pay for. They just have no idea how to turn those skills into a successful business. That’s exactly what Hometown Workforce does! We also have a training division that can provide people with skills. You choose a trade, we partner you with an instructor who will create listings specific to your career path. Consumers order those services and after you learn to do the work on the job. All the listings are turned over to you and instantly you have a successful business.

ATTWILL has filed 8 patents on two technologies and has one patent issued for a core technology. The two core vascular access technologies are novel devices. One device sterilizes the inner lumen of devices. CHGLock is a connector device for delivering Chlorhexdine (antimicrobial) into the lumen of catheters during the locking of catheters. Its goal is to eliminate bacteria inside catheters. ATHLock is a connector device that delivers novel antithrombin and heparin (anticoagulant) into the inner lumen of catheters during the locking of catheters. The goal of ATHLock is to prevent blood clots inside the catheters. These two technologies have been licensed to ICU Medical Inc. for world wide distribution. ICU Medical is the market leader in catheter connector valve technologies. ICU is a NASDAQ listed company. ATH is a platform technology that can be used where heparin is currently being used as an anticoagulant. It can be applied as a coating to devices, such as catheters and VADs (ventricular assist devices) where blood clotting on the device is potentially harmful to the patient.
