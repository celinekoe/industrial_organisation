Typical third-party systems often forgo expensive point-of-sale (POS) integration and instead phone the restaurant, fax in orders or send orders via email. Teburu makes POS integration a more affordable option, or restaurants can opt for the company's specially designed Android tablet application which runs on locked-down mobile hardware and software. The app will alert order takers to incoming orders via flashes or beeps. Then staff simply inputs the order in their own system or prints directly to the kitchen. The overall goal is to provide SMBs with the same level of control over their menus and online ordering presence as larger companies have. The product will be white-labeled so restaurants can control own branding. A mobile app framework is also in development which would allow restaurants to take orders via a branded mobile application.","Commerce and Shopping, Food and Beverage, Mobile, Software",2,"Greg Ross-Munro, Leon McIntosh",11-50,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,Gazelle Lab,,1,,Private,,,,,,

Search Engine Optimization, also known as SEO, is a multi-stage strategy used to optimize your website on the internet to improve overall visibility and increase its page ranking on the top 3 search engines – Google, Yahoo and Bing. When an internet search is done for your goods or services, the objective is to have your website on the first page of the search engine results. We use social media platforms to maximize a company’s media exposure.  Our main focus is Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, and we use these platforms with masterful efficiency.  If you’re not building new customers and monetizing social media, then it’s time to take action before you miss the boat and your competitors leave you in the dust. With three quarters of companies in America using social media, and only 20% of those getting the results they want, you need an expert at your side to make sure you’re not losing time and money. Blitz Mogul’s proprietary Consumer Targeting Program can help target and retarget the perfect customer.  To be extreme, let’s say your target market is bilingual left handed men between the ages of 15 and 35 who read Japanese comics and love vanilla ice cream.  Okay.  No problem.   We can make sure that they, and only they, see your advertisement.  Our software will make sure they see it at whatever time of day you want, on which ever genre of site you want (big names like Facebook, Yahoo, and CNN, or small niche websites we’ve never even heard of).  They’ll see it as frequently as you want, for as long as you want. Blitz Mogul produces online videos for product marketing, promotions and training.

Their primary focus is on short and medium-length books: topics and arguments that can’t comfortably fit in a long article, but which can delve into a subject thoroughly and explore it accessibly in around 100 to 150 pages. Their books tackle all different aspects of film culture, form director and genre studies, to explorations of individual films, to biographies, and even topics like an oral history of video stores as told by prominent filmmakers. All of their books are available in print and ebook formats, both on their website and from major retailers and wholesalers like Amazon and Ingram.    In their first year, they have assembled a strong list of upcoming titles, and have already released three books which showcase the range of writing they will be publishing. They have spent over $70,000 of their own funds to build their list and develop their production and marketing infrastructure. However, the real challenge in the next year will be to effectively sell the many great titles they will be releasing, and funds raised will primarily be used toward hiring an experienced sales manager, developing an effective advertising strategy, and building up their boookseller contacts and resources.    They believe that this particular niche - short, smart (but not overly academic) books about film - has a strong, mature audience, and given the right tools and support the Press could be a long-lived, sustainable enterprise that can eventually yield healthy annual returns and even grow its lists to cover similar, related areas of culture (music, literature, etc.).","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
