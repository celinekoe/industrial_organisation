The daily fantasy sports industry is an explosive phenomenon still in its formative phase. The top two companies, Fanduel and DraftKings, have raised over $150 million in venture capital in the past six months, with total post money valuations of $700 million. The investor list is blue chip, including KKR, Shamrock, Raine Group, Redpoint Ventures and NBC. Nearly all of this new capital has been spent for customer acquisition, with the majority focused on sports television advertising. The target market of young (30’s) males has been well educated on the availability of this exciting form of gaming.    Daily fantasy sports contests are considered skill based gaming – not gambling – and are legal in 45 of the 50 U. S. states. Moreover, the professional sports leagues and teams have fully endorsed the fledging business, securing sponsorships and encouraging fan engagement. Very importantly, fantasy sports are specifically carved out of, and do not apply to, the Federal Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006.     FanWars LLC has teamed up with DraftDay.com, the number three daily fantasy sports site. DraftDay was one of the earliest sites and has a very secure and robust technology platform, coupled with a large amount of player activity. Outside of the top two companies, DraftDay is the only site offering multiple sports and game styles in quantities sufficient to keep player involvement. This player activity, or liquidity, is measured by funds on deposit, prizes paid and other metrics. Liquidity is THE criterion separating success from failure. DraftDay has achieved and maintained its success with excellent customer service, great user interface, and good branding.
