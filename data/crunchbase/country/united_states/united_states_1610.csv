Employees start the day with their Daily Questionnaire prior to entering the building.  All submitted info is sent to HR/Admin in the CT Portal.  As employees enter the Geofenced building, the solution starts tracing their interaction with other employees.  If they come within the 6-foot proximity of each other, they are alerted through LED lights and vibration, and their contact is logged in the CT Portal.  If any of their contacts report symptoms or a positive test result in the next 14-18 days, a notification is sent to them and HR/Admin about a possible risk of exposure.   HR/Admins have access to the CT Portal through various roles.  This helps authorized personnel to manage employees with their Daily PPE/Questionnaire and temperature checks that employees need to follow. HR/Admins are provided access to maintain and edit employees, locations, equipment, and reporting.  Authorized HR/Admins will have access to edit the status of employees.  If an employee recovers from the virus, HR/Admin has the ability to reset their status to Safe after receiving their updated test results. All of this is controlled through integration and APIs in the CT Portal.  From customizing the mobile app and extension URLs, to running reports on employee surveys and status, the CT Portal provide HR and Admins the ability to manage their companies and minimize possible risk of exposure within their employee base.","Apps, Mobile, Software",1,Varchasvi Shankar,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
