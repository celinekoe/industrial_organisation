Grand Incentives received notification of what was viewed within 6 minutes of the video download while the plane was still in flight 300 miles off the coast of Africa.  The sales team was then able to tailor an email and phone call directly to the prospect upon landing. The company culture and IT approach is one of visionaries versus followers.
