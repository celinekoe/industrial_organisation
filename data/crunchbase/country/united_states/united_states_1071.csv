MedaDoc does not replace existing systems, rather we enable the existing systems to deliver on the unkept promises that were made when these systems were implemented. Namely: 1. Reduced administrative costs 2. Reduced workload for Doctors 3. Increased time with patients, more attention to patient health 4. Increased revenue and reimbursements 5. Improved communication within and between HealthCare providers 6. Accurate and Reliable: Clinical, Administrative and Billing information available at the right time to the right person at the right place. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) instituted carrots and sticks to “encourage” Health Care Providers to adopt and use Electronic HealthCare Systems, They intended that it would save time and money and increase the flow and availability of critical information. However, the exact opposite has happened. Namely, health care providers from the (dwindling) solo-doctor practices to the largest groups and hospitals, are using multiple systems in their day to day workflow.  ​ It is for this reason that MedaDoc has developed a technology that is able to move and replicate data seamlessly from and to any EHR and Practice Management system - without needing access to the back end or database or server or even need to talk to the IT department.","Health Care, Information Technology",2,"Ian Aronovich, Ilya Aronovich",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
