The Propelics founders, Adam, Eric, Larry, and Shahab have been in the enterprise tech business since the early 90’s. Over twenty years have passed since they first explored process and functionality redesign, built desktop app prototypes to understand new processes, and discovered the benefits of a fixed-time & price engagement model. Their journey into enterprise mobile was forged over decades spent pioneering transformational changes in how large businesses use data—first in the migration from mainframe terminals to 3-tiered distributed client systems, followed by ultra- light interfaces and an emphasis on user-experience. Next with building distributed workforces—CRM systems that connect remote sales and field-service teams. And finally constructing data warehousing, ODS, and SOA strategies to ensure sensitive data always made it to the right people. Having worked exhaustively with complex enterprise processes gave the founders an appreciation for all that mobile could accomplish in the same space. In 2011, they founded Propelics and used this expertise to re-define Mobile Strategy. The world of Enterprise Mobility would never be the same. Their mission: to consistently achieve what no other company could even dream of: brief, fixed-price engagements, at the conclusion of which the client would be equipped with a Mobile Strategy or Mobile Center of Excellence, along with the Mobile App itself—complete with wireframes, design, and a working, on-device prototype. Today Propelics is a rare breed: a solid leader in the still-young business of Enterprise Mobility; trusted by the world’s largest brands. We established the Mobile Research Council as a way to welcome newcomers to the community and feel honored at having the opportunity to form long-lasting global partnerships. In addition, the team has created a development capability worthy of our strategic guidance—including app delivery, mobile testing and support desk, as well as ready-built SaaS products to shorten our clients’ time-to-market in delivery enterprise mobile solutions to their employees & partners. Nothing makes us happier than knowing our work is so highly regarded around the world.","Information Technology, Mobile, Sales and Marketing, Software",4,"Adam Bookman, Eric Carlson, Larry Lauvray, Shahab Choudhry",11-50,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
