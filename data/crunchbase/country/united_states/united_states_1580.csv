This coincided with the development of one of the first Internet Mail Order operations, eventually evolving into a specialist digital delivery platform, in tandem with a sister technology company, Filmed Media.  Channel Films have downsized over the years to 4 Film Rental shops in Ladbroke Grove, Maida Vale, Queens Park and Camden Town, being the only London Chain remaining besides Blockbuster.  As the physical Film Rental sector has diminished, the business has continued to develop it's on-line presence in the Internet VOD sector, with access to independent content from around 15 distributors, via Filmed Media.","Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Video",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

It became the city’s first law practice, and one of the nation’s first, to institute telecommuting, which enabled staff members, including new parents, to work at home. Brewer & Pritchard pioneered the all-digital law library in Houston, commissioning a specially constructed CD-ROM tower in 1994. The following year, the leaders of the practice purchased a domain name to create the first active website for an area law firm. In addition, Brewer & Pritchard became paperless at the beginning of the millennium, long before state and federal courts mandated electronic filings. The firm’s attorneys possess expertise in a wide range of practice areas, including corporate and securities, mergers and acquisitions, real estate, construction, insurance, and product liability, as well as in general business and financial and commercial matters. Brewer & Pritchard handles all phases of initial public offerings, internal corporate organization, U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission filings, and state and federal reporting. For mergers and acquisitions, the attorneys assess and recommend the most advantageous business combinations; write letters of intent; prepare confidentiality, asset purchase, and stock-exchange agreements; and conduct due-diligence investigations. They perform all duties necessary to close transactions. Cofounder and Principal J. Mark Brewer has acted as Managing Director of the practice since its inception. Recognized world-wide for his litigation and resolution skills in high-rise commercial-building defect and design cases, he has worked in state, federal, and Judge Advocate General courts, and he has won numerous jury verdicts with awards in the multimillions. Cofounder Thomas C. Pritchard, who leads the practice areas of mergers and acquisitions and corporate/securities, has closed more than $400 million in financing for clients in his two-decade career. Brewer & Pritchard, which also includes principal Sondra Jones Jurica and several associate attorneys, has held the prestigious AV peer-review rating with Martindale-Hubbell every year since 1992. CV, BV and AV are registered certification marks of Reed Elsevier Properties Inc., used in accordance with the Martindale-Hubbell certification procedures, standards, and policies.

Of course, there will also be other tools and methods that we exploit to boost the productivity of project engineering teams with affordable, real-time 3D collaboration and simulation, quantitative critical parameter management and data visualization.   Our approach is rooted in our belief that successful product launch is a matter of plugging in the power of all project engineering team interactions with customers representatives, R&D and lab partners, supply chain partners, manufacturing partners, marketing and distribution chain personnel and other launch-critical players involved in product development and launch.   If we can more effectively master the virtual CAD realm by understanding the criticality of customer requirements and supplier capabilities, fewer resources will be wasted on failed product launches.

And that is what counts in the end.","Content and Publishing, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Other, Software",1,Athul Jayaram,1-10,2,Early Stage Venture,1000,USD,1000,1000,USD,1000,Athul Jayaram,,1,,Private,,,,,,
