KnowEm will not only help you secure your name across the vast social media landscape but we can also show you how to contact each site in order to have the name released and returned to you. To date the KnowEm team has helped to reserve over 500,000 profiles and reported back to some of our clients over 65,000 issues of squatting and misrepresentation of a brand, username or trademarked term. This is all done with local employees in New Jersey; we are proud to be a company fully staffed in the United States with absolutely no dependance on offshore outsourcing. Since security is one of our primary concerns, none of your sensitive information is sent overseas. Since April of 2009 KnowEm has been tracking and monitoring hundreds of social media networks populated mostly with user-generated content. Our database of networks is updated frequently as new sites are released and our staff reviews them for quality. We track multiple metrics on these sites to determine which networks are gaining (or losing) traction in the world of social media. By using and storing these metrics we watch for patterns and spikes in traffic and popularity. KnowEm also constantly updates and adds new sites to our vast database of social sites. The next Facebook, Twitter or MySpace is already out there or could be coming soon - do you know which one it will be? KnowEm offers a subscription service (Brand Protection Program) to ensure that you and your brand will not have to worry about it. As new sites emerge we will make sure that your flag is already planted and you will not have to worry about dealing with a squatter or someone who is misrepresenting your social media identity.","Advertising, Information Technology, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Privacy and Security, Sales and Marketing",2,"Barry Wise, Michael Streko",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Private,,,,,,

Have you ever met anyone who went to school and acquired a bunch of book knowledge, and then went out into the real world and had difficulty applying what they had learned to everyday life?    This is the problem opusomni is designed to solve. Opusomni translates book knowledge into lived experience, so people perform education, work, and health management tasks better.    Opusomni is a patented system, rooted in a broad body of evidence in the life sciences about what factors drive performance achievement in authentic environments. We bake that evidence into a mobile device form factor that is easy and fun to use whether you are seven or seventy.    The value proposition for our users is to: (1) facilitate the learner-mentor relationship to drive performance achievement in authentic learning environments; (2) generate meaningful, real-time informatics and analytics using machine learning of the data set to “sort the signal from the noise on the internet” to serve up content to help learners achieve their goals; and (3) stimulate sophisticated research through a massive, elegantly designed structured data set, evidence-based theoretical framework, and powerful learning system to examine and improve performance for our learners.    We have proof of concept through a year-long pilot study conducted at Washington University in St. Louis.    Did you know that 75% of all healthcare costs go to manage chronic diseases?    Yes, that’s right! Yet, today we have no way to effectively manage chronic diseases where people live their everyday lives.    A-teko, the healthcare vertical of the opusomni ecosystem, is Telemedicine 2.0, and will effectively manage chronic diseases where people live their everyday lives. The system is designed to reduce hospital readmission rates, reduce healthcare costs, improve patient satisfaction, and improve patient quality of life.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Education, Health Care, Information Technology, Science and Engineering, Software",1,Beth Ann Wright,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Natural Based/Organics is one of the fastest growing sectors in the beauty  industry. In 2012, U.S. sales in their Industry reached $68.7 billion – and $433.4 billion globally. In the United States alone, growth is slated to reach three to four percent annually within the next five years, according to a Euromonitor International forecast. Niche natural and organic personal care brands are becoming main stream, and as a result are increasingly being sold in drugstores and mass markets such as Target and Ulta, thus attracting consumer base.

Their products are already enjoying acceptance and recognition in the marketplace and have had wonderful reviews in National Magazines and by Beauty Bloggers. Sales have mainly been through their website and a few Spas in Beverly Hills, CA and Sedona, AZ.
