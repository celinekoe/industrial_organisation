The fully-integrated tools make it easy for a team of software developers to collaborate while working anywhere in the world. The management team can monitor the progress and communicate with the programmers using the Devizan management tools. The software deployment and maintenance are designed to be fast and efficient. With its emphasis on transparency, Devizan includes management tools that aren't available in traditional IDEs. The management team can look at the development project at any point in time, and view the changes that were made during the development and maintenance phases. Without relying upon old-fashioned screenshots or keyboard logs, Devizan delivers management-level information about all the changes that have been made to the system under development. Managers can stay as close to the development effort as they choose. Devizan can alert the management team every time a change is made. The task lists, built-in chat system, and status updates keep managers in the loop. The management team can preview all changes before deployment, examine the revision control documents, and call for a rollback of the code if they are not satisfied with the quality of the program release. Devizan features a web-based integrated development environment (IDE) that makes software development collaborative. The IDE supports syntax highlighting, multi-cursor collaborative editing, and built-in FTP for fast and easy uploads. The IDE is browser-based, and includes linear revision controls and edit history. Unlike traditional version-control systems that require checking programs in and out, Devizan lets all developers work in the current copy of the source code. The integration regimen makes it easy to see where one programmer left off and another programmer began. The software's preview function makes it simple to test changes to the code, and back the revised code out if a problem is detected. Devizan uses Amazon AWS servers housed in highly secure data centers. The environment can be customized to fit each Devizan user's needs. Resources are fully scalable, so Devizan users pay for only the resources that they use. The starter rate for a managed development environment with support of up to 10 users costs $15(US) per month. The 100-user plan costs $200 per month. Subscription costs include software updates, technical support, shared hosting costs, bandwidth, and system administration.","Other, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
