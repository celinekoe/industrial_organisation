To get started, simply download the app, rich in privacy settings and features, which puts the user in total control of their personal information, whereabouts and how they want to interact with new people. Then, create a profile by uploading a photo and selecting profile details and interests, including the interests of those the user would like to meet.

They don't have outside investors. This enables us to focus solely on their clients' needs. Supporting those needs means developing best practices to share with their clients, creating features that enable them to succeed, investing in each of their clients' implementations for the long-term, and introducing internal processes at Digital Measures that are efficient and effective. Since they speak the language of people across your campus — from academic affairs and deans offices to institutional research departments to IT organizations, and to faculty — they are able to translate everyone's data management needs into customized system requirements that fit your campus...and then they implement them. As such, you don't need squadrons of programmers involved in implementing your faculty activity reporting solution. They overlay their knowledge of university structures and higher education concepts on top of their technical abilities to ensure each of their clients' implementations meets its specific and varied goals. This focus has made us the de facto standard in faculty activity reporting, as evidenced by their list of who's who clients among universities worldwide. Digital Measures' thought leaders regularly present best practices in faculty activity reporting at multiple conferences each year. Universities, agencies, and governments seek their advice regarding what works when it comes to maximizing the value of faculty activity reporting. Give us a call or send us a note.
