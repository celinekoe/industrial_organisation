Over time, pollutants, mold and bacteria from dirt, pollen, tobacco smoke, pet hair, and dust mites collect in the ductwork of your home's heating and cooling system. Every time your furnace or air conditioner runs, these particles whisk through your vents and spew into the air that your family breathes. On average, air duct cleaning should be done every three to five years. Concealed behind your walls and mostly ignored, your air ducts serve as vital pathways that deliver warm and cool air throughout your home during the year. While they may be unseen, your air ducts are working nearly year round, whenever you have your air conditioner or heater running. Attached to your HVAC system, air ducts transfer the air from these systems throughout your home. What many homeowners don’t realize, though, is that your air ducts, in nearly constant use, continually accumulate dust, grime, debris, pet dander and allergens throughout the year. In fact, according to National Air Duct Cleaners Association the average American home produces 40 pounds of dust per year! Air duct cleaning involves a rather meticulous process to clean out dust, dirt and debris from a central heating and cooling system. Armed with powerful, modern equipment and advanced technical knowledge, our professionals ensure that the job is well done every time!",Real Estate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
