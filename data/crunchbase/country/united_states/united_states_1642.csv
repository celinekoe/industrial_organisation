The program is self-directed and does not require a traditional therapist. Users access the program from a personal computer 24/7. People who used a new on-line post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) program featuring Eye Movement Memory Processing (EMMP) reported, on average, a 43% reduction in PTSD symptoms and PTSD-like symptoms found in victims of traumatic events like combat, domestic violence, sexual abuse, urban violence, rape, and acts of nature. The patent-pending online program for PTSD symptoms and PTSD-like symptoms is offered by ClaytonStress.com, a web-based company founded to provide an online delivery platform for the relief of PTSD symptoms and related conditions.  The EMMP protocols were further refined by psychiatrist Thomas D. Geracioti, Jr., M.D., of the Cincinnati Veterans Administration Medical Center. EMMP is based on research showing that particular patterns of eye movement can be useful in relieving PTSD symptoms and other similar conditions. Comparative effectiveness studies have found that eye movement therapy was as effective as cognitive behavioral therapy in reducing PTSD symptoms.  Dr. Geracioti evaluated the ClaytonStress EMMP protocol with veterans diagnosed with PTSD. Before using the ClaytonStress.com program, the veterans rated their average distress levels at 7.44, on a scale of 1 (minimal stress) to 10 (maximum stress). After the program, the veterans reported average distress levels of 2.87. While the ClaytonStress.com program was in beta testing more than 1,500 individuals used it on-line. This group self-reported an average 43% reduction in their distress levels after a single on-line session. The group included active military, veterans, and non-military civilians.  Users access the ClaytonStress.com secure web site anonymously. No personal information is ever requested, although ClaytonStress.com does ask the userâ€™s military status, age, and gender. No therapist is required to complete the program; it is entirely self-directed. Users need only a computer with a sound card and a quiet place to follow the program protocols. It can also be used as an adjunct to traditional therapy. ClaytonStress.com offers multiple payment options for individual users and accepts credit cards. Personal information is not required for credit cards. A single session costs $10; a three-session plan is $25; a 10-session plan is $65; and a one-year unlimited sessions plan is $95. Users are limited on all plans to two sessions per 24-hour period.","Health Care, Internet Services",,,1-10,1,Seed,75000,USD,75000,75000,USD,75000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Many trends support this expansion even in this down economy worldwide, but one thing is for sure, people around the world continue to focus on their personal care.
