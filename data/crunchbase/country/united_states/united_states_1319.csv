B-Side's primary focus is providing alternative theatrical releases for films for close to zero cost.  Rather than choosing cities, booking theaters, and buying mass media to advertise in local markets, B-Side engages organizations and niche communities as marketing partners through technology and incentives. In April of 2008, B-Side opened the stoner documentary ""Super High Me"" digitally in 1,100 locations on a single day - the widest single day opening for a documentary ever - for less than $10,000.  The film went on to gross over $2M in home video and VOD, making it one of the most profitable documentaries of 2008. B-Side identifies films to distribute through mining of audience data collected at independent film festivals.  The B-Side Festival Genius is a white-label, hosted web service that provides independent film festivals with a turn key online festival schedule.  B-Side's schedule includes rich media and social features - including ratings, reviews, and recommendations - to help audiences plan their festival and discover films.  B-Side currently manages over 200 film festival web sites, including Slamdance, CineVegas, Fantastic Fest, and the Austin Film Festival. Founded in 2005, B-Side is based in Austin, TX, with its Distribution division in New York, NY. B-Side closed on 1 March 2010. From the last blog post: ============== On behalf of the entire B-Side team, I am sad to announce that after 5 years in business B-Side is closing its doors on March 1. The timing is especially disappointing, as the past year has been our best ever. In 2009, we opened our New York office and launched a new distribution business, successfully releasing 8 films. We grew to 220 film festival partners worldwide and started off 2010 with our widely praised Sundance collaboration. Unfortunately, in the face of the lingering economic crisis and ongoing upheaval in the film business, our investors decided to stop funding the company. Under extreme time pressure, we were unable to secure alternate financing, and are left with no choice other than to shut down.
