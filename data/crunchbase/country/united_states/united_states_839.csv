How it works Learning to speak Spanish in Spain is fun, exciting and easy.  The game provides a vehicle for immersive language learning by mimicking the natural and exciting process of learning a language in its native country. By playing a game rather than memorizing cards you use the parts of your brain that record experience and attach emotion to them. This allows you to better understand the language with less effort. Think in Spanish don't translate. La Martina is going to blend the action of a Spy thriller with immersive language learning for an unprecedented interactive experience.   Build your vocabulary walking through cobblestone alleys and elegant Haciendas.

CADWOLF solves all of these problems and more. It is a single platform where users can enter text, solve equations, plot results, and do a number of other things. It has the functionality of Word, Excel, and a programming language in one platform. In addition to these features, CADWOLF tracks units, provides for symbolic equations, and has three dimensional plotting capabilities. Being 100% web based, all that is needed to create, edit, and read a CADWOLF file is a common web browser. In the future, this current platform will be the basis for a first of its kind CAD system which is linked to the design mathematics.

Reput,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/reput-corp,"Android, Apps, Contact Management, iOS, Reputation, Social Media","New York, New York, United States",The network You're already a part of,"2,119,448","Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",Less than $1M,Closed,2013-07-01,day,,,,none,For Profit,http://www.reputapp.com,"Reput is a reputation meeting-point that fuses everyone's online and offline circles for a wider view on others and ourselves. By using Reput users may share their experiences and opinions regarding any of their contacts and may also access what others have said about those specific contacts. --Our reputation will be based again on knowledge and collective wisdom.-- Not long ago, before cities were so crowded, most people lived in closely related communities where information flowed freely, building a collective perception on individuals through direct and second-degree connections. As cities grew, communities became more complex and chances for networking on a 2nd degree became smaller, so the process by which that collective perception was built started to be based on unawareness and contextual (or even one-sided) info. Now, deep into the Internet era, we suffer from the lack of a tool that brings us back to that information flow. There isn’t an easy way to share our experiences and opinions about others. On the other hand, search engines are inefficient when it comes to find information regarding specific individuals because they operate in a wild universe of unstructured data and, thus, combing the results quickly overwhelms the requester. The quality of the info is also jeopardized as a significant amount of search results is frequently sourced from social networks or reputation management services, thus, lacking their credibility. Prestige and reputation in the Internet are highly contextual, and the information about specific individuals available in one network usually stays there. Info doesn’t flow. Unlike in real life, we easily control which networks we are a part of and what information flows within them, making that available info depend on us. --Reput, the social network You are already a part of-- Reput fuses our offline and online circles, getting rid of contextuallity and allowing us to independently interact with others regarding our common contacts. Reput is a giant leap for social networking, and allows information to flow in a very natural way, thanks to the fusion of the different circles in which we all socialize. Reput is a smartphone app that helps us to share experiences and opinions regarding our contacts as well as to get to know them from different perspectives. Once we log in, Reput displays a contact list similar to the one in our device’s default address book, allowing us to access to any of our contacts' Reput (we refer to these contacts as Reputs). There users can: -Rate several aspects of each of their contact’s personality. Statistics of ratings given to each contact will be displayed on each specific contact's Reput. -Participate in their dedicated forums by sharing content and reading what others have shared regarding each one of your specific contacts. Note that users can also hide their nickname while sharing content but that doesn't mean that by using this feature users will become anonymous, they might hide their Nicknames but are fully accountable for content shared. -Vote the accuracy of what’s posted by others. Statistics of ratings given to each entry will be displayed for you to have a wider perspective over available content. -Accessing your Favorite Contacts’ Tab or being updated by push notifications of every new entry made on your favorite contacts’ Reputs, is reserved for Premium users. -Access and participate into your own Reput. Right on top of your Favorite Contacts list you will find your Reput to which you can access to check ratings given to you by others and to participate on your dedicated forum. --Reput respects your contacts' privacy, non of their contacting details will leave your device-- The App’s main feature is that it shows you what others have said about the people in your address book, and it lets you share your own thoughts about these contacts.  To coordinate this sharing of information while reducing the amount of data we collect from you, the App presently utilizes a “hashing” function.  When you first login to the App (and again later, if you click the “Sync Contacts” button), the App automatically sends to Reput a one-way hash of each email address, Facebook ID, LinkedIn ID and (in some cases) phone number of each of the people in your address book. As part of this process, we do not receive the names, photographs, addresses or any other information you have included in your device’s address book — not even in encrypted form. Reput is a closed and private network that really respects privacy within a freedom of opinion and of speech framework. The app encrypts user's content in its origin peer and then decrypts it into its destination peer. In order to increase user accountability for the content they share, in future Reput versions users will have a public profile screen with non identifying information regarding the accuracy of content they shared and their behavior within Reput (average percentage of verity received by their entries, number of reported/shared entries, ...). Users can subscribe a one year access to Reput’s Premium functionalities and, for a limited time, can access them for free through Reput’s Free Premium Access Program in which each user will get an accumulative one-month upgrade to Premium for each user redeeming their coupons. At the same time, each user redeeming a coupon will also get a free one-month upgrade to Premium.","Apps, Information Technology, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Mobile, Platforms, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
