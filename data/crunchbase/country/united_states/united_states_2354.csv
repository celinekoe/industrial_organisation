Their conclusion was simple: finding the right audience for a movie, or TV program requires knowing WHY people like things. Understanding WHY is crucial, because movies and TV programs evoke a variety of feelings and emotions that are complex and these complexities can’t be captured by ratings or rental histories. Knowing that people like the movie The Godfather just isn't enough. To suggest the right movies and TV programs for your market They need to know WHY your audience liked the Godfather -- was it because it was a gangster story or because it was a gripping morality tale? Without knowing which of these is relevant it isn't possible to suggest the right collections.
