What is unique about the Yale Protocol is that after the initial starting insulin dose, ALL DOSES ARE CUSTOMIZED TO THE INDIVIDUAL'S OWN RESPONSE TO INSULIN (INSULIN RESISTANCE). This is because the Yale Protocol takes into account 4 data elements: Current blood sugar, immediate past blood sugar, time between measurements, and current insulin rate. With these data, the Yale-protocol-driven GlucoCare system calculates the rate/velocity of the change in glucose levels, therefore, customizing each dose to the individual patient. There is no prediction of what might happen based on the patient's baseline pre-critical care condition or expected responses to insulin. The protocol is based on the ACTUAL response to insulin in the individual critically ill patient. As critical care clinicians are well aware, predicting what will happen to any individual patient based on the baseline history is not necessarily relevant to the acute critical care setting. Insulin resistance changes based on stress, medications and illness, but most importantly, over time. There is no inherently more accurate way of predicting insulin resistance than actually measuring an individual's response to insulin dosing in that same individual.",Health Care,1,Michael R.
