After 3 years of research we have discovered that the fastest growing demographic is in the west valley of Phoenix where there are no nightclubs other than strip clubs for people to go after a tough week of work and let their hair down. We have also discovered that people want to dance, love rock and roll music, and have a great desire for high quality service in a club atmosphere that is both upbeat and classy. With the stresses of todays society people have a need to spend time relaxing and not have to worry about their problems. Currently we have everything in place to be able to open our doors in a 60 to 90 day window but in order to adequately fund this project it will take $750,000.00 of initial investment (to open the doors) with a total investment of $1.8 to $2.0 million in order to carry us through the first 2 to 3 years of operation in order to build our brand and customer base. Our demographics of this area shows that across 12 zip codes ranging from west of the I-17 to east of the Loop 101 the average income of 50% of the population earns an annual income of between $25k and $75k. This demographic fits right in with our desired customer base which is age 25 to 45 with an annual income of around $30k. By providing what our research shows the customers want (which they are not currently getting) we will be able to establish Drakk's Place as THE place to go on the west side. There is much more to reveal at a later date that will further establish the west side of Phoenix as a major entertainment center and not just another patch of farmland populated by cowboys and beer bars. Our business plan is complete and we are still tweaking the PowerPoint presentation but everything else is just a phone call away.","Community and Lifestyle, Events, Media and Entertainment",,,1-10,1,,,,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

As of 2013, wireless charger sales of $ 180 million. Most of which comes from the mobile phone industry. The agency believes that the next few years, electronic products with wireless charging capabilities tide will occur, including phone, pc, digital camera, and these electronic products will completely get rid of the shackles of power connections, and wireless charging technology will fully gain popularity. It is understood that in 2011 the wireless charging market value of only $ 457 million, and the current global wireless charging market reached $ 2 billion.

It is understood that the current global wireless charging industry, there are three main criteria, which is based on the principle of electromagnetic coupling QI and PMA, and based on electromagnetic resonance of A4WP. In fact, these so-called international standards are technical agreements formed within the Union members, and due to the different advantages and disadvantages of each technology, no one can really be regarded as reliable in the industry currently, you can specify the authority of the entire development of the industry standard. For example, the oldest, most influential industry WPC Union and its QI standards,its technology exceeded 5 years time in the creation and development and not much changed.Despite participating in the league reaches hundreds of businesses, many of them are Google, Qualcomm and other famous enterprises, but the QI standard is still facing many challenges for companies. Many manufacturers concerned about this standard at the same time, also joined other alliances or developing new wireless charging technology. Standard confusion stems from its technically difficult to overcome the drawbacks. Whether it is based on electromagnetic induction or electromagnetic resonance-based, wireless charging technology also exists a low power conversion efficiency, generate electromagnetic radiation, heat, too large and too costly for the state.Drawbacks, limits the promotion and application of wireless charging technology, the so-called proof of these technical standards are not yet mature. In addition, the real core chip wireless charging technology is still in the hands of TI (Texas Instruments), Qualcomm, IDT and other European large chip design company.","Hardware, Mobile",1,Tao Jing,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
