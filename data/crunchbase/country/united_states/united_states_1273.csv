Furthermore, using DataRoll increases the likelyhood a consumer will click-through on a video as much as 2x. Advertisers come to us who are looking to achieve a â€œSmart Buyâ€. We not only provide the interactivity, but we also will help advertisers plan out their media spend through our own network of video publishers. What's different about our network? Unlike larger ad networks, we can use DataRoll to effectively see which publishers have an audience that are willing to interact with a specific brand. If consumers aren't engaging, we can quickly adjust on the fly. All of our publishers are DataRoll certified, meaning their users have showed an exceptional willingness to engage with advertising. No other network can say this. We are attracting new advertisers daily, and our revenue is on a rate in the millions of dollars.

By embracing the social components that power the success of Facebook, twitter, and Foursquare and creating mobile apps that seamlessly build albums from multiple cameras, consumers will have richer connected experiences when using their mobile phone cameras and viewing on the web. My name is Chris Ross, and for over 20yrs, I have used technology to empower businesses and most recently to accelerate user adoption of the same. While the photo sharing category has seen explosive growth, it is still a relatively green field, dominated by cookie cutter services and little recouping of investment.  We aim to change that.  Here is how. Through our website, mobile apps and APIs, consumers effortlessly create public or private albums, invite others to contribute, and share those photos in real-time. Our integration with Facebook and Foursquare brings familiarity and efficiencies to tagging, comments, achievement badges, uploading and location awareness.   Businesses and ""pro-sumers"" too will benefit, subscribing for larger private albums, custom URLs, QR codes and direct feeds to their own systems. In short, we are building a platform that will encompass the best features of the photo sharing services today, and make it easier for the broader consumer market to embrace.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The pellets burn at 10,500 British Thermal Units and are used to augment coal on an 80/20 or 70/30 mix.  The pellets burn at a high rate with very little emission. The potential market includes international power plants in countries that are bound by the Kyoto Protocol, as well as domestic plants that cannot meet EPA guidelines.  Since a wood biomass solution is the part of every country’s Kyoto 2020 plan, there is a massive demand for this type of product. The pellets are currently being produced and burned on a smaller scale.  IBMG plans to substantially increase the production scale to produce 360,000 tons or more per year per plant.  IBMG plans to build five plants over the next five – seven years.  IBMG has spent a great deal of time in Asia building relationships, and has a long-term distribution agreement in place to provide product to several South Korea plants.
