The Institute is committed to a long-term strategic design that outlines the ways and means by which it will fulfill its mission through 2023. The strategic design takes into account the current state, the desired end state, and potential barriers in shaping desired outcomes in three separate but interrelated areas - INPO’s corporate responsibilities, U.S. nuclear industry performance and International nuclear industry performance.  oday the U.S. nuclear industry and INPO can be proud of their decades-long partnership. The industry’s record of progress—in virtually every aspect of safety and reliability— demonstrates how much has been achieved since the TMI accident. Performance indicators reflect significant industry progress in many areas.  But while this hard-earned success is well deserved, the special nature of nuclear technology reminds us that our industry is always judged against the highest of standards. We cannot stand still or think we have accomplished enough, especially at a time when our industry is undergoing rapid change.  This is an exciting time to be a part of the nuclear industry, and a part of INPO. The industry is poised to begin building new plants. Another change is the increasingly global nature of the nuclear business. Additionally, our newest nuclear professionals—younger and more diverse—bring with them great enthusiasm and a fresh perspective that can benefit INPO and the industry.  INPO is preparing its workforce of the future. Founded in 2008, INPO’s chapter of North American Young Generation in Nuclear provides opportunities for young nuclear professionals at INPO and throughout the industry to participate in knowledge transfer, networking and professional development events.","Other, Social Impact",,,101-250,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

For the benefit of our children, we need solutions to our unsustainable agriculture production systems and edible insects is one of the answers. Edible Insects as a serious food source has been gaining acceptance across the US, Canada and Europe. In today’s increased environmental and health conscious world, edible insects make sense to a lot of people and this trend will not slow down as our planet struggles to adapt. Edible insects are an environmentally friendly solution During the past 50 years meat production has tripled and now accounts for nearly 1/3 of all arable land and 1/3 of the fresh water we use. In contrast, insects can be grown vertically in rural or urban environments using a fraction of the land, water and feed needed for meat. Insects can be grown humanely just about anywhere in the world by households, small farmers and large commercial interests. Edible Insects are Healthy  Many edible insects have more protein than beef or salmon and include all essential amino acids. Edible insects are packed with very bio-available vitamins and minerals. They have very strong antioxidant properties. They have more iron than spinach and more calcium than milk and are high in B12 and Omega 3. They are a prebiotic fiber which is nutrients for probiotics. Edible insects are healthy and natural. Edible insects are good for us and good for the planet. Making edible insects a trend here in North America will benefit the world. Entosense is bringing the edible insect experience that people the world over enjoy to restaurants and kitchen tables throughout North America.","Agriculture and Farming, Commerce and Shopping, Food and Beverage, Health Care",2,"Bill Broadbent, Susan Broadbent",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
