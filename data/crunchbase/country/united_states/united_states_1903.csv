While on-site consulting services were fundamental to a significant segment of the client base, there remained those customers who, while in need of technical assistance and instruction, did not necessarily need service delivery through an on-site specialist. With this notion in mind, a new idea was hatched - to offer a range of service options that, while including the traditional consulting approach, would also comprise a wide-range of online offerings -- a virtual consulting engine -- to meet the demands of the more tech-savvy client. The result is the DLZP Solution, a combination of the traditional delivery method coupled with a web-based innovation that provides a more tailored, cost-effective consulting experience. In addition, with the advent of Open Source Software and the expansion of this software into the enterprise, there is a growing need for services to support these applications. At DLZP Group, they see Open Source and ERP applications working together to provide a complete solution.
