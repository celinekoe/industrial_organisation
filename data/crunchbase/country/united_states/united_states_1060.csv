On 7/7/2015 The company launched publicly on product hunt.  https://www.producthunt.com/posts/followperclick As technology kept advancing, we started testing different marketing methods for clients who typically do not comply with Googles advertising policies.  In Feburary of 2017 we started testing our consumer to consumer messages using Iframes for Valentines day.  With a positive feedback, we decided to keep testing the platform for consumers to send messages to other consumers for holidays.   Today we have built our own unique platform, mobile apps, and unique approach to increase conversions for any online advertiser.
