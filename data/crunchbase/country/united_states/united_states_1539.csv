As your attorney, we will help you navigate the complex arena of federal and state laws which provide certain protections and guarantees to your child. With this goal in mind we have developed a law firm guided by three very important principles: Provide excellent legal services; Build solid and trusting relationships with our clients; and Provide “affordable” and “low cost” legal counseling and representation. It is our job as special education attorneys/advocates to become your personal education consultant guiding you through the process of obtaining the appropriate services for your child. This includes, when possible, working collaboratively alongside your child’s school district and/or regional center. As your attorney it is our job to give you the advice, recommendations and support you need to secure the appropriate educational program for your child. We will keep the school district accountable to all applicable federal and state laws through strong advocacy at individualized education program (IEP) meetings, the filing of compliance complaints with the California Department of Education (CDE), filing a due process complaint with the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) and, when necessary, appeals in federal court. In the end, we hope that our representation helps our clients improve their advocacy and negotiation skills so they can better represent their child in future dealings with their school district and regional center. However, we will always be here to take the lead when our clients need us or to answer any questions that may suddenly arise.","Education, Professional Services",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Partnerships extending far and wide are the new lifeblood of the music business. So join us, plant a seed and watch it grow. While other social networking sites are counting friends, we're counting the ways how we can better serve and support aspiring musicians reach their fullest potential, whilst facilitating the creation and cultivation of life-changing relationships between those who make music and those who hope to discover them.

In addition to helping aspiring musicians and working professionals, Munite also endeavors to â€œunite the music worldâ€ in classrooms and educational institutions across America. As budget cuts seem to be inescapable to every educational institution, it is unfortunate that programs for the arts tend to bear the brunt of the budgetary sword. With music education becoming increasingly underfunded in the school system, the likelihood of a well rounded education that includes music is becoming increasingly rareâ€”as well as the benefits that such an education offers.  Keenly aware of the current need to democratize music education, Munite is driven to make music education accessible for all students around the world. With the current trend of many schools turning to the digital classroom to facilitate access to education and knowledge, Munite is prepared to offer various tools at no cost to institutions, educators, and students, in order to facilitate an education in music to everyone who is interested in receiving one.  Everyone can benefit from using Munite. For an educational institution, it can be a priceless tool for pre-screen auditions. With just a click or two, schools can read the prospective studentâ€:tm:s biography as well as listen to audition pieces posted by the student. As pre-screen audition pieces can be accessed through the Munite student services platofrm, CDâ€:tm:s and cassettes will no longer be needed, thereby reducing waste. We will also be offering online live streamsâ€”allowing for auditions to occur in real time, thereby facilitating the interview process for the institution and the prospective student alike.  For educators, Munite offers tools that can assist in the classroom and / or move aspects of the classroom online. Educators can create an online forum, expanding the classroom to the internet. With Mumiixâ„¢ students can collaborate with their fellow students online and create new and exciting music and scores digitally. With Mumiixâ„¢, students will not only gain the knowledge of using online collaboration tools, but will also gain proficiency and awareness of the benefits that technology can play in the creative and professional process whilst preparing them for the twenty-first century.  With an online profile on Munite, students will also learn self promotion. Munite connects musicians and recording artists with labels, managers, and promotersâ€”just to name a few. Since students are able to create biographies and download resourceful media, this creates the opportunity for the music student to market themselves to their prospective employers and/or collaborators. As an online resume, Munite offers the student, musician and artist a professional forum for self promotion and marketing, increasing their exposure to the industry and evaluated experience.","Information Technology, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio, Video",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
