With strong complimentary skill sets, Egretâ€™s partnersâ€™ capabilities stem from their deep backgrounds in corporate strategy, operational management, financial structuring and entrepreneurial investing. These skills, combined with over a quarter of a billion dollars in personal assets, are what Egret brings to every one of its carefully chosen investments. Because they are a closely held partnership, they value integrity, confidentiality and discretion above all else. When they begin working on a potential relationship, there are no press releases, leaks or public announcements. They are happy to sign confidentiality agreements, and insist that all discussions are conducted out of the public glare. In a world of increasingly transient investment vehicles, the principals of Egret are widely known and respected, with many decades of combined experience in founding, funding, and adding value to companies. They live by their reputations, and would be pleased to refer potential partners to the executives who have done business with them. They assure you that the results of any background check will be stellar. That promise is a stark and simple indication of the respect with which they interact with others, and the experiences that they have had with them. Many institutions and organizations are available to provide capital for expanding businesses. What sets Egret apart is their commitment to leverage their skills for the benefit of the company through the comprehensive, structured, value-added approach they bring to their investments. Their process begins with a very careful selection of opportunities. Rather than go broad, they go deep. Before Egret considers an investment they look at every facet of a business, from management to markets, and from products to performance. But numbers are not the only metric they consider, because while important, they rarely tell the full story. Egret looks beyond a companyâ€™s recent financial statements to understand its true potential for the long term. Like their namesake, they are patient and willing to invest their capital and themselves in working with a management team to create substantial enterprise value. At the same time, they have the expertise to move quickly and decisively when the occasion warrants. Because they highly value strong management teams, it is their philosophy to provide significant financial incentives to a companyâ€™s leadership, so that those who contribute to the organizationâ€™s equity growth are the ones who directly benefit from it. Their experience in hundreds of deals has given them the ability to consistently deliver win-win solutions that benefit a companyâ€™s equity owners, its management, its customers and themselves. Once their financial investment is complete, their involvement is just beginning. They work with the managers they are backing to develop appropriate strategies for growth, to implement operational improvements, and to identify add-on acquisition opportunities. In addition, once they have closed on their investments, management may take advantage of their broad and deep base of contacts among journalists and analysts.

Since 1985, FlightTime.com has specialized in providing premium air charter to travelers worldwide. FlightTime.com’s expert knowledge of global air transportation has made us the leading provider of air charter services worldwide. FlightTime.com’s extensive presence with offices in Boston, New York, Washington D.C., Atlanta, Miami, San Francisco, Los Angeles, London, Amsterdam, Bremen, and Milan puts us in a unique position to ensure that even the most complex travel missions, whether domestic or international, are a success. LAS VEGAS, NEVADA, February 2, 2000 Flight Time Corporation, the global leader in air charter, today announced it will acquire Wyvern Ltd., an industry-leading safety and compliance auditing firm, and MACH-1 Software Corporation, a provider of aviation enterprise management software, and rename the company FlightTime.com. FlightTime.com will leverage the well-known safety and superior technology components associated with Wyvern and MACH-1 with the company’s existing e-commerce site AirCharter.com to create the first, audited global aviation network. FlightTime.com also announced it has received substantial financial backing from Southeast Interactive Technology Funds (SEI) and BancBoston Ventures to fund the company’s rapid growth, extensive future technology investments and commitment toward the marketing and distribution of charter going forward. “Until now, the charter industry has lacked a single one-stop resource to find and book aircraft from an aviation network, ” said Robert McBride, president of FlightTime.com. “With these acquisitions and new funds, FlightTime.com will integrate global supply and distribution to create an “end-to-end” network built on a single platform, providing real-time access to a global fleet of audited aircraft residing on a single, intelligent system via the Internet.” The acquisition of Wyvern Ltd. is one component of FlightTime.com’s move to create a seamless and fully integrated solution for the aviation industry by using the company’s extensive expertise and objective information on the safety, quality and service of specific aircraft and operators on four continents. The comprehensive standards of performance provided by Wyvern cover areas of operations, auditing, management and administration, flight operations and maintenance. Wyvern Ltd. will operate independently of FlightTime.com as a wholly-owned subsidiary. “Wyvern reinforces FlightTime.com’s commitment to providing a world-class aviation solution,” said Walter Lamon, III, president of Wyvern Ltd. “They intend to extend the network aggressively over the next eighteen months as part of their goal to create a fully audited network.” “Incorporating Wyvern data into the FlightTime.com business is an important step in their ability to offer global access to the most credible and reliable safety information in the aviation industry, ” said Jane McBride, founder and chief executive officer of Flight Time. “Their clients depend on operators cleared by Wyvern, which is synonymous with quality, safety and reliability.” MACH-1’s advanced technology and design will provide the technological infrastructure for FlightTime.com. MACH-1 is the most advanced software product available to the general and business aviation market that integrates a variety of complex aviation software functions into a seamless system, increasing productivity, supporting extensive business and industry intelligence, and eliminating data-entry duplication. With the acquisition, FlightTime.com has purchased the exclusive global aviation rights to use Visual Knowledge™, the proprietary development platform upon which MACH-1 is built. The unique design of FlightTime.com’s web-based program will allow operators using the network to book aircraft from other operators participating in the system.","Administrative Services, Internet Services, Other, Science and Engineering, Software, Transportation",1,Jane McBride,51-100,2,Early Stage Venture,42430000,USD,42430000,42430000,USD,42430000,"BancBoston Ventures, Southeast Interactive Technology Funds, Axxon Capital, Covestco-Seteura, Amerland Holdings Corporation",1,5,2,Private,,,,,,

FundEazy is the Anti-Fundraiser. As former BSA Scout Masters, the Founders witnessed firsthand teams who could not raise enough money for fees, training, travel, equipment, and other expenses. Dreams can be lost and parents take on a large financial burden to support their children who want to participate in extra-curricular activities, but can't. The Founders saw countless fundraising companies arise that took advantage of the kids and their parents with high fees, unwanted products and the companies retained most of the money collected. The Founders knew they could find a better way to help kids participate in their passions. The Founders built and launched FundEazy, a complete digital way to raise money for youth teams or groups.","Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Sales and Marketing",4,"Brian Bullock, Clinton Jolley, Mathew Cohen, Mathew Cohen",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Designed for quick implementation, ease-of-use, and real-time inventory accuracy, SmartTurn(TM) Inventory and Warehouse Management System provides immediate information on the quantity, location, and status of every inventory item at anytime, anywhere, eliminating costly paperwork errors and streamlining operations. From multiple warehouse locations to individual stockrooms, SmartTurn helps companies maintain a competitive advantage by reducing inventory costs, improving productivity, and increasing customer satisfaction. Only SmartTurn helps companies of all sizes, across all industries know what inventory they have on-hand and where it is located, all in real-time. SmartTurn was originally founded in 2004 as a division of Navis LLC. Navis is the world-wide leading provider of logistics systems for marine container terminal management, yard management, and logistics asset management systems. While working with Navis customers such as AP Moeller Terminals, Dubai Ports World, Wal-Mart, Coca Cola Bottling, Johnson & Johnson, PepBoys and other leading supply chain companies, it became apparent that vast number of small and medium sized companies who co-exist or partner in the global supply chain with these major players were in need of a system that addressed their needs.  Out of this observation, SmartTurn was born with the mission of providing an inventory and warehouse management system that fit the requirements of the small to medium supply chain player, delivered it within a cost and risk profile which matches their world, yet still has the flexibility, functionality and power to address even large high volume facilities. Because SmartTurn's solutions require only a browser and an internet connection, our customers have been able to avoid the cost and hassle associated with the IT infrastructure, personnel, maintenance, and other hidden ownership costs of traditional installed software systems. While avoiding these hidden total cost of ownership (TCO) issues associated with traditional software, SmartTurn customers have found remarkable ways to corral their inventory views across their supply chain. Our customers also seamlessly integrate SmartTurn with existing applications such as QuickBooks, Peach Tree, Great Plains and other purchase order and sales order systems, creating an immediate leap in value to their customers. From the smallest warehouse or stockroom, to large warehousing and distribution operations, the flexibility of SmartTurn's system allows a customer to automate inventory operations to work efficiently, quickly and error-free. The resulting global inventory view and accurate warehouse practices can service all other areas of logistics that affect the health of their business.

From almost the very founding of Tyler and Smith County, there has been a local newspaper to keep residents advised of happenings of the day, community leaders and events shaping history. The company traces its roots to 1877 when two brothers, L. M. Green and J. P. Green, established the weekly Courier. The Courier was converted to a daily newspaper in 1882. A public stock subscription in 1906 helped pave the way for the consolidation of the Daily Courier and another local newspaper, the Weekly Times, creating The Tyler Courier-Times, Tyler's longtime afternoon newspaper. In 1910, a fire destroyed the production facility, forcing the newspaper to temporarily print in a job shop using paper not much larger than letterhead stationery.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment",,,101-250,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
