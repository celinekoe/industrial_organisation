According to Denny Miller, CEO of Take Charge, ""If every household in the state of Iowa used one of these smart power outlets, the potential energy savings would be over $60 million and the carbon footprint would be reduced accordingly. If everyone in the United States used a Take Charge PowerSaver, energy savings would translate to a total of over $6 billion dollars annually.""
