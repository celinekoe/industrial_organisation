Care Technology Systems announced the availability of CTS' monitoring suite on the 2net(TM) Platform operated by Qualcomm Life Inc. As organizations across the country are beginning to embrace the positive benefits of remote monitoring, many have been frustrated that they have to cobble together disparate solutions from different vendors. By bringing together PERS, ADL, and Biometric Monitoring all on one 2net Platform, Care Technology Systems is offering an unrivaled value proposition that is a win for plans, providers, and patients.  Based in Nashville, Tennessee, Care Technology Systems has united a range of leading-edge technologies and communications media to help seniors maintain their independence and lifestyle as they age in place. The key to the system is that it has no interface to frustrate the user. Its wireless technology works silently in the background to keep both families and staff informed 24/7 of the senior's lifestyle movements and requires nothing of the senior or patient to perform its role. If there are issues or threats, caregivers close by and far away are immediately notified through various communications channels -- including social media -- and can respond appropriately. A cloud-based system, Qualcomm Life's 2net Platform enables companies, providers, and users to capture data from any wireless medical device and deliver it to integrated portals or databases, storing it in a secure and reliable system. Information can be easily retrieved by physicians, caregivers, or other critical audiences, such as designated healthcare service companies, providers, payors, pharmaceutical companies, and application/device collaborators, for use in healthcare decisions. CTS utilizes the 2net Platform to provide PERS, ADL monitoring, and biometrics.","Health Care, Internet Services, Sales and Marketing",1,Jim Anderson,1-10,2,Early Stage Venture,980000,USD,980000,980000,USD,980000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

After taking a tour they bought a couple of pounds of shrimp and were blown away by the flavor and freshness and the decision was made to embark on the endeavor of ethically farming Pacific White Shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, within an indoor zero waste re-circulating bio-floc system. their children love shrimp. knowing what they now know about imported shrimp their family no longer eats them.
