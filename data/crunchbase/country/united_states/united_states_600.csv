He started acquiring Bonnes Mares, Chambertin and others and cellaring them (along with a few fine Ports) in a cramped and unwieldy cubby at a storage lot in the San Francisco Sunset. After marrying a French woman -- some 15 years ago -- he started taking annual trips to Burgundy and the Northern Rhône, to fill his French cellar and replenish his dwindling San Francisco stock with wines he loved.
