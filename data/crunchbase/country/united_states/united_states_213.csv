The customer’s experience is a quick and simple checkout with a personal touch. The user simply taps or scans their phone against the Koupah and automatically their loyalty card is punched, coupons are redeemed and receipt is emailed. The cashier is able to greet that customer by name, offer the customer their usual, and check on previous orders, all looping back to building better relationships.  Additionally, Koupah can completely eliminate credit card fees for the retailer. Since Koupah marries Social Media with Point of Sale we are able to allow brands, agencies and local businesses to reach their targeted and highly valued demographics by delivering personalized advertising on the customer’s receipt. The advertising fees we then receive are applied to subsidize or even eliminate the credit card processing fee from AMEX, Visa, MC or Discover, putting these funds back into the pocket of the retailer.","Advertising, Commerce and Shopping, Hardware, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Sales and Marketing",1,David Merel,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The goal of Audiolifeâ€™s D2F technology is to give artists an opportunity to generate streamlined revenue without incurring thousands of dollars in up-front costs. Audiolife has designed an e-commerce platform that is user-friendly and relevant to the changing dynamics of consumer behavior.

Thier mission is rooted in the philosophy that every athlete, regardless of age, body type or experience level, deserves to perform at their personal best. The SSL team of sports scientists, biomechanists and exercise scientists is led by a sports physiotherapist who is also an adjunct professor at Columbia University. The SSL team uses the most advanced technologies to assess all aspects of athletic performance, ranging from movement patterns of a single muscle to sport-specific movements and reaction times. Results from this analysis are then used to identify areas of imbalances or weaknesses and to develop individualized protocols to maximize athletic performance, ensure faster return to play following an injury and prevent future injuries. By uncovering critical, yet overlooked, areas of athletic performance, thier methods can transform a mid-level athlete to an extraordinary one. More importantly, thier approach helps athletes identify muscle imbalances before they develop into more serious overuse injuries and therefore has the potential to extend an athlete’s career and change the trajectory of athletic performance in the next decade and beyond. The technology at the Sports Science Lab is currently being used by leading hospitals, human performance labs, professional organizations such as the MLB, NFL, MLS, NBA, UFC, and the United States Olympic training center.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering, Sports",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
