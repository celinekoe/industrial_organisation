For industries that need constant cooling and temperature regulation, like refineries, commercial food refrigeration and data centers, not only are HVAC chilled water coils necessary for safe and efficient business operations, but also for remaining compliant with the newest state and federal energy guidelines. Preventing improper water flow The temperature level of incoming air is far over its requisite outtake into the building. However, this function is merely capable if the water running through the coils is doing so at an appropriate speed and is making contact with the inside walls of the coils. and since chilled water coils are designed with more rows than their quandary counterparts, surface contact is of even greater importance because forced air contains a longer route to travel before entering a building. If water isn’t properly chilling the coils, the whole process is wasting energy and money. Using HVAC coil coatings HVAC units housed in harsh environments, like those with high levels of salt and pollutants, have a far taller task in creating optimal HVAC conditions. Copper and aluminum coils may be especially tormented by these elements and start to corrode over time if necessary preventative measures aren't taken. Some of the primary signs of poor coil performance are small pinhole leaks and craters along the coil walls. When water and air are allowed to leak of the coils, the complete cooling capability of the system is in danger of degradation, and ultimately, malfunction. Additionally, small dimples that form within the coils decrease the surface contact potential of the chilled water, making the unit work harder to cool down forced air. If these problems still worsen, chilled water coils can actually break, and must get replaced immediately.",,,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The CEI process promises to be a critical factor in the growth of rechargeable batteries which is expected to be a $50 billion market by 2015.  Despite large R & D investment in the industry, the rate of performance improvement is relatively slow.  Dramatic improvements in cost, performance, or weight of rechargeable batteries will add high value to the end products where they are used. The CEI reproducible laboratory test results of its patent pending process, IPS™ (Interfacial Process Stimulation), demonstrate its claims for significant performance improvements in both Nickel Metal Hydride and Lithium Ion batteries.  The process will work with any type of rechargeable battery. The IPS™ process can be readily integrated into existing control systems, by adding a simple low cost logic component into the battery power management modules.  This means there is a minimal amount of incremental development and incremental bill-of-material cost. This is a disruptive technology which brings immediate performance results that match the more costly industry developments underway in battery chemistries and controls.  Through the implementation of software-driven advances in the operating system of the battery, IPS™ achieves clear improvements, but is also compatible and synergistic with these R & D efforts.   Key is that CEI’s process has been shown to be far more cost effective - it achieves the same results with a lower investment by at least four orders of magnitude.  CEI seeks partnership arrangements with market leaders where IPS™ will be a major driver to advances within important industry sectors such as mobile devices, electric vehicles and storage for renewable energy installations.  CEI has a passion for solutions that support the major global objectives for environmental health and security, energy independence, and economic growth.  CEI believes that IPS™ will have a major impact on these important objectives.","Consumer Electronics, Energy, Hardware, Manufacturing, Natural Resources, Sustainability",,,1-10,1,,,,,,USD,,MassChallenge,,1,,Private,,,,,,
