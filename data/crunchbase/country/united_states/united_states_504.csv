The Nigerian movie industry, Nollywood, is becoming increasingly popular. Time Warner recently offered Nollywood movies as a service, anticipating a target audience of up to 40 million North American customers. Last year, the industry of Nollywood generated $592 Million in revenue. African American and Afro Latino women love the movies. Nollywood also produces large amounts of content, up to 50 movies per month. Nollywood is an emerging market that will see an increase of followers in the United States in the upcoming years. The success of Netflix has shown a shift in the way they now watch programming. Today, many companies and cable networks attempt to duplicate the success of Netflix's video on demand service. There are other platforms specifically for Nollywood films. iRockoTV is considered a direct competitor. Unfortunately, iRockoTV is rather expensive ($7 per month to watch Nollywood movies). Their apps also have issues. And at times, their movies will stop playing. MiFi will be affordable, $3 for MiFi basic and $7 for MiFi. Also, specializing in user interface and user experience, as well as superior streaming and playback, MiFi will offer users a personal and enjoyable experience streaming through all the latest and retro Nollywood Films. MiFi's tech team will keep the apps and content updated to insure an enjoyable experience.  But perhaps the biggest draw for MiFi is its vision. After the initial launch, MiFi will begin to develop original content. MiFi will also introduce MiFi tours, which will take advantage of the growing popularity of African artists in America. Furthermore, MiFi will attempt to set up a partnership with Tyler Perry.  A partnership will allow MiFi to play Tyler Perry programming, as well as creating a service promoting aspiring African American directors. Today MiFi is just a concept. But with your generous contribution, MiFi will become the next big thing in video on demand.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Currently they are able to do US Passports in as little as 4 hours, and can do similar exceptional services with Visas for entry into foreign Countries.

For example: They can do Brazilian visas quicker and with less hassle than any of our competition. They do the same with Russian Visas and Chinese visas, etc. They also are one of the few Passport and Visa Expeditors which are Recognized and Registered with 4 Federal Agencies including the US State Department and Homeland Security. With these relationships we are able to expedite an unlimited number of US Passport all issued within 24 hours of when submitted. Other companies are limited to 15-20 per day.
