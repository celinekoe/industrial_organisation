I am a human rights activist, a policy advocate, a dreamer with hopes of freedom, democracy, and decentralization of power, and most importantly, a free-spirited artist. My camera was my brush, Syria is my canvas, and the revolution has become my art. When the Syrian revolution began over 10 years ago, I was one of hundreds of thousands of peaceful activists that took to the streets demanding that our government treat us with dignity and respect. My government responded with brute force to quell the peaceful protests. They used, and continue to use, every means at their disposal to destroy our minds, souls, and bodies. But, their brutality only gave us more reason to continue fighting. WHAT IS MY VISION? Syria must be free from dictatorship and all political detainees must be released. My hope is that this website can serve to educate and inspire others to share in this vision. Through my activism and art, I aspire to encourage others to tell their story and help create a collective for activists, artists, and innovators to push the digital boundaries of humanitarian advocacy.","Media and Entertainment, Sales and Marketing",1,Karam Alhamad,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The twiddish application compliments the online twiddish social network by providing users, aka dishers, with the real-time micro-blogging tools needed to share their dining experiences with fellow diners on a visual dish-by-dish basis. Each twiddish review contains a photograph of the dish, as taken by the disher as the food is served, along with a twiddish rating based on flavor, aroma, portion size, presentation, and value.  Dishers are encouraged to share any additional comments that might be helpful to fellow dishers in selecting a particular dish or restaurant by entering them into the optional comments field. â€œtwiddish is a paradigm shift from traditional reviews that focus on details such as dÃ©cor and ambiance while providing less information on what actually draws diners, the food.  twiddish cuts through this clutter and guides diners to make more informed dining decisions, whether dining out or ordering in for delivery, by providing them photographs and commentary that represent exactly what they can expect when ordering a dish at a given restaurant, â€ says twiddish co-founder Jonny Cottone. Dishers can search the twiddish social network by dish name, via either the mobile application or website, to discover those restaurants that have been recognized by fellow diners for either their exceptional or inferior preparation of the dish.  Dishers can also search twiddish by restaurant name to discover itsâ€™ signature dishes according to twiddish community members that have actually eaten at the restaurant.  â€œWhether in town or on the road, twiddish is a gastronomic guide that helps diners locate the very best of the dishes they crave nationwide,â€ says twiddish co-founder Michael Stewart. Dishers can sync their twiddish profile to other popular social networks, such as Twitter and Facebook, to tell their friends what they are eating and whether they recommend their peers to do the same.   The twiddish application is now available for free download from iTunes app store at www.twd.sh for iPhone and iPod Touch users.  Diners without a compatible mobile device can create a twiddish user profile and interact with the twiddish dining community via the twiddish website at www.twiddish.com.  The twiddish application and website were both developed by Fuzz Productions.  twiddish anticipates launching itsâ€™ blackberry application in the Spring of 2010. About StewartSoft StewartSoft LLC., co-founded by Michael Stewart and Jonny Cottone in 2009, is a digital innovation company focused on launching mobile and online endeavors that fuse emerging technology with lifestyle trends.
