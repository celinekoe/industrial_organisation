In the mid-1800s’, Homewood was a destination for the most affluent citizens of Pittsburgh, especially with the advent of the Pennsylvania Railroad; the railroad offered a chance for wealthy residents to escape city living. By 1910, Homewood housed 30,000 residents and was considered a choice location. It was not until a shift in the demographics in the 1950s that Homewood became more racially and economically integrated. During this time, the city claimed land in the Lower Hill District for the Civic Arena which displaced roughly 8,000 residents, many of whom decided to relocate to Homewood. Because the majority of these residents could not buy homes, rental apartments popped up to fill the need (Rebuilding Together Pittsburgh, 2010). The racial balance was now such that blacks outnumbered whites, leading to the phenomenon known as, “white flight,” where upper and middle-class white citizens left Homewood.","Community and Lifestyle, Real Estate",,,11-50,1,,,,,,USD,,Kresge Foundation,1,1,,Private,,,,,,

In the heart of their homeland, they laid the foundation for a tools manufacturing business that would withstand the test of time and transcend generations. In the early days, the two brothers toiled side by side, crafting quality tools that soon gained local acclaim for their durability and precision. As time passed, their dedication and commitment to excellence became a family tradition. The brothers' children, inspired by their fathers' success, eagerly embraced the legacy and expanded the business into new territories. Venturing into Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, the second generation of the Sandhu & Rajwal family solidified the brand as a global force in the tools manufacturing industry. Their relentless pursuit of innovation and customer satisfaction propelled the business to new heights. Now, the reins of this storied enterprise rest in the capable hands of the grandsons, Joe Sandhu and Pat Rajwal. Born and raised with the values of hard work and integrity, Joe and Pat are poised to lead Signature Tools into the North American market. Joe, with his entrepreneurial spirit and keen business acumen, has set his sights on the vast landscape of the United States. His goal is to establish Signature Tools as the go-to brand for professionals and enthusiasts alike, offering a comprehensive range of high-quality tools that meet the diverse needs of the American market. Meanwhile, Pat, driven by a commitment to excellence and customer satisfaction, is spearheading the expansion into Canada. With a focus on forging strong relationships and delivering top-notch products, Pat aims to make Signature Tools a household name in every workshop and construction site across the country. As the grandsons carry forward the family legacy, they remain rooted in the values instilled by their forefathers—craftsmanship, quality, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. Signature Tools is not just a business; it's a testament to the enduring power of family, tradition, and the unwavering commitment to providing the world with tools that stand the test of time. Join us on this journey, where the echoes of the past resonate in every tool we create, and the promise of a bright future drives us forward. In our continued commitment to innovation and education, Signature Tools has embraced a new frontier – Signature Tool Kits - by focusing on providing specialized tool kits to higher educational institutions and trade schools. Recognising the importance of hands-on learning and skill development, we have curated comprehensive tool kits tailored to the unique needs of these institutions. Our aim is to equip the next generation of craftsmen and professionals with the tools they need to excel in their chosen fields. By partnering with educational institutions, we not only contribute to the growth of aspiring tradespeople but also ensure that the legacy of quality craftsmanship endures through the hands of those who are just beginning their journey. This initiative reflects our dedication to fostering a culture of excellence in education and aligns with our vision of building a legacy that extends beyond the workshop to shape the future of skilled trades worldwide.","Manufacturing, Software",,,501-1000,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

After the memorial service, I suggested to my wife we splurge and buy a full stereo system. With her blessing, and a snug budget of $1,500, the shopping began. Little did I know I was going to step into a kind of hell on earth I didn’t know existed. So many speaker choices, dozens of them, and all displayed in an acoustically engineered showroom that didn’t begin to resemble my family room. Then there was the sales shpiel, droned by a commissioned salesman I was sure had just been lifted out of a car seat, and who flat lined every time I asked a tough question. But it was the markup that made me swallow my tongue. I used to build speakers in high school. I knew what the parts cost, and I knew if I paid the retail price, I would essentially be buying the distribution channel, not the speakers themselves. Then the light went on, not so much like a revelation, but more like a logical epiphany to a really screwy situation. I thought, “I’ll build the speakers myself. ”But the big epiphany, the kahuna of epiphanies, the one for which I am forever grateful, came a few weeks later, incited by a guy in Mexico I was talking to about the sonic capacity of Peruvian hardwood. He asked, “Are you going to make a business out of building speakers?” And while the prospect of doing so had never occurred to me, what leaped out of my mouth was “Yes.” With that ""yes,"" the vision to build remarkable sounding speakers at a remarkably low price was instantaneously born. Of course, it was a no-brainer that the prime way to do this was to sell direct to the customer online. Cut out the middleman, the distribution channel, all the bureaucracy that sucks a budget dry, then pour that cash into developing and manufacturing kick ass speakers. The boon to the customer? Extraordinary speakers at half the price of retail.  So, what started at a budget of $1,500 in 1998 turned into a million dollars in capital within months. And while my wife and I put off buying the speaker system of our dreams, within time we finally got it. It’s called the Aperion Audio Intimus 5.1 System. The best thing about this story? This is only the beginning.","Commerce and Shopping, Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Mobile",1,Win Jeanfreau,101-250,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Its strong commitment to collaborative inquiry and to the study of original texts makes St. John’s College a particularly vibrant community of learning. Through close engagement with the works of some of the world’s greatest writers and thinkers—from Homer, Plato, and Euclid to Nietzsche, Einstein, and Woolf—students at St. John’s College grapple with fundamental questions that confront us as human beings. As they participate in lively discussions and throw themselves into the activity of translating, writing, demonstrating, conducting experiments, and analyzing musical compositions, St. John’s students learn to speak articulately, read attentively, reason effectively, and think creatively. All classes at St. John’s College are small and students take active responsibility for their education, formulating questions and developing their thoughts in dialogue with one another. Faculty at St. John’s College share the college’s dedication to an education that privileges intellectual engagement over rigid expertise; they regard themselves as guides and mentors whose task is not to transmit information, but to pose questions that further students’ ability to develop as thinkers in their own right. Every student’s contribution receives serious consideration as classes delve into discussions of foundational works of philosophy, literature, history, theology, politics, economics, psychology, music, mathematics, and the laboratory sciences. By immersing themselves in these investigations, by examining their own ideas in conversation with faculty and fellow students, and by exploring their insights in their own written work, students acquire formidable skills and cultivate enduring habits of critical analysis and thinking. They learn to take themselves and others seriously as reasoning and feeling beings, to work together as collaborators and colleagues, and to lead fruitful lives of independent reflection and shared activity. In addition to the undergraduate program, St. John's students may earn master of arts degrees through the Graduate Institute.",Education,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Procter and Gamble has provided irrefutable evidence that this type of initiative can provide a global 6% lift in sales. Pablo Arellano (http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pablo-arellano-jr/4/161/663) and Colin Klayer (http://www.linkedin.com/in/klayerc) first met seven years ago while attending Northern Kentucky University; Pablo was studying Marketing and Colin was the first person to graduate from NKU’s Entrepreneurship program. They were co-presidents of NKU’s Collegiate Entrepreneurs’ Organization (CEO) Club, where they grew the organization to become one of the largest on campus and brought in speakers such as Terry Atwater (Warren Buffet’s apprentice) and Jack Cassidy (CEO, Cincinnati Bell). After graduation, Pablo focused on his position as the first NKU undergrad to become an Assistant Brand Manager at Procter and Gamble and then on launching several tech start-ups (WouldURather and YoDeal–sold to Reach Magazine–and most recently, American Beauty Association), while Colin joined a Cincinnati Startup called Zipscene where he worked as a Product Marketer, Product Manager and ultimately the Director of Operations. Last year, the pair began meeting on a weekly basis to brainstorm start-up ideas and out of hundreds of ideas, Earn and Play was born. They took the idea to NKU’s Start-Up Weekend where they were able to recruit several key players and have since brought on additional team members. Pablo is the innovator and idea generator. He provides guidance and direction for the rest of the team. Colin brings his experience developing new products, bringing ideas to life and scaling organizations to ensure success for Earn and Play.","Advertising, Commerce and Shopping, Gaming, Mobile, Platforms, Sales and Marketing, Software",2,"Colin Klayer, Pablo Arellano Jr.",1-10,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,Ark Challenge,,1,,Private,,,,,,
