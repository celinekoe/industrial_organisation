However, no two students are the same and therefore, one set of readings or videos simply cannot fit everyone. They also know that real learning happens when students can ask questions, engage with classmates and have a live teacher to learn from. Simply put - for valuable education to take place, personal interactions are required. They were determined to find a way to enhance all the great online courses out there with the benefits of face-to-face learning. That’s why they started Mentive. Mentive empowers knowledgeable individuals to guide small groups of students through online courses, as mentors. They offer classes in various time zones and languages, to ensure students enjoy the best online learning experience. When university students have questions, they go to teaching-assistant sections; when online students have questions, they come to Mentive.

Since 2017, we have been in the trenches utilizing our data-driven approach to reveal a new problem faced by veterans who have achieved financial stability and are wanting to take their life to the next level.  According to a Syrcuse study, 230,000 veterans are getting out of the military every year, and 43% will be leaving their first job within 12 months due to “not feeling challenged enough” or because of “underemployment.” That means over 98,000 veterans will be without work 12 months after their service has ended. In fact, most will go through at least 3 jobs until they “figure it out.” We call this the 43% those who don’t settle for just financial stability, but are seeking fulfillment, satisfaction, and a sense of purpose.  We realize that the interview prep, resume writing, and job fairs don’t provide the fulfillment, sense of purpose, and impact you are used to feeling while serving in the military. This is why we have made it our mission at The Ambitious VET Network to create that same camaraderie and strong bond of the military community, where you can connect, grow, and succeed alongside other like-minded high performing military veterans with relationships that will last a lifetime!  We also work with companies and the Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs) that are committed to the emotional intelligence, interpersonal skills, and self-awareness of the post 9/11 veteran population which is projected to be at 5.1 million by 2021.

The Feldspar mine is currently producing and is undergoing upgrades for expanded production. The operation is controlled in a Joint Venture with Paladino Management & Development Corp. The Anthracite Coal project Aim owns and/or controls through its wholly owned subsidiary, Aim Exploration SA. Furthermore, Aim is close to acquiring the rights to a Silica sand mine located in Kanab, UT.     Anthracite is the highest-ranking coal because it is older, harder, contains more carbon, has lower moisture content, and produces more energy than all other types of coal (World Coal Association). It is used industrially for metallurgy, coal gasification and liquefaction, power generation, water purification and filtration, and also for manufacturing of carbon composite materials. Anthracite is highly desirable, yet comprises less than 1% of global coal reserves. Its high carbon content of 82% to 86% makes it more cost-efficient than gas, oil or wood. Its low sulphur and volatile content makes it the cleanest-burning solid fossil fuel (Resource-Net).    Aim is currently working with a firm from India (Prina Energy) that has issued a Letter of Intent (LOI) to purchase 500,000 MT of our anthracite annually for a five-year period. Representatives from Prina Energy have viewed the mine site, and met with key players in our logistics program and officials at the Port of Salaverry. The agreement with Prina Energy is coming at a very advantageous time. The Indian government has ambitious plans to expand the manufacturing sector, where coal is the lowest-cost base load option. India will become the second-largest coal consumer in the world, bypassing the United States, and the largest import of thermal coal.","Administrative Services, Manufacturing, Natural Resources, Other",,,1-10,1,IPO,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Public,2014-10-24,,,AEXE,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/aim-exploration-ipo--36d47c7a,OTC Pink

Work-flow.biz is kind of like Web-based project management software.  Companies create an account, and each employee gets their own account.  Employees create tasks for each other when a task of work needs to be done.  Employees can also create projects, which are composed of multiple tasks.  Every task has a person it is assigned to, start date, end date, description, and status.  Everyone knows what needs to be done, who will do it, and its status.  This increases communication, captures knowledge, and saves â€œreinventing the wheel.â€  This also effortlessly creates metrics that managers, presidents, and owners can look at to do process improvement, budgeting, maximize human resources (a companyâ€™s biggest expense and biggest asset), and maximize profitability.  It creates a clear, detailed view of how business is going. It is a lightweight, clear, easy-to-use framework for carrying out work. It is abstracted away from any one business process, so all businesses can use it for all business processes! It is a seven billion dollar global market.","Administrative Services, Other, Software",1,Andrew Koper,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
