From integrating Maximo with your other business systems to extending Maximo’s functionality to highly specialized projects like consolidating Maximo systems or standardizing/normalizing Maximo data, nobody does it better or more cost-effectively than they do.  Even on straightforward implementations or upgrades, this technical capability makes a huge difference as it often also enables us to optimize and tailor Maximo for your business through advanced configuration techniques rather than  actual code customizations.They have developed many Maximo functional extensions and technical software tools, some of which are not publicly available and allow us to complete complex project tasks with reduced risk, cost, and time.Experienced in related technologies such as the various mobile Maximo platforms and reporting options such as Actuate, BIRT, Crystal Reports, and others.They have experience in all industries so it’s very likely they know your specific issues and regulatory compliance requirements.  From experience they also understand that 95% of the time good maintenance, inventory management, and procurement practices are relevant regardless of industry and they will draw from their cross-industry experience when making recommendations to you.They manage your project using a purpose-built Maximo project and task tracking web portal so they can easily collaborate with you and your team and you always know where your project stands.They don’t accept every project they’re offered.

EMC has developed relationships all over the world with every type of player in the investments business. We have represented over 100 companies from the standpoint of investor relations consulting. This experience is what you need to get your company in front of qualified partners.  The Emerging Markets Consulting philosophy is that investor relations is an ongoing project. We are relationship driven and results oriented. Our goal is to select the right clients and to concentrate our resources and efforts to serve a limited number of high quality clients. We provide ongoing reports reflecting measurable results. A full range of investor relations services are available. These include presentation development, corporate profiles, fact sheets, and press releases. Innovative and aggressive marketing programs are designed and implemented which utilize a multi media approach to communicate your company's history and business plan to the appropriate institutional and retail investment professionals. Our experience has proven that an initial media awareness campaign should continue for at least six months to achieve maximum results.  Most small cap and micro cap companies practice passive investor relations. They release news, develop websites and respond to inquiries from potential investors. We can handle these functions. They lack the relationships to be more proactive. Emerging Markets Consulting can effectively communicate your company's investment opportunities to the right people using the processes reflected below. With over 21,000 stocks in North America competing for investor dollars this is critical for your company to achieve the attention necessary to achieve adequate valuations. Our tools include the following:  Market Analysis  We can analyze the impact of various developments on the market, including assessing the impact on supply, demand, and price. These analyses can be taken one step further to assess the impact on the client's business.  Strategic Planning  We can provide recommendations of how a client can position itself to take advantage of upcoming market and business trends.

Our plan is to educate people,with a high school diploma, in Teethsavers one year school, in developing countries - that can then care for and educate their own people.  The vast numbers of children unable to receive any sort of oral health care in these countries is overwhelming. New techniques of providing oral health care and new methods of education of oral hygiene, have been developed by Teethsavers to facilitate these goals in the absence of normal dental equipment.  The tooth filling, advocated by the World Health Organization (WHO) Atraumatic Restorative Treatment (ART) was developed by Dr. Jo Frencken, MSc, DDS, PhD, the Netherlands during 14 years in Africa and was International Dentist of 1999.

Our organization is the only one teaching full-time ART procedures, no electricity needed and teaching oral hygiene at the children primary school, including mothers and school teacher workshop. We are the fourth category dental school that too many in the world do not know about – Yet.  Easy to move wooden apparatus is locally made and the uniqueness of the apparatus is its simplicity: the child lies on the wooden bench with hers/his head in the lap of the operator while the dental assistant using a wooden table and stool, passes instruments and material in modern four-handed dentistry in a virtually painless process at the patients school. No Tears, No Fears.  Mothers are taught to start daily oral hygiene at age three months (cloth around finger, carefully) and child looking at a picture book, if she cannot read, to develop the child's curiosity. One mother, more literate, teaches the other mothers and follows-up weekly.   Graduates, following the supervised six months field practical, can have a low fee private practice or work for their government. Tooth decay is the most prevalent childhood disease (bacterial infection) in the world. (WHO)","Education, Health Care",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

KBooM! recently launched the Mrs. Judd's Games brand specializing in iPad education games to teach fundamental skills to young children. Collaborating with former kindergarten teacher Frances Judd, the KBooM! development team designs games with elements and ideas children experience in everyday life to create an authentic learning experience in a digital world. Our newest app, Chalk Walk, is the first iPad app to feature pincer grip technology to develop children’s handwriting skills.  We also partner with consumer-facing companies to gamify their brands and create authentic interaction between the brand and its customers. Many in-game branded experiences either interrupt the game to shoehorn in a brand or product, or re-skin existing games with the client’s brand. KBooM!’s process begins with the partner’s marketing challenge and builds a fun interactive expertise that works within a brand’s overall integrated marketing campaign. KBooM! creates entertaining and user-friendly social, casual and mobile games with brands to engage and entertain their customers while deepening relationships. Instead of selling a product at the consumer, we seamlessly integrate brand-relevant images, themes, actions and rewards into the game, creating an opportunity for real-time feedback and rewards for the consumer.

What started as a small, personal project on Reddit’s Creative Server to build the entire Walt Disney World Magic Kingdom (with working rides) has now become a family of servers and members that span the globe. They have had over 100 cast members in their history, working to bring the entire park to life and smiles to their Guest’s faces. As of today, most of the parks & resorts are at a 1:1 ratio (Magic Kingdom is being rebuilt to the latest standards) and includes many extras, resorts, and even “hidden mickeys”. With experience working in the park, plus close proximity to Walt Disney World, their Cast has extensive knowledge of the inner workings, back stage areas, and guest favorites in ALL the parks. The attention to detail given to mcMagic ranges from specific food choices in restaurants to making sure every water fountain and trash can is in the right place. As Walt Disney said on Opening day: ”May Walt Disney World bring Joy and Inspiration and New Knowledge to all who come to this happy place … a Magic Kingdom where the young at heart of all ages can laugh and play and learn — together.”","Community and Lifestyle, Food and Beverage, Travel and Tourism",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
