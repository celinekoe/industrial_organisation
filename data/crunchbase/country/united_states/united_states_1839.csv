This is New York State's premier early-stage venture forum where the best companies from across the state present to the investment firms from New England to the Mid-Atlantic regions. Presented annually in the spring, companies are identified and vetted for participation in this event, and the resultant program features the state's best venture capital investment deal flow exposure across all market segments and technologies.

Now in its 13th year, SmartStart UNYTECH has to date highlighted 285 high-quality companies from throughout the state and beyond to the VC community, and their success speaks the quality of deal flow they select.  Of these companies, 64 have raised more than $500 M in equity financing, including more than $72 M directly attributable to their participation in the forum. In 2007, SmartStart was merged with UNYTECH, the Upstate University forum highlighting early-stage university spin-outs.  Additionally, this forum is marketed and recognized by many East Coast and Mid-Atlantic venture funds as the place to get Upstate NY technology deal flow.  They recognize each year some standout presentations with Best Business Presentation, Most Promising Technology and Most Likely to be Funded awards.   This unique event displays the very best early-stage companies from throughout the entire state of New York and beyond. Venture capital funds, seed investment funds and angel groups and investors can meet with and learn more about these company's teams, technologies and plans for succeeding in the marketplace.

We’ve been through training and licensing because it's a passion of ours. Let us use this passion to help you achieve your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning needs. We understand that moment when you walk into a nice, cool air conditioned room after a hot summer day. Or, conversely, when you can remove your layers because the heater is finally working, letting you be nice and cozy on a cold night. Perhaps everything is fine temperature wise, but you notice you are having health issues at home. Let us take a look at your ventilation. Your air ducts might be trapping and breeding mold spores, and we can clear those ducts out for you in a jiffy. If you are looking to build a home, office, industrial, or other type of building, let us know. We work with you and other contractors to ensure you get the best HVAC solution within your budget. As fully licensed contractors, we are very familiar with a whole range of projects and situations, and we can tailor our expertise to meet your needs. We are Irvine’s Best HVAC Experts for a reason. Give us a call today at (949) 835-4410.","Health Care, Real Estate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

This type of procedure first appeared a few years ago and over the years it has become quite a popular method for people struggling with excessive hair problems. This type of procedure uses a hand-held object that emits a laser that penetrates the subject's skin and is then absorbed by the hair present in that area of ​​skin. After absorption, thermal energy is generated, which descends into the axis and leads to the destruction of the root. It leads to hair removal safely and simply. An overview of such a process The laser transmitted by the device uses a beam of light that penetrates the skin and is then infused with a color pigment present in the strands, where the laser is finally converted to heat. The heat completes the strand removal process. The procedure is very safe. The laser is configured to adapt to the individual's curls and skin. There is a small risk of probable damage to the skin. Therefore, this method is extremely useful and safe. This particular process is known to produce great results. Various experts in this field call this process the best method to remove any type of hair on the body. The strands that grow after this process is complete are usually quite fine and easily processed. There is usually a slight tingling sensation when using this procedure, but it is not painful and certainly not like other similar methods available on the market. The best laser hair removal in NYC treatment Laser nurse offering laser hair removal NYC treatments must always have government support and a seal of approval. Again, a person seeking such a clinic should check which clinics have received assignments from the government and other health authorities. This is very important as these clinics are certified to provide excellent results. Therefore, the person should always choose the one that has the required seal from the health authority. This is very important as it requires a skill to fix the issues as well as the steps involved in the thread removal process. The qualification also means that the doctors and nurses can manage the process much more easily and efficiently.

AnsaOnline is proud to say that we are international online fashion retailers and we deliver products to number countries other than the United Kingdom. It’s not for a functional purpose; it’s more of a style statement. “Summer jackets give an empowered look to women. It’s a great addition to any wardrobe; it spells the arrival of androgynous fashion. “This trend stems from the fact that a lot of androgyny is coming into women’s wear. The blazer or the jacket is considered very masculine, but it has come back in its feminine avatar. It’s very girly and young,”Not surprising then, that fashion labels report a sudden spurt in the garment’s sales. “From belted styles to pretty prints, summer jackets are a huge hit this season. They contributed to 50% of our sales,” summer jackets are chic, classy and practical, and are thus in huge demand. Jackets have become an instant craze among fashionistas. It’s a new era in fashion — there are no rules.” We couldn’t agree more. The style scape is experiencing a wave of change and ‘everything goes’ is the mantra to swear by. Now is decidedly a good time to let go of all the fashion myths we have clung on to over the years. Because if your wardrobe is dictated by rules, you are bound yo miss out on allsartoiral fun. Here are some rules, you may have played by in the past, which are easy to skip.Worn in moderation, a sprinkle of sequins can uplift any look, no matter what time of the day it is.On the contrary, and this is a fit that is flattering on all body types. “Skinny pants are extremely versatile. The trick is to find the perfect fit,” say Ansaonline designers. Those on the heavier side should team them with a loose shirt or tunic. Feel free to send us your suggestions at www.ansaonline.com and any particular request on products that might have been sold out or that you would like to bring to our attention any items that we might have missed your feedback is valuable to us.","Clothing and Apparel, Commerce and Shopping, Design",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Our Mission is to end Identity Theft, as we know it, by giving consumers control. Turn Your Money ON/OFF In Seconds! With MyCreditVault, if thieves obtain your Social Security, bank account, credit or debit card numbers, unauthorized transactions will be denied approval. Finally, A Solution To End Identity Theft! Credit monitoring only tells you after theft may already occurred. Fraud alerts work better, but are temporary and can still allow fraud to slip thru. Credit freezes are effective but are difficult to set up and extremely inconvenient as they can take up to three days to turn on and off. MyCreditVault will work like a ""Real-Time Credit Freeze"" giving you 'lock & key' control over your credit files, credit/debit cards & bank account transactions. Important Questions About Your Credit 1. Is your good credit as valuable as your cash or is it more valuable? 2. If access to your cash requires a pin, why doesn't your credit? 3. What is stopping the protection of your credit as your cash? Identity Theft May Soon Be History (with your help)! An estimated 25 million Americans pay an average of $12.50 per month, for credit monitoring services. MyCreditVault believes many more would pay this monthly fee, for the peace in knowing their cash and credit accounts were more secure. Providing an improved service should increase adoption and even allow for increased fees. However, 100% of Americans could be covered for only $1/month at the same cost it now takes to pay for credit monitoring services for 25 million Americans. Albeit, for MyCreditVault to be fully embraced by banks, credit bureaus and credit monitoring service providers, the opportunity for increased revenues must exist. So how do we make MyCreditVault a reality? If those paying $12.50/month for credit monitoring services doubled to near 50 million Americans, or near 20% of all Americans, this would add about $3.75 billion in revenues. Javelin Research estimated fraud cost consumers and businesses $54 billion in 2009. CNN says that the healthcare industry alone is bilked of $100 billion/year, half being paid by Medicare with our tax dollars. In total, the estimated cost of ID theft to America is near $150 billion/year. If banks, credit bureaus and credit monitoring service providers were paid 50% of savings in the reduction of the financial losses due to Identity Theft and losses were reduced by 1/3, an additional $8.3 billion in revenues would be added. In total, new revenues for those protecting our financial accounts could rise $12 billion/year, thus replacing the estimated $6.6 billion/year in revenues banks lost from debit card processing, post-Durbin amendment, and add $5 billion, for those providing ID Theft prevention services. Plus America, would save about $33 billion/year and perhaps billions of hours a year! Even if this system cost $100 million to build, it makes the estimated $50 billion/year in healthcare and tax return fraud, paid for with our tax dollars, pale in comparison. If at all possible, tax dollars should not be used for development of this system. Banks and credit bureaus, the TRUSTED SERVICE PROVIDERS and GUARDIANS OF OUR CASH & CREDIT, should step up now to strongly support MyCreditVault! We need a credible and courageous media source to tell our story! WORKING TOGETHER, WE CAN END IDENTITY THEFT!",Privacy and Security,1,Randy Smith,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
