The company relaunched their product in January 2007 with enhanced sharing capabilities and a free 1GB version meant to entice users who are not ready to pay $55 per year for unlimited storage. The company found that the first version of its service didn't make it easy enough for its 11,000 paying members to share their hosted media with each other. Sharing usually had to be done by manually emailing password-protected links to family and friends. These emails would get lost, and with them, the URLs and passwords contained within. The new version of Phanfare addresses this issue by integrating social networking functionality that enables users to create connections with one another and specify which content they want to make available to their Phanfare contacts. The photo sharing capabilities are very similar to Facebook's, although users have more control on who sees which particular content. Phanfare also allows users to store photos and videos in a application on the desktop. It then syncs the media automatically with the web. Currently, this desktop client is only available for the PC but the company has been working on a version for the Mac as well.  Akin to [SmugMug](http://www.smugmug.com/), Phanfare converts the videos to Flash allowing them to be easily viewed online; users can also download them in their original form. There is also no Phanfare Facebook application or iPhoto plugin, but these too may be available in the future. A plethora of other competitors offer desktop photo storage and management applications. Some include: [Shutterfly](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/Shutterfly), [Snapfish](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/Snapfish), [Kodak](http://www.kodakgallery.com/Welcome.jsp), and [Picasa](http://picasa.google.com/).

Known as the Paradigm project, the project ran for some time within Apple, but management remained generally uninterested and the team struggled for resources. Eventually they approached Sculley with the idea of spinning off the group as a separate company, which occurred in May 1990. In 1990 Marc Porat, Andy Hertzfeld, and Bill Atkinson[5] in Mountain View, California founded it. Apple took a minority stake in the company, with John Sculley joining the General Magic board. Porat, Hertzfeld and Atkinson were soon joined at General Magic by Susan Kare, and most of Apple's System 7 team, including Bruce Leak, Darin Adler and Phil Goldman. During the early 1990s, Joanna Hoffman was vice president of marketing. In 1990, Porat wrote the following note to Sculley: ""A tiny computer, a phone, a very personal object... It must be beautiful. It must offer the kind of personal satisfaction that a fine piece of jewelry brings. It will have a perceived value even when it's not being used... Once you use it you won't be able to live without it."" The company achieved many technical breakthroughs, including software modems (eliminating the need for modem chips), small touchscreens and touchscreen controller ASICs, highly integrated systems-on-a-chip designs for its partners' devices, rich multimedia email, networked games, streaming television, and early versions of e-commerce. According to former General Magic employee Marco DeMiroz, it was the ""Fairchild [Semiconductor] of the 90s."" A documentary film about the company opened at the Tribeca Film Festival April 20, 2018. It was later shown at the SFFilm Festival in San Francisco on November 3, 2018. The company founders had hired filmmakers including Sarah Kerruish to document their development process in the 1990s, and Kerruish included some of that original footage of General Magic's offices in the film. The film includes interviews with Marc Porat, Andy Hertzfield, Joanna Hoffman, Megan Smith, and Tony Fadell.",,3,"Andy Hertzfeld, Bill Atkinson, Marc Porat",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
