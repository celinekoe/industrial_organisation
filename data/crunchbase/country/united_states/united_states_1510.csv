Jennifer decided on the company name “Custom Group Shirts” as it has the option to be CGShirts. CG is an abbreviation that could mean Color Guard. Jennifer started performing with the Lake Mary High School color guard and winter guard for 4 years after finishing her middle school career. After High School she performed with World Champions, Northeast Independent, for 6 years and the Boston Crusaders Drum and Bugle Corps for 3 years. From Greenwood Lakes Middle School to Tarpon Springs Middle & High School, Jennifer has taught several competition teams in the Orlando and Hillsborough/Pinellas County area of Florida. After being a public school teacher for 3 years, Jennifer went back to her true love of nerding out on the computer with her full time job of Media/Marketing Director for a fast paced Cosmetic Surgeon. From web updates, social media content/analysis and print publication creation, Jennifer at Custom Group Shirts has extensive history with Adobe Photoshop as well as creating basic websites for groups/teams. Being on staff and/or the director of teams, Jennifer was always around for the last minute “what do you want to put on our competition shirt this year?” We understand how much your students and parents love representing all the hard work and dedication your children/students have put forth. Being proud to wear and support a group is the same way Jennifer started designing. Jennifer began designing her own group shirts as well as other teams she worked with. Among the FFCC community in Florida, BOA community nationwide and WGI community nationwide, Custom Group Shirts are a big hit. Jennifer always had multiple parents from other teams ask “who printed your show shirts this year?” Even though our printers do an outstanding job, we hope that you can join us in correcting parents and spreading the word that Custom Group Shirts DESIGNED your show T-Shirts!","Clothing and Apparel, Community and Lifestyle, Design, Education",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

It's important to law firms because tracking their relationships with clients, attorneys, and other employees and ensuring that all interests are aligned at all times is required by legal Rules of Professional Conduct (RPCs). If interests are misaligned between a law firm and its client it is a violation of the RPCs and grounds for the client to sue the firm.

Bizzlle's price to conduct such an auction is just $29.95 to the Consumer and is free to Dealer participants; however only the winning Dealer pays a fee. When the Auction Period concludes, the Consumer may request disclosure of one Dealer and Vehicle Identification Number in exchange for placing a flat $300.00 Vehicle Hold Deposit. The winning Dealer holds the chosen vehicle for an additional 2 Business Days, allowing the Buyer time to visit the Dealership and execute a Buyer Purchase (or Lease) Agreement. The winning Dealers credits back the Buyer's entire Vehicle Hold Deposit to him / her at the point of delivery. Bizzlle retains the Consumer's $300.00 as its principal revenue stream, The software for this model is Patent Pending. Business to Business Model: Bizzlle provides Automobile Dealers a Web-based alternative to brick and mortar auctions, as well as, their online auction counterparts. Bizzlle uses the dealers existing, used inventory upload services to provide daily updates from dealer stock to its own server. This allows Bizzlle users to purchase and sell used vehicles to one-another in a matter of just a few clicks of the mouse. It also allows Bizzlle to better match wholesale buyers and sellers to one-another by analyzing dealer stocking weaknesses and providing notification when inventory becomes available within the Bizzlle marketplace.  We provide all inventory hosting, auctions themselves, as well as, analytical services free of charge to dealer enrollees.
