As shoppers shop, they discover a new product every moment, recreating the real-life experience of shopping what they have never seen before instead of just buying what they already know. For sellers, the process is simple: Take a picture of your item, give it a short description, set your secret price, list your item, schedule a live flash sale, prices fall live from the highest point, buyers compete to snap deals in 90 secs above your lowest price.  When an item is scheduled for a live flash sale, buyers tag and watch the item before it goes live. Buyers get notified when the flash sale begins. With only a very short 90 seconds, buyers never know when someone else will snatch your item from them, so they won’t want to wait too long. 90 seconds is all it takes to sell anything!  For buyers The longer you wait, the cheaper the item gets, but the greater the chance someone else will take it from you. What do you do?!
