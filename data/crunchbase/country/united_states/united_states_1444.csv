Ours is the noblest profession possible because we are providing people the ability to work. When you help people work, you are improving their lives and the lives of their families. You are contributing to society and enriching people in a unique manner.â€ -A. Harrison Barnes, Founder and CEO, Hound Hound is an online job-search engine that provides access to jobs directly from employer websites.  Unfettered by any commercial interest, Hound displays jobs in the order of priorityâ€”not in the order of who is paying to post on the site. History Hound is the brainchild of A. Harrison Barnes, founder and CEO of EmploymentScape (previously Juriscape). The company has been offering career services to thousands of professionals for almost a decade now.  The primary ventures of the company have been legal industry-related career sites including LawCrossing, Legal Authority, BCG Search, Attorney Resume, etc.  In 2006, EmploymentScape CEO A. Harrison Barnes decided to use the experience and expertise gained from running multiple employment sites for attorneys to a broader field and formed Hound. Working Every single job on Hound comes through an innovative search technology that was over two years in the making. The technology tracks down jobs directly from employer websites, classifies them, and puts them on the site.  Hound competitors do not use this technology and instead ask employers, recruiters, and others to send them their jobs (through RSS feeds). Hound goes out and pro-actively pulls jobs directly from employer websites. Growth Hound is experiencing significant traffic growth due to its strong marketing strategy and unique organizational structure.  The overall traffic has increased more than 100% since December, 2007.  The Hound USP of listing jobs directly from employer career pages was conceptualized by Harrison Barnes and has contributed greatly to the company success.  Also, Hound has a staff of more than 500 dedicated professionals who manually research for more and more employer websites to add to its search engine. Utility Hound jobs typically receive hardly any applications.  Since these jobs are not advertised on other job boards, employers are much more receptive to applications when they have not received many inquiries.  For a recruiter, this also means that the calls thus made to employers are typically met with much more enthusiasm than they otherwise would have had, if the job was widely publicized. Additionally, a seven-day free trial allows job seekers and recruiters to try out the site without any hassle of paying.",Internet Services,,,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Refining its business strategy in 1962, the company changed its name to MC Sporting Goods and focused entirely on quality sports equipment, footwear, and apparel.  Since that time, MC Sports has taken its retail concept to markets throughout the Midwest. In 1987, MC Sports accelerated its expansion through the acquisition of Morrie Mages’ Sports, a three-store chain located in the Chicago area. A year later, Browns Sporting Goods was acquired adding 19 stores to its portfolio.  By the end of 2012, MC Sports will operate 74 stores in seven states throughout the Midwest. Future growth is continually being mapped out with a strong emphasis on locations throughout the Midwest.  Every MC Sports store gives back to their community through team sponsorships, fund raising programs, team and group discounts, and a long-standing commitment to the Children’s Miracle Network.  As one of the few remaining privately held sporting goods chains, MC Sports is truly a unique retailer. Built on a foundation of Service, Family, Convenience, Community, and Integrity, you can be sure that MC Sports will continue to offer quality, top-name sports gear at competitive prices.","Clothing and Apparel, Commerce and Shopping, Sports",1,Jack Finklestein,1001-5000,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The technology license agreement was formalized in FY2011. Dr. Christman’s work has developed promising results for the treatment and repair of cardiac tissue damage. A departure from current approaches, this innovation is a hydrogel that treats damaged tissue by providing a restorative scaffold on which new cells can grow. This hydrogel, VentriGel, is made from cardiac connective tissue that is stripped of heart muscle cells through a cleansing process, freeze-dried and milled into powder form, and then liquefied into a fluid that can be easily injected into the heart. Upon reaching body temperature, the liquid turns into a semi-solid, porous gel that encourages cells to repopulate areas of damaged cardiac tissue and to preserve heart function. The hydrogel forms a scaffold to repair the tissue and possibly provides biochemical signals that prevent further deterioration in the surrounding tissues.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",3,"Adam Kinsey, Adam Kinsey, Karen Christman",11-50,2,,,,,5310118,USD,5310118,,,,,Private,,,,,,

As early as 2008, the UK was considering a ban on patio heaters, with an estimated economic impact in the UK alone of up to 250M euros in lost revenue per year to the pubs, restaurants, and caterers that depend on them. Armita-X is disrupting the entire outdoor space heating industry by making use of our most current understanding of thermodynamics and modern computing to more efficiently generate heat- saving gas, money, and the environment. Our patented technology will be the first to bridge the gap between outdated mechanical devices and modern, intelligent, energy-conscience devices. Armita-X is a marvel in thermodynamic efficiency: Capturing waste in the form excess heat, the unit is able to generate its own electricity. Equipped with wireless networking, even multiple units are easy to control from the palm of your hand. Both the smartphone application and the touchscreen panel on the device provide information regarding the level of propane gas remaining, the duration until the propane gas cylinders need to be exchanged, battery levels, and temperature control options. In addition, the unit is smart enough to automatically power down when a leakage is detected. Ultimately, we envision Armita-X as a modular platform rather than a simple device. Based on needs addressed by customer discovery, we’ve already added the option to add lights, a touchscreen, and speakers, amongst others. Each Armita-X can be customized to match the particular needs of the end-user. A sleek aluminum casing encloses heating elements that better utilize propane gas, generating longer heating periods per unit of gas, and making use of the entire tank. Efficient design incorporates three different heat sources: while the first element helps generate heat quickly, the third element helps retain heat, striking a balance that allows for fast start-up and longer sustained heating periods.  Using proximity sensors, Armita-X knows when to turn on and off, minimizing waste. Pressure sensors remove the guess-work of how much gas is left in the tanks, meaning you’ll no longer effectively throw your money away when disposing of tanks that still have leftover gas. our target market are residential( backyards) and commercial (restaurants,hotels, cafe's, bar's ,outdoor events and parties and etc).","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Consumer Electronics, Data and Analytics, Energy, Food and Beverage, Hardware, Science and Engineering, Sports, Sustainability, Travel and Tourism",1,Mehdi Doorandish,1-10,1,,,,,,USD,,Cleantech Open,1,1,,Private,,,,,,

According to the Financial Stability Board (FSB),  the size of the Global Shadow Banking industry boasts an excess of $72 trillion, while the United States alone is of $25 trillion in value. What is Shadow Banking / Alternative Finance? Shadow Banking is the activity of Non-Bank institutions emerged post financial crisis by creatively harnessing the technology and disrupting the traditional financial sector. Some of the key segments in Shadow Banking Sector include: Peer2peer lending, Consumer lending, Commodity trade finance, Small business lending, Leveraged lending, Mortgage backed lending, Educational loans, Commercial real estate, Digital wealth management, Alternative crypto currencies (Bit coin), Private equity/hedge funds. The need for low-risk (secure), short-term lending between giant financial institutions gave rise to what is called the shadow banking system, also known as the parallel banking system. The pillar of the shadow banking system is the “Repo”. In the shadow banking system (aka securitized banking), banks both sell loans and retain loans. Banks also move their assets off the books to what are variously called off-balance sheet vehicles, special instrument vehicles (SIVs) special purpose vehicles (SPV), or special purpose entities (SPE). The private Shadow Banking System - SBS is (slowly) filling the funding gap between lender and borrower needs at this particular yield and risk range. These are exciting and positive developments for the U.S. capital markets generally and for the prospects for U.S. SMEs. It is these, small, private, well-structured financings (away from the exotic CDOs or “too big to fail” nonbanks) that may be the real heart of the recovery in the US financial system. Shadow Banking: The Big Winner of the Financial Crisis An eye-popping new study by researchers at Stanford, Columbia, and the University of Chicago finds that nonbank “shadow” lenders write 38% of all home loans — almost triple their share in 2007 — as well as originating a staggering 75% of all loans to low-income borrowers insured by the Federal Housing Administration. The Shadow Banking Sector & Alternative Financing Driven by Technology The pillar of the shadow banking system is the “Repo Market”. The “shadow banking sector” refers to the activities of non-banks that raise short-term funds in the money markets and use those funds to buy assets with longer-term maturities. A new generation of “shadow” actors emerged (or in some cases, re-emerged) out of the financial crisis and, by creatively harnessing technology and other trends, is working to disrupt the traditional financial sector. The term “shadow bank” was coined in 2007 by Paul McCulley of PIMCO, a big bond fund, to describe risky off-balance-sheet vehicles hatched by banks to sell loans repackaged as bonds. Today, the term is used more loosely to cover all financial intermediaries that perform bank-like activity but are not regulated as one. These include mobile payment systems, pawnshops, peer-to-peer lending websites, hedge funds, and bond-trading platforms set up by technology firms. Among the biggest are asset management companies. In 2013 investment funds that make such loans raised a whopping $97 billion worldwide. Shadow banking is a market-funded, credit intermediation system involving maturity and/or liquidity transformation through securitization and secured-funding mechanisms. It exists at least partly outside of the traditional banking system and does not have government guarantees in the form of insurance or access to the central bank.",Financial Services,1,Venkat S Meenavalli,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,2,Private,,,,,,
