Sending goods internationally can be extremely costly from a time and money perspective because of inefficiencies with logistics companies. vakargo aims to leverage the existing human network of world travelers to get items delivered in a timely manner and for a reasonable price. The idea originated from the founders’ personal experiences when trying to ship items from the United States to friends and family in Vietnam. Frequently, packages are transferred from company to company until it reaches its destination, resulting in items being late, damaged, or missing. Christmas packages delivered to missionaries in India were not received until February, and were ultimately found to be empty boxes. Electronics sent to family in Vietnam were never  received. A drafting pen from Tokyo took 8 weeks to arrive in Oklahoma. Asside from process inefficiencies, there are also cost inefficiencies. Shipping small items to Vietnam can be up to $200, while delivering a television only 250 miles from Dallas, TX to Norman, OK can be more than $100. Because of these issues, people have resorted to utilizing their social network and “hiring” friends who travel to deliver items, but the opportunities are infrequent on a small scale. vakargo can create connections between people who need items shipped with people who travel in order to make the delivery process efficient, reliable, and of fair value. Peer-to-peer businesses have proven to be successful across many industries, and vakargo looks to leverage the concept of social sharing in order to provide a much-needed alternative for people around the world. Though vakargo does not create “extra space” in a suitcase, it provides the network to access it. Travelers can provide their itinerary details and amount of extra space they have in their luggage. Users needing to ship items can search through listings based on the shipping destination and time frame to select a traveler and negotiate terms. Using the existing infrastructure from airlines, vakargo users can send items internationally overnight and at a fair price! And most importantly, both users can benefit from little effort. vakargo has conducted an initial pilot studies and launch events to test its hypothesis and growing user base.","Transportation, Travel and Tourism",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
