For example, if a news website posts a story about dog adoption in your city, LilyDrive gives publishers a way to embed a small widget — similar to social media buttons — that lets readers donate money to a relevant organization and share the story and their contribution with friends. LilyDrive CEO Harrison Magun said that the fresh funding will help the startup build upon some early traction with publishers and users. The company recently launched with its first medium-sized online publisher, Good News Network. The money will also help LilyDrive figure out how to make its own revenue — the company does not take a cut of any donation made via its platform. “When people donate to a cause, they don’t want part of their good deed to be someone else’s business model,” Magun explained. Magun said the monetization strategy is to “be a native ad platform for enterprise cause marketing.” He noted that despite Fortune 500 companies donating to charity more than ever, customers still expect them to contribute more time and money. “At LilyDrive we think the problem isn’t that companies necessarily need to spend more on charitable causes — in fact, companies have never given greater amounts,” Magun said. “The problem is that, despite clear consumer demand, it’s really hard and expensive for companies to advertise their good work in a way that engages with customers and is cost effective.”",Advertising,1,Harrison Magun,1-10,1,Seed,450000,USD,450000,450000,USD,450000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Part of our transformation was eliminating the word “Patient” from our vocabulary and replace it with “Client”.  This small move inspired our entire team to think about our customers from a different perspective.  Healthcare is a service industry like any other.  Your time is as valuable as ours.  We have changed the way we think as healthcare providers to focus on service first.  Excellent medical advice and treatment is expected from the physicians, but the team must live up to the same level of care, and that is where Healthcare as a service must improve.   We as a service industry can no longer expect Patients to have Patience as they wait for hours in an uncomfortable waiting room. The unique approach of client centric, digitally integrated, efficient healthcare may be hard to believe, and much like the Platypus some may even consider it a hoax.  “The unusual appearance of this egg-laying, duck-billed, beaver-tailed, otter-footed mammal baffled European naturalists when they first encountered it, with some considering it an elaborate hoax.”  But, just like the Platypus, Source Healthcare is very real and changing the approach to Healthcare. As Healthcare systems consolidate into large inefficient entities that lack the agility to adapt to the changing landscape, Source Healthcare is in a constant state of evolution  adapting to market demands.  Many other healthcare groups are choosing to join in with large organized health systems thinking that critical mass is their solution to survival.  Source Healthcare has chosen to stand alone and evolve at a faster pace in the new environment of healthcare. According to Australian folk lore, the land animals, water animals and birds, all competed for the platypus to join their respective groups, but the platypus ultimately decided to not join any of them, feeling that he did not need to be part of a group to be special.",Health Care,1,Tim Davis,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
