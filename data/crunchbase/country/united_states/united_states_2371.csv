But the convenience offered by predefined digital CMOS standard cells has come at the price of overall chip-level efficiency. Standard-cell-based ICs are rarely optimized for their intended application, so ICs are not as small, fast or power-efficient as they could be. Nangate cell library creation and optimization tools provide the answer to this dilemma. Nangate tools enable custom tailoring of digital cell libraries to meet specific design targets. Libraries can be optimized for design goals such as power consumption, die area, operating frequency or required yield â€“ as opposed to being designed for a broad range of standard requirements. The result: improvements in IC performance can be achieved at much lower cost and with considerably less effort than using full-custom design methods.","Consumer Electronics, Design, Hardware, Science and Engineering, Software",3,"Jens C.

In 2018 the company expanded by moving its headquarters to the United States. AudienceRun is connected to the biggest international SSP platforms which allows it to serve publishers from all over the world. The company operates at an international level and is continually working on innovative ways to address the demand of both publishers and advertisers. Through the years, the AudienceRun experts have come to the conclusion that keeping web visitors engaged is crucial for the website’s monetization. This requires agility in ad formats but also understanding the needs of a constantly evolving environment. AudienceRun offers standard IAB formats. Those are the most commonly-used sizes and include: 728x90 - leaderboard/ 300x600 - half page ad/ 970x250 - billboard/  320x50 - mobile leaderboard. As these are the most common types of ads, inserting them on a website is an effective way to maximize display ad earnings. Most publishers adapt their website designs so that they could include these ad units and therefore not to miss an opportunity.  AudienceRun has developed UpNext format, a technology inspired by the Youtube ""Up Next"" model where videos are displayed next to or below the video a user is watching. They are automatically selected based on several factors, including what is currently being watched. AudienceRun UpNext format is an answer to the way people consume information online. It is a discrete cross device solution that respects the website’s interface and gives the right user experience. The format appears at the bottom right corner of the page when the user has read a certain amount of lines and wishes to continue navigating through rest of the website. Fixed Header and Fixed Footer are cross device ad formats that are placed, one at the top of the webpage and the other one at the bottom. They are always visible to users during their navigation. The advantage is that they do not interfere with reading experience and help publishers significantly increase their digital advertising revenue as the user do not feel the need to close them. 	 Interstitial Mobile ad is a full-screen ad format using creative mechanisms that targets the constantly increasing mobile audience. These type of ads have a high engagement rate as users cannot simply ignore the ad. They have to make a choice between the ad and continuing to the website.","Advertising, Content and Publishing, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Sales and Marketing",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
