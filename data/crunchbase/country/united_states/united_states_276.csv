The company's primary function of interest is to offer extended warranty contracts from our roster of A-rated service contract providers. Clients can either pay in full at the time of the contact or they can finance their payments over a term of one to three years. Its marketing strategy will be to initiate a new technology that has proven to be very successful in the auto warranty arena called agent-assisted automation. This patented technology is specifically designed to mask foreign agents so they can prospect for sales leads without any productivity loss. It is no secret that prospects do not like to hear sales pitches delivered by a foreigner. When lead generation is performed with an international accent, there is an 80% conversion loss that negates the benefit of using cheap offshore labor.
