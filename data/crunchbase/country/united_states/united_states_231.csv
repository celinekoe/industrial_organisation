SpamHero's was developed by two brothers, Curtis and Jeremy O'Reilly.  After 13 years in the web hosting industry they've witnessed first hand the frustrations that business owners have over the cost of fighting spam, and the lackluster performance of existing solutions. What makes SpamHero different is that it is powered by a team of human spam-fighting technicians who are updating the filter rules several times a day.  Over 2 million rules have been compiled so far.   Unlike ""robotic"" algorithms that can sometimes mistake real email for spam, each rule is carefully crafted in such a way that  real email does not get blocked. Because SpamHero is a hosted solution, it requires no new hardware or software installed at a clientâ€:tm:s location.   The client changes what is known as their domain's MX record so that email flows through SpamHero's filtering servers before it reaches the domain's real mail server.   The filtering service all includes a Web 2.0 email quarantine that allows users to view the spam that is caught by the filter. Pricing for the service starts at $4.95 per month for domain-wide filtering, which the company founders believe is much less than similar solutions on the market.",Internet Services,2,"Curtis O'Reilly, Jeremy O'Reilly",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
