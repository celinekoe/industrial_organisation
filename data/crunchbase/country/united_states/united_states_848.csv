The signature Clock Tower Administration Building and Assembly Shops and the grand four story Hotel Florence give tangible evidence to the national and international influences of Pullman -- on transportation, industrial design, architecture, labor, urban and town planning and landscape design -- in the contemporary context of America's post-industrial economy, where much of the evidence of the industrial age has already disappeared. The historic factory and hotel buildings long ago outlived their original purposes, casualties of emerging technologies, evolving building standards, shifting consumer demands, large economic shifts from an industrial economy toward a service based economy, ending in divestiture and passing into obsolescence. When the State of Illinois purchased the site in 1991, to memorialize an economic, political, and social giant of the industrial age, few then could imagine the future exodus of industry from their shores and the fundamental societal changes that would be felt around the globe. Today, the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, a state agency, is administering the site's transformation during a multi-phased stabilization and restoration effort.

You can also select from a list of specials at the bar or you can enter a SpeedMenu code that orders items off the regular menu. The ticket is printed at the bar station and the bartender starts preparing your drink within a couple seconds of placing your order.  Want to close your tab? Simply click the close my tab button and your tab is printed out and ready for the staff to bring you your tab to close out. You can pay with cash or credit card as usual and unlike other systems that try to replace the staff, you get a friendly ""thank you"" as you close out from a real human being.

We started this company from scratch. My mother (Rita Bitencourt) originally worked in politics at the City Hall in Itajuba, Minas Gerais, Brazil and on her leisure time, she would create and sew bags and purses for herself to take to work. As time progressed, people at her work started to notice her crafting skills and ask if it was possible to make this or that bag so they could also use them at work. Me, Elisa Bitencourt, a geek and gamer by nature, addicted to anime and mangas, always loved to draw (I would do them during classes on the school desks and chairs), so one day I came up with the idea that I also wanted to learn how to sew. And that is how EVERYTHING started! Then I met my husband, Robert Evans (I met him in an online game - just as an extra information) while he was living in London working as a Commodity Broker (he went to CISI - The Chartered Institute for Securities & Investment). Some months after. he flew to Brazil and, while living together there, he got involved in the company. Time went one and we decided to move back to his home country, USA, then the idea of creating a Rbitencourt USA came up. He got us our international trademarks and patents, and the rest is all you can see!","Commerce and Shopping, Consumer Goods, Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio, Real Estate",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
