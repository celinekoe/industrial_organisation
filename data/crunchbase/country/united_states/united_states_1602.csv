Office Genie (known at the time as Desk Space Genie) launched on 2 March 2009 as the UK's first* national website for finding and advertising spare desk space in offices (* well, we think it was the first, we couldn't find any others). The site quickly made a massive impact and then grew in September 2010 to allow people to compare serviced and conventional offices in addition to shared offices. The site is designed to create as simple and hassle-free user experience as possible, both for searchers and advertisers. Searchers can carry out a simply postcode search, check out local schemes, and enquire by completing a simple form. Advertisers can create adverts in just a few moments free-of-charge, and can then manage adverts and campaigns on an ongoing basis.","Commerce and Shopping, Other, Real Estate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Hollywood’s archaic bottlenecked procedures produce and distribute less than one percent of the more than 50,000 movie scripts that are submitted every year. Expand this to the global film market and the potential possibilities for Block-Buster film content is almost endless. We, at Scriptank, plan to open up the possibilities. Scriptank empowers the movie audience to choose their favorite scripts from this massive resource and then critique, like, and vote on the ones they want to see made into movies instead of the Hollywood bean-counters. This means a greater number of “trending” Block-Buster films, chosen by the audience,  will be made and distributed worldwide every year.   Scriptank facilitates these audience-selected scripts through the funding, development, production, and distribution stages.   Scriptank has more than 20 revenue streams built in for profitability.

Scriptank's movie product placement is a unique and proprietary algorithm process that matches your brands category with your audience target market and ""trending"" movie script scenes. ​ In addition, Scriptank has developed a unique interaction between our members (Millennials and Baby-Boomers of all income ranges) and our brand partners where our members treat brands and advertisers as part of the ""Production Team"" and patronize their ads, promos, and links,  since brand and advertising funds are a part of what helps to get the audiences movies made. ​ Scriptank has another unique brand opportunity that allows brands to give partial advertising funds in product or services and these are then utilized as member incentives when they reach specific goal points.

The site, which began development in the Spring of 2011 and launched in the Summer of 2012, allows investors to begin the process of finding a financial advisor in a more specific manner.  This is done by having investors define the characteristics they desire in an advisor while also giving advisors the ability to define the types of niche clients they desire.  The site is open to all investors and financial advisors.  The goal of InvestorClarity is to give investors more efficient search results than the typical directory while allowing financial advisors to differentiate themselves among their competition. InvestorClarity is a completely free service to both investors and financial advisors.  To stress the importance of being unbiased, the site does not allow financial advisors to pay any fees to the site in return for preferential search result placement.  In addition, advertising dollars are not accepted from any firm that employs financial advisors. In October 2012, the company decided to further extend the business model into other regulated, relationship-based industries with the launch of ParentClarity.org.

Unfortunately, the world didn't seem to be ready for motion based control. No one seemed to think anyone would get off the couch to play a video game. They felt this was odd considering that their first implementation allowed you to control a light saber – in their view, the holy Grail of all gaming. So off into storage the controllers went (truthfully, they went home with a few of the hard-core gamers for thousands of hours of unofficial testing). In the meantime, they focused on advanced motion capture technology in sports (iClub.net). Then a year ago or so, something called the Wii took off and all of a sudden it seems like the world was ready for what they have to offer. So here they are, seven years later (…talk about being way ahead of a technology curve) and they're bringing out a next generation controller for everyone to enjoy.
