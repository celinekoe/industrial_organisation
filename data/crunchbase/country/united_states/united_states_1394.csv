Chosen is a company based around two principles: commitment to our customers and cutting-edge technology. We aim to create a solution that not only works within your budget, but that follows new trends and technologies, offering the prefect balance of creativity and functionality. You can spend a lot of money working with a large corporation employed by a generation that was raised on old standards, design, and development principles and feel comfortable because they've been in business longer, or they have a large office, or a lot of fake awards. You can spend a very small amount of money and get your website built by a company based out of the country or by your nephew who is in college and knows how to build you a myspace page. This may make you feel like you are getting a great deal because it is so cheap, but you get what you pay for! Chosen is far from either of these principles. We were the guys making websites for our family and friends in collegewhile also working for ""the man"" and big corporations. We realized that neither were of the caliber that we wanted, so we went out to change the web. We are young, and we are bold, but we are also very good. We could program in our sleep (not joking, we often dream in code.. it's scary) and we don't produce work that we will not be proud of. If you work with us, we are not going to just be your designers or developers. We are going to be your friends that you can call night or day and ask for favors. We are the friend that will make suggestions and be honest and forward with you. We will be the friend that you can trust, chat with, and get advice from. So if you are looking for just a plain website, call the other guys, we don't mind.. honestly.
