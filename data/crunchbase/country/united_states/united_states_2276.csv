Our mission is to advance meaningful, high quality, and socially-driven medical research. More quality research funded will lead to improved health, effective treatments, and reduction of disease and illness. We have three core values: ​Transparency, Empowerment, and Connection. Transparency - You should know where your money is going when you support medical research. With us, you can learn about the research you are supporting. Because your money goes towards a grant based on reaching milestones, you can have confidence that your contribution will be used for the research you sponsored. You will also have the opportunity to receive regular updates as the study progresses.  Empowerment -  Why do the government, companies, and large organizations get to choose the research that should be funded, but we can't? Research sponsorship shouldn't be limited to millionaires and pharmaceutical companies. Research Lead empowers the average person to make a difference and fund meaningful medical research that matters to them. Meanwhile, researchers are empowered to conduct the research they believe will save lives and make us healthier. Connection- We aim to connect you with researchers and learn their stories and motivations. By connecting researchers and sponsors, we aim to increase awareness of research and improve how research gets communicated. Together, we can create a community dedicated to research that will make a difference for all of us. Researchers submit their studies to Research Lead to be reviewed by our experts. We review the studies to ensure that they meet Research Lead standards:    - Only qualified researchers. The researcher must have credentials and be affiliated with a reputable non-profit institution.     - Only well-designed, socially-driven medical research. Research must be not for profit without conflicts of interest. Research is supported by current scientific understanding and aimed at improving health in humans.  ​​       We do NOT choose which topics of medical research are worthwhile. That is left up to you, our sponsors. Once a study is approved to be on the platform, the Research Lead supports the researcher and their team in preparing their profile. This includes helping convey clarity and understanding, selecting representative images and videos, and drafting of budget and grant. As soon as a study reaches its funding goal, sponsorship is closed. We will let you know when your study has been fully funded! Research Lead then works with the researchers, their institution, and lawyers to finalize the grant for funding the study. Once the grant is finalized, the research will begin receiving grant payments as the study reaches milestones outlined in the profile (timeline section). You have the option to receive email updates, so you can be alerted as your sponsored research progresses! Once the study is complete, researchers will share their findings with you through the platform.","Biotechnology, Financial Services, Health Care, Science and Engineering",2,"Dr. Jessica Hunter, Jenny Hunter",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Based on a perception gained from a lifetime career working with several of the most respected general contractors and developers in the region, we saw our company’s mission to be far more than just another commercial contractor bid source with the common promise of “on time and on budget.” To carry out our mission, each commercial building construction project requires us to assemble a team of experienced professionals with a single goal: ​ TO FULLY EXAMINE EACH OF THE CRITICAL ISSUES NECESSARY TO PLAN AND EXECUTE A SUCCESSFUL PROJECT ​ By leading this team of construction professionals, Brady Commercial Construction Services, Inc. takes the responsibility and accountability with a single contact point for the owner to rely on. The emphasis on this planning stage has proven over time to identify project savings and prevent costly overruns during the actual building construction phase. This project team is made up of some of the most respected and experienced architects and engineers in the area. Our team is selected according to their experience with specific project work, such as industrial, commercial, or institutional construction design and engineering. Adding to this is our own highly experienced staff of project managers, site superintendents, and contract administration personnel. We offer the “right stuff” needed for a project to come in “on time and on budget”. We sincerely welcome the opportunity to discuss your project and let you decide if BCCS is the right choice for your building construction project needs. Our top priority from beginning to completion is you — the client. Our goal is to make sure you are satisfied with the outcome of our work. We provide you with overall construction solutions to help you build your vision with project services that exceed your expectations.","Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Real Estate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

After several underwhelming attempts to build his fledging business traditionally, the 25 year-old entrepreneur decided to radically change gears and go after his target consumers directly. He accomplished this difficult undertaking by diligently studying relevant profiles of the top 10,000 websites on the ranking site, Alexa and sending the best matches a sample bean bag. This quasi-guerilla marketing tactic worked so well, that by the end of 2006, the company enjoyed an impressive 800% profit growth. In the ensuing years, Sumo Lounge quickly expanded to the UK, the U.S, Australia and New Zealand and currently owns 14 factories in seven countries around the globe. Then in 2012, Mr. Milligan went on to create Sumo Retreats - a luxury, holiday property rental portal - along with his dynamic team of experienced professionals. The inspiration for this second venture came from the entrepreneur's own travel experiences. In the course of six years, Andrew Milligan had traveled to more than 50 countries and was constantly on the lookout for accommodations that made him feel at home - with little success. The frustration of never finding suitable stays fueled his determination to create a rental company that not only offers clients the convenience of instant online bookings, but also exceptional customer service throughout their holiday.","Commerce and Shopping, Community and Lifestyle",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
