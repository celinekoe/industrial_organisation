The Bumper Bot acts as front and rear DVRs (dash cams) that constantly capture footage in traffic. If an accident ever occurs, the owner will have footage of the event from the front and from the rear of his vehicle.  Bumper Bot is also a back-up camera that uses the users phone to deliver an audio or video signal to help the user park his car without backing into something. It also helps other drivers gauge their distance to an equipped car and captures video of anyone who may have damaged the equipped car during parking maneuvers.
