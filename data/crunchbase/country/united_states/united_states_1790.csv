Stephenson following the death of his mother, Mary Brown Stephenson. After being diagnosed with lung cancer in the 1970s, Richard and his mother quickly began to research treatment opportunities. They sought alternative remedies and care options relating to diet, exercise and spirituality. Mary's choices were limited. Few institutions appeared to understand, let alone value, the vital connection between one's physical health and their psychological well being. Mary passed away in 1982. While mourning, the bereaved Richard promised to forever alter the course of cancer treatment in America. Stephenson graduated from Wabash College in 1962 and earned his J.D. degree from Northwestern University. While studying at Northwestern, Stephenson founded the International Capital Investment Company (ICIC). In 1975, a Zion, Illinois, hospital was sold to Capitol Investment Company, and soon after the sale, Richard assumed the role of Chairman of the Board. After his mother's passing, Richard started the process to develop the hospital into the nation's preeminent cancer treatment center.  The facility reopened in 1988 as the American International Hospital and became the first cancer treatment center to implement and apply the Mother Standard care model, a patient-centered approach designed to provide those afflicted with cancer the same level of care that a mother would give her child. The Mother Standard system provided patients with traditional oncology treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, as well as alternative and emerging care options such as immunotherapy, hyperthermia, tumor biology and nutrition.These supportive therapies were designed to manage the side effects from intensive treatments like chemotherapy and radiation, and to enhance patients' quality of life.  Striving to enhance patients' quality of life, CTCA provided unorthodox care methods such as aromatherapy, detoxification, hydrotherapy, massage, naturopathy, acupuncture psycho-social intervention, spiritual support and even humor therapy. Set on empowering cancer patients and their loved ones with hope-fulfilling options for care, Stephenson declared, ""I never wanted to see another cancer patient suffer the agony of living without hope."" Constructed in 1958, the American International Hospital thrived throughout the 1980s, and CTCA opened their second hospital in 1990, the year prior, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, as part of the city's City of Faith hospital.  In June 1991, the Illinois Health Facilities Planning Board approved a certificate of need by a unanimous vote. The Zion City Council approved $20 million in bonds in September that year to finance the hospital's renovation, and the thirty-year-old facilities reopened, new and improved. In 1991, Richard founded the Gateway for Cancer Research and served Chairman. 99 cents of every dollar publicly donated goes to fund clinical trials. To date, the foundation has raised more than $75 million and funded over 140 cutting-edge clinical trials around the world. In keeping with CTCA's unorthodox but results-driven methods, December 1997 saw the establishment of the Cancer Resource Center. Gurnee Mills mall in Gurnee, Illinois became home to the center, a place Richard built to give all people the chance to learn and become educated via up-to-date articles and research materials. The center was located nearby CTCA's flagship hospital, renamed Midwestern Regional Medical Center.  As then-CEO of Midwestern Regional Medical Center Roger Cary explained the center's purpose to the Chicago Tribune in 1997, patients can find what they need ""in surroundings that are comfortable [...] instead of searching from place to place and in medical libraries"". CTCA closed out the 1990s with the opening of the Mary Brown Stephenson Radiation Oncology Center, built in Zion, near the American International Hospital. The new oncology center provided additional outpatient rooms and services and housed state-of-the-art radiation and rehabilitation technologies. In 2005, CTCA Tulsa opened a brand new, renovated hospital. The state-of-the-art facility became the only major hospital dedicated solely to cancer treatments in Oklahoma. CTCA Philadelphia opened their doors within the same year and began treating patients. CTCA opened their largest facility to date, at 210,000 square feet, in Phoenix, Arizona in 2008. The CTCA opened their latest center in 2012. As of 2018, CTCA Phoenix will begin delivering onsite chemotherapy and radiation oncology services at their Outpatient Care Center, located in North Phoenix. Cancer Treatment Centers of America's national network of fully accredited cancer hospitals have earned accreditation and certification from the Joint Commission, the American College of Surgeon's Commission on Cancer, the QOPI Certification Program and the College of American Pathologists (CAP). CTCA is world renowned for their high-quality care and for consistently exceeding patient safety standards from numerous healthcare organizations, such as the Association of Community Cancer Centers and the American College of Radiology. CTCA hospitals in Chicago and Philadelphia have been recognized by the Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy (FACT), a University of Nebraska Medical Center program. Four CTCA hospital locations have received awards from the National Accreditation Program for Breast Centers (NAPBC) for their breast center treatment programs. CTCA's suburban Chicago location has earned Magnet Recognition from the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) for excellence in nursing. All CTCA locations are striving to earn this designation; only 9 percent of hospitals in the U.S. can boast ANCC's Magnet Recognition.","Biotechnology, Data and Analytics, Design, Health Care, Science and Engineering",1,Richard J Stephenson,5001-10000,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Where pride and craftsmanship made a difference. Where the unique flavors of every business was allowed to shine – just like it does when walking down a city Main Street. Where you could grow your business by building a loyal customer base that could be next door, or on the other side of the country. For Shoppers: Imagine a website that made online shopping nearly as fun as real world shopping. Not just to compare prices, but to actually shop on. A place where you could get the feeling of walking down a real Main Street in any town, anywhere. Window shopping. Browsing. Feeling the thrill of discovering something you didn’t know you needed but just have to have. For an Investor: Let's remember about 40% of amazon's $70B  in sales last year came from 3rd party small businesses participating on the amazon web site.  But amazon doesn't share any customer information with the merchant, in fact they hide the merchant from the shopper.  How can you build a business this way? But what other option do the 3 million or so small businesses on amazon have? We have begun by creating a place where small businesses will be celebrated.  By joining together on ShopOnMain.com we can share shipping volume across 100s of businesses to negotiate rates with shippers.

To put it into context, it's a sort of cross between Digg, LinkedIn and MyYahoo. In a nutshell, its a social network that lets you find and share news based on your interests and location. One aspect of the service - each user has a customized Digg-like experience, effectively creating smaller niche versions of the popular social news site. That means niche publishers get to play, too. Today they are largely shut out of Digg. But popular stories from more obscure topics can get traffic traction through Mixx. Stories, video and photos can all be bookmarked. And Mixx hopes to partner with those publishing partners to provide easy bookmarking links back to Mixx. That will drive traffic back and forth, with both sides theoretically winning. Each user gets a customized home page with news items that Mixx thinks you'll find relevant. There are also links to overall popular stories, as well as categorized stuff like business, sports and health. Users can also create and join topical based groups, which allow them to further refine the news they submit and receive. In April 2008, Mixx released [an API](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/mixx_launches_innovative_api_c.php) that allows web services to view, submit, and comment on Mixx items and media. Amongst the newer social media sites Mixx competes with the likes of [Thoof](http://crunchbase.com/organization/thoof), [SpotBack](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/03/11/spotback-launches-their-rate-everything-widget/) and [Feeds 2.0](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/05/17/feeds-20-a-little-like-searchfox/).","Advertising, Content and Publishing, Data and Analytics, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Navigation and Mapping, Other, Sales and Marketing, Software, Video",1,Chris McGill,11-50,3,M&A,3500000,USD,3500000,3500000,USD,3500000,"Los Angeles Times Media Group, Intersouth Partners",2,2,,Private,,,,,,

We've also created a unique and compelling workplace culture that is recognized as one of the best in America. Hybridity Brings Clarity to Ambiguity Tackling issues of such complexity has required us to create a very different kind of consulting firm. Instead of throwing our weight behind a single discipline or even a multidisciplinary mixed bag of ideas, we have consciously cultivated a new type of office environment, a new kind of talent recruitment, and even a fundamentally new way of measuring the performance of our people. Our culture and environment of Team is every bit as important to the work we do as the methods and ideas we've developed over the years. Ruthlessly Committed to Our Clients' Success – Guaranteed Our business model is based on an idea that we think should be obvious: that a consultant's reward should be based on the happiness of the client. That's why if you work with us and aren't excited and inspired by the answers we deliver, we'll give you your money back or keep working on it until you are. For this reason we seek a relationship characterized by candor, integrity, and a pragmatic adherence to objectives over activities. We rely on the expertise and experience of our clients even as we bring to bear capabilities that are absent in the corporate world. Great Business Creates Positive Social Change Jump is committed to social change. We aim to solve the Big Needs that plague our society, whether they be the violence of modern life, the hardship of growing old, or the fraying of our communities. We recognize that the greatest engine of change in the last hundred years has been industry. It has won wars. It has created havoc. We believe that the most powerful harness of this awesome engine is a combination of heartfelt empathy, thoughtful strategy and compelling design. These disciplines reconnect capitalist activity with positive social change. For our clients, this can lead to massive financial reward. To help businesses change society, we need to help each and every company understand that right now, there are people in the world who could benefit from the help their firm could offer. And they're willing to pay for it. Doing so won't just transform the world. It'll give our clients what they crave most... a reacquaintance with the reasons they got into business to begin with.","Other, Professional Services",2,"Dev Patnaik, Udaya Patnaik",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

As the AI gets more accurate, so do the labels, so the annotation team can generate more labels faster than ever. The custom AI also drives our active learning system that automatically finds objects buried in hours of video and queues up the frames for the team to check. It adds the most helpful frames to the top of the queue, so the dataset gains the most valuable data first, and the model gets better faster. Finally, integrated dataset management and data science tools allow data scientists to run experiments and validate the dataset by training inference models in parallel with the labeling effort. No wasted time and money creating labels that aren't adding value to the dataset. Today, training a computer vision model can take months of multiple cycles of labeling, exporting, training a model, analyzing the results, and starting again to achieve success.

Galorath has invested over two decades of research and development helping organizations better plan and control project costs, quality, duration and risk. Leveraging sophisticated modeling technology and project-applicable knowledge bases, SEER solutions are proven to accurately replicate real-world project outcomes more quickly and with much greater accuracy than any traditional estimating methodologies.

An idea formed...What if customers could be assured that their mobile purchases were protected rather than exploited? What if carriers never received complaints? And the first iteration of WMC Global was born. We quickly began working with major US carriers to deliver PSMS Industry Monitor, an industry-changing market compliance system that identified the need for clear oversight and risk reduction in mobile purchasing.   We realized very quickly that if the US was having problems with mobile messaging, so too were other mature markets and over the next 5 years, opened offices in London, Sydney, Singapore, and Kuala Lumpur. In 2015, we launched Market Monitor, our newest iteration of the PSMS industry monitoring tool, and a year later, on the hunt for a richer data set, we launched SpamResponse.  Thanks to our work in compliance as well as advances in technology, we began to see new kinds of messaging coming through old channels. Phishing links were more commonplace, calls to care skyrocketed, and the integrity of messaging as a trusted channel was once again called into question. We decided that the only way to stop the marketplace from reverting was to offer a complete consumer protection suite, from pre- to post-campaign. Our Automatic Takedown services, Threat Detect, RISQ Score, and PhishFeed soon followed.  WMC Global now operates well beyond the mobile sphere, deploying customer and brand protection solutions that encompass all market verticals and digital service sectors that fall prey to scams. Our cybersecurity products are now the most sought after in our suite, and we are excited to grow our customer protection services in this direction.","Data and Analytics, Hardware, Information Technology, Internet Services, Mobile, Privacy and Security, Software",3,"Ian Matthews, Robin Thompson, Tony DeSanto",51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
