KKO is a trusted advisor to their clients, including as outside general counsel for many businesses. Their attorneys have worked with clients ranging from start-ups to Fortune 100 companies and have assisted clients with deals ranging in values from the thousands to the billions. Every client and project is different, so they work cooperatively with their clients to understand and meet their needs. Rather than herding clients toward ill-suited solutions and models created for others, KKO helps clients find opportunities and solve problems in a manner specially tailored for their particular circumstances. KKO works with clients on transactional legal matters, including mergers and acquisitions, private equity and venture capital investments, securities, credit finance, entity formation and commercial contracts. KKO also assists clients with general legal matters arising in the operation of their business, including documenting employment relationships, preparing incentive plans and maintaining company records. KKO does not employ attorneys with little or no experience. Their clients deserve experienced attorneys capable of providing practical advice and being trusted advisors and creative problem-solvers. KKO’s model ensures that their clients do not have to foot the bill for first and second year attorneys to obtain the practical skills they did not learn in law school. They hate over-lawyering as much as their clients do. They think it is about time that impractical attorneys without business sense stop being rewarded for being inefficient and unreasonable.

If a client or a project is small in size, it does not mean that sophisticated, expert legal service is unwarranted. KKO’s business model allows their experienced and practical attorneys to deliver value through efficiency and creativity. Since they do not hire attorneys without practical deal experience, they will never assign lawyers fresh out of law school to transactions and attempt to pass it off to clients as a bargain. KKO was designed to provide practical, personalized legal service while substantially reducing the administrative and infrastructure costs that are typically absorbed by clients.
