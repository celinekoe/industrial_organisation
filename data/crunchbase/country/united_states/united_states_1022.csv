Despite the relatively high number of patients suffering from gastrointestinal diseases and disorders, there are only about 12,000 gastroenterologists in the U.S. These physicians conduct over 31 million patient visits and write almost 40 million prescriptions each year valued at $4.8 billion. Also, GI diseases may limit or alter the effectiveness of traditional oral therapies due to the disease for which the product is intended to treat. By developing enhanced versions of currently approved drug products, through novel delivery formats or formulations, Evoke intends to provide patients additional treatment options. Evoke's lead product candidate, EVK-001, is in late stage clinical testing. The company has exclusive rights to a novel formulation and delivery of a currently marketed GI product.
