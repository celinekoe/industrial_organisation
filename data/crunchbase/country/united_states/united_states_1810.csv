Through uniting all devices CLEVR restores a fragmented market and adds a layer of discovery through viral channels. CLEVR has solved two problems…. 1)  Solved Fragmentation and Social.  CLEVER brought a fragmented VR market and fragmented social landscape into one unified HUD.  As we have all heard time and time again, ""mobile is fragmented.""  Virtual Reality only magnifies the problem. CLEVR has the solution. First, we've reversed engineered our way into every VR platform and brought together the connectivity, all devices can now talk to each other.  Secondly, CLEVR has taken all of the various social networks you use (Facebook, Slack, WhatsApp, etc) and brought those APIs into one feed, one single HUD.  All of your social connections are now in one single view. 2)  Made VR content discoverable.  We've done this through two approaches.  First, in our stand alone app, CLEVR displays what games your friends are currently enjoying and playing AND on which platform.  Secondly, we're creating an in-game HUD (SDK) for developers to use where players can pop up the CLEVR social network, within the content itself (games, movies, etc) thus allowing players to shout out to their friends on their social graph and invite them to the game.  Now VR content is discoverable through your social graph. SOLUTION/PRODUCT To the point, CLEVR is a social platform that unites all VR devices and allows users to discover new content (games, movies, any VR content).  A lot of buzzwords, yes. But every generation of platforms the same discoverability issues emerge. CLEVR is taking advantage of the black hole in the market and has taken first mover advantage.","Hardware, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Software",2,"??? ???, John Szeder",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The platform enables healthcare organizations to publish their own, branded mobile app with a suite of pre-built features for health summaries, appointment scheduling, messaging, urgent care wait times, physician search, patient education, bill pay, and more. Healthcare organizations can select from existing features while developing custom features – with the goal of having a single patient-facing app for the entire healthcare organization.  Today's consumer is engaging more and more with the world around them through mobile applications and devices, creating a minimum expectation that the businesses from which they purchase provide self-service tools in the form of a mobile app. In response to patient demand, many healthcare organizations have implemented “first generation” mobile apps; in many cases, providers have already begun accumulating multiple mobile apps, asking patients to download as many as four different mobile apps. This multiple, disparate mobile app offering makes it nearly impossible to engage a patient population, is expensive to maintain, and has lost the confidence of the patient. To date, healthcare organizations have been deeply challenged to meet this market demand for a modern, consolidated, and HIPAA-compliant mobile app. Without the necessary internal IT resources and knowledge to successfully create, market, and maintain mHealth applications, projects face imminent failure.
