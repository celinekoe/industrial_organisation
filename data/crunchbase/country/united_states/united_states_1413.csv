Goodwill, the largest company in the thrift business makes 3B a year revenue from the 20k tons of durable goods donated to them. They are projected to grow 10% this year. The closest existing example of the Montou Network is Ebay. Montou will be different from Ebay in a lot of ways, but Ebay's numbers are the closest example. Ebay does 3.9B dollars worth of business a year. Of its 112.3M users, 1.3M are sellers. The 3.9B in revenue is generated by those 1.3M sellers.  These numbers place Montou at the convergence of two giant markets. Of the ways there are to sell online, NONE are centered on the thrift market. Other than stand-alone, e-commerce stores, thrift is missing from the online marketplace.  Why?  Fee scales. None of the existing platforms use a volume pricing scale, they all use a highest price per item model. This creates a barrier to entry for Thrift selling.

Is your brand working for your business? Is it dated & irrelevant? Is it inconsistent or not fully developed? Does it match across all platforms from print to social media, digital to real life? The Outspective team provides the outside perspective you need to answer these questions and determine if you are right where you need to be, if it’s time for a refresh, or if your business needs to develop branding in the first place.
