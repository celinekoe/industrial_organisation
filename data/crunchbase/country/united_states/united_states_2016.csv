New technologies have converged to create a new marketplace for 3D. Inexpensive computers have become ubiquitous with unprecedented power to calculate and display imagery in 3D. However, without a complementary means to see in 3D, a computer is blind to the third dimension. Diffractive optics, once the preserve of high end spectroscopy laboratories and astronomical observatories, are now minted in polycarbonate plastic for the cost of their embossing, typically pennies. By joining the confluence of powerful computers and inexpensive optics, 3DeWitt is poised to trigger a revolution in 3D vision. 3DeWitt has patents on solutions that can fill a billion dollar marketplace for 3D acquisition instruments such as cameras, localizers, and graphical input devices.","Hardware, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The game uses check-in technology to create scavenger hunt like activities that encourage interaction between the customer and local businesses.  One way this is accomplished is through â€œHops.â€  Hops are groupings of activities based on what, type of activity they are, where they are located, or how complimentary the activities are.
