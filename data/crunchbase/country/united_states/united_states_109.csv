The Coalition for Barrier Free Living (CBFL) was established in 1975 by people with disabilities for the sole purpose of advocating for equal rights and opportunities. Two of the major projects of the Coalition included advocating for curb cuts in Downtown Houston and for the development of an accessible transportation system. In Houston, it soon became clear that people with disabilities are fully capable of bringing about change in the community, and teaching others in the process.  Five years later...  •	CBFL opened its first consumer-controlled service project... the Houston Center for Independent Living (HCIL). HCIL is a non-profit, non-residential community-based resource and advocacy center run by and for individuals with disabilities. HCIL staff members provide peer support and advocacy services that ultimately give others the tools to pursue freedom from dependence.  And now...  •	CBFL/HCIL continues to outreach to individuals who have limited or no access to services due to transportation problems, financial issues or lack of community support. In 1998, we expanded independent services in Texas by opening the Brazoria County Center for Independent Living (BCCIL) in Angleton, Texas. At BCCIL, people with disabilities from even the most rural areas of Brazoria County can benefit from our many years of experience in promoting independence for all. •	In 2004, the Fort Bend Center for Independent Living (FBCIL) opened its doors in Sugar Land, Texas. Fort Bend County is one of the fastest growing counties in the United States. Like BCCIL, the Fort Bend Center reaches out to a large population of rural consumers with disabilities, many of whom have always lived under the control of others. •	Their trained and qualified staff of individuals with disabilities are available to share expertise and experience in access and community living.
