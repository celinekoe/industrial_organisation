In 1996 Hoerni and Mortenson established Central Asia Institute (CAI) and appointed Mortenson as its director. Sadly, Hoerni wouldn’t survive to see the organization grow into an international, humanitarian force. Hoerni died in 1997 from myelofibrosis, a rare form of bone cancer, but Mortenson would dedicate the next two decades of his life to the charity.  Several years after CAI’s founding, Mortenson would co-author Three Cups of Tea, an account of his experiences in Pakistan. The book, a New York Times best-seller, and its sequel Stones into Schools, catapulted CAI into the global spotlight, giving the charity a powerful platform to advocate for peace through education.  Though Mortenson and Hoerni had no way of knowing when they first created the organization, CAI would change the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. Over two decades, CAI’s programs and projects have expanded into other far-flung regions of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan, many of them too dangerous or isolated for other organizations to reach.  CAI has been successful in these areas because it maintains that the best method for sustainable, widespread change is to initiate projects requested by the community – ask communities what they need, don’t tell them. This philosophy has proven effective time and time again. To date, the organization has initiated over 400 projects, and hundreds of new requests for help cross our desks every day. We look forward to tackling these future projects, because we truly believe the surest path to peace it through education. With education we can change the world, one child at a time.","Community and Lifestyle, Education, Other, Social Impact",1,Greg Mortenson,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

PureShield is seeking additional partners to assure PureShield attains a leadership position in the antimicrobial products industry.   To achieve this vision, additional financial and business resources are necessary. PureShield is the owner of four EPA registrations for a highly unique antimicrobial technology.  Product Sales produce GM % of 70%.   The technology utilized is completely dissimilar to that found in other conventional antimicrobial products now available for use in the market place.   Distinctively Unique Technology The technology employed by PureShield products is entirely unique to all other antimicrobial products and disinfectants. PureShield products mode of action is to remain “bound” to the applied surface. They work as a surface protectant, inhibiting microbial growth on the applied surface without the use of poisons or heavy metals. The concept is analogous to how ScotchGard® protects fabrics from dirt and moisture or Clear Coat protects today’s car paint from environmental damage. Our surface protectants shield surfaces from microbial activity. Due to the products being bound surface protectants, the benefits are never depleted, thereby providing long-term residual protection. All other antimicrobial/disinfectant products currently available employ an “unbound” leaching technology, meaning that they are not bound to the applied surface and therefore the benefits of the product diminish over time. In addition, the EPA allows it to be applied to almost any porous and non-porous substrates.","Financial Services, Lending and Investments",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Newage Testing Instruments was founded in 1954, originally named NewAge Industries, Inc. During the company’s early years, NewAge Industries produced metal hardness testers. Among the first hardness testers was the portable “Press-and-Read” testers marked under the models SR and MR Series. These handheld testers included an integral Rockwell scale, an indenter and sophisticated spring mechanism that displayed a Rockwell hardness result when the instrument was “pressed” onto a metal surface.  Through 2000, NewAge Industries continued to develop and introduce hardness testing instrumentation for metals for various testing methods: Rockwell, Brinell, Vickers, Knoop etc. The company also introduced durometers used for testing the hardness of rubberized materials. During these formidable years, the company expanded its manufacturing capability and built a strong reputation for quality, reliability and service.  In 2000, Newage Testing Instruments, Inc. was formed and the company became an independent entity- no longer part of the original NewAge Industries company.  In 2008, AMETEK acquired the Newage Testing Instrument company. The company became part of AMETEK’s Measurement and Calibration Technologies division, along with industry-leading brands including Chatillon and Lloyd Instruments. The division’s material testing business unit offers an impressive array of products and systems designed for material testing and characterization.","Consumer Goods, Manufacturing",,,,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

With other applications, social content usually gets uploaded from a single user, making it the responsibility of others to actively tag themselves later. This step really sets MOOODS apart from other social networking apps because users don’t have to passively add photos to joint albums, tag themselves or download offline. With MOOODS, users make social plans ahead of time so everyone knows who’s going, when and where. Once users attend they simply take photos during the event and the app does the rest.  As more users adopt this app, it will have a geo-local impact as attendance records grow. MOOODS will be able to grow its service to a point where users can see anonymous demographic data showing where others are planning to go. This will allow users to create better plans, ultimately sharing better moments with their friends and family","Community and Lifestyle, Content and Publishing, Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Messaging and Telecommunications, Mobile, Navigation and Mapping, Platforms, Software",4,"Maya Lior, Raphael Lior, Sandra Lior, William Pitzer",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
