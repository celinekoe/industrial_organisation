From the start, they  began the monumental goal of rebooting the NASCAR video game franchise. They first turned to Monster Games who developed NASCAR Heat and its sequel, NASCAR Dirt to Daytona. The team at Monster Games was excited to get back to NASCAR, and work began from ground zero on the first NASCAR video game on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Over the next few months, the talent at 704Games grew exponentially with game industry veterans joining their team to focus exclusively on the mission to rebuild the NASCAR video game franchise. NASCAR Heat Evolution was announced in May 2016 at the Sprint All-Star Race in Charlotte, NC. Carl Edwards raced his way onto the cover, a first for the driver and also a first for Toyota. After months of excitement, NASCAR Heat Evolution was officially released on September 13, 2016.  The team assembled has worked on all of the best NASCAR games in history. Their goal is to rebuild the NASCAR video game experience back to what it should be with fun, engaging, and competitive racing that captures the lifestyle and excitement that NASCAR brings to the track each and every week. NASCAR Heat Evolution was just the beginning. They wanted to deliver a solid foundation that they knew theycould continue to expand upon for years to come. At 704Games, they feel very confident they have achieved that goal and are excited about their  much-anticipated sequel that will be released in fall 2017. In addition to their console games, 704Games is focused on reaching mobile gamers as well. NASCAR Heat Mobile launched in April of 2017. This new, exciting iOS and Android game will place 40 NASCAR stock cars on the track together for the first time on mobile devices. It will also introduce a world-building component for fans to create the ultimate NASCAR empire. ​ As we look toward the future at 704Games, we’re focused on NASCAR and looking at new and emerging opportunities outside of the sport.
