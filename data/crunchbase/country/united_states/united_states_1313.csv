He joined with Bob Armstrong, another Rossler salesman, to formulate their dream of creating their own beauty supply distributorship in Corpus Christi, Texas. Following World War II, the Company relocated to Austin, Texas, where its headquarters remain today. By the mid-1960s, Dean McCall decided to sell the company-owned stores to independent distributors so that he could concentrate his efforts on the Central Support Center. This was a landmark decision and the beginning of the Armstrong McCall franchise system. From these beginnings, Armstrong McCall has grown to over 170 stores in the US Sunbelt and Mexico. Together with our affiliate, Beauty Systems Group LCC, a recognized national leader in the professional beauty supply industry, Armstrong McCall is a recognized force in supplying beauty salons and professionals with quality products and equipment. John Golliher currently serves as President of Armstrong McCall. Frank Fulco serves as Vice President of Operations/GM, overseeing the daily operations of Armstrong McCall from the corporate office in Austin.","Clothing and Apparel, Commerce and Shopping, Consumer Goods, Design, Manufacturing",2,"Bob Armstrong, Dean McCall",101-250,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

CEDaR has been developed by SIVOO and is proprietary to the Company. CEDaR creates digital video assets from any format or source including Satellite, Internet stream, hard media, or digital file; encodes captured video into any and/or multiple specifications like CableLabs, Flash, Windows Media, Quicktime, H.264, MPEG2, etc.; distributes these assets to any IP video or broadcast distribution outlet; and tracks the views and monetization of assets in a single report. With CEDaR, video assets are easily and automatically managed and distributed by and between MSOs, content aggregators, and distribution outlets. CEDaR allows customers to pull video assets between locations as either a file or as a stream-link on the Internet Edge. CEDR can also push video assets to Internet sites like YouTube and MetaCafe, mobile platforms like Verizon V-Cast, IPTV providers like Verizon FIOS TV and Verismo, and cable companies like Comcast. CEDaR distribution outlets include AOL, Brightcove, Charter Communications, eyespot, Grouper, Guba, HotWire, iFilm, iTunes Podcasts, Joost, jumpcut, JumpTV, MediaMelon, MetaCafe, MobiTV, MySpace, SES Americom, Terra, Verismo, Verizon FIOS TV, Verizon V-Cast, Videoegg, Vimeo, VOY, VSocial, and YouTube.

The company also manufactures shoe polish and other personal-care products under the Kiwi label. After a period of diversification in the 1990s, the company sold off several subsidiaries in the early 2000s to focus on smaller packaged-goods segments, such as foods and beverages, household products, and underwear and intimates.

We believe that respect for diversity among peoples and in nature is essential to a positive future for our planet and all its inhabitants. Arcus works to ensure that people of all sexual orientations and gender identities, and our fellow apes thrive in a world where social and environmental justice are a reality. SOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM: The Arcus Foundation’s Social Justice Program envisions a world in which all LGBTQ people live with dignity, safety, and opportunity in inclusive communities and societies. The foundation realizes this vision by supporting initiatives that increase safety for LGBTQ people, strengthen LGBTQ-affirming protections, and improve inclusion and acceptance of LGBTQ people. We give priority to LGBTQ populations who have been pushed to the margins based on their racial, gender, or economic status in specific places in the Americas and Africa, where research suggests potential for our work to contribute to concrete changes over a 10-year period. The Social Justice Program deploys finite grantmaking and non-grantmaking resources in ways that build the long-term resilience and power of our partners, so they can remain resolute in advancing justice, often in the face of ongoing violence, inequity, and exclusion. The program approaches its work in a manner that acknowledges and includes the wisdom, power, and self-determination of LGBTQ communities.  Social Justice funding addresses the following areas under all goals: --Cross-movement collaboration and coordination --Efforts led by and for the communities most affected by the work’s intended impact --Establishment of durable networks, especially among those most marginalized --Inclusion of those most marginalized in decision-making and organizational leadership --Initiatives led by faith, trans, and other groups with less access to resources and who are marginalized within LGBTQ communities --Work that empowers constituencies to influence change through civic engagement and democratic participation. GREAT APES & GIBBONS PROGRAM Arcus’ Great Apes & Gibbons Program strategy is driven by its mission to ensure conservation and respect for the world’s gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans, and gibbons, all of whom are under threat in every country in which they live. The program’s 10-year strategy, from 2016 to 2026, focuses on ape-range landscapes across 18 countries in Africa and Asia, as well as two countries, the United States and Kenya, in which apes are held in captivity outside their range.  The Great Apes & Gibbons Program strategy aims to: --Reconcile socio-economic development and conservation activities in priority ape landscapes --Build an effective movement of organizations and advocates addressing current and emerging threats to apes --Increase respect for the intrinsic value of apes, diminishing their exploitation and ensuring they are provided appropriate care.  The Great Apes & Gibbons Program currently prioritizes 24 landscapes based on ape habitat size, the distribution and density of ape populations, species diversity, threat level, current conservation efforts, and the existence of supportive institutions and legislation. Twelve of those landscapes are in pristine areas; 10 are in frontier areas; and two are in isolated areas. Across these landscapes, we support holistic, collaborative, and long-term approaches by a range of actors from the conservation movement and other sectors to promote behavior change, including policy and legal challenges, increase in monitoring and law enforcement efforts, expansion of sustainable economic opportunities for local communities, and development of strong public awareness of the issues, including through thought leadership. Arcus Foundation is the author of State of the Apes, the world’s first publication series looking at the threats and dangers facing great apes and gibbons and the opportunities for reconciling economic and social development with biodiversity conservation. Learn more at https://www.stateoftheapes.com/.  Arcus Foundation’s mission is driven by the vision of our founder and by our shared commitment to global human rights and conservation movements. We partner with experts and activists—brave advocates for change who push boundaries and confront tough challenges. Together, we learn from one another and take bold risks on groundbreaking ideas that drive progress toward a future of respect and dignity for all.","Other, Social Impact",1,Jon Stryker,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Bytemobile,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bytemobile,"Mobile, Subscription Service, Telecommunications, Video","Champaign, Illinois, United States",Bytemobile offers solutions enabling mobile network operators to improve the utilization and performance of their existing network capacity.,"252,717","Great Lakes, Midwestern US",,Closed,2000-07-01,day,2012-06-13,day,,none,For Profit,http://www.bytemobile.com,"Bytemobile provides Smart Capacity(TM) solutions to operators of mobile networks delivering video, web and multimedia services to their subscribers. Fundamentally, Smart Capacity solutions enable operators to improve the utilization and performance of their existing network capacity as subscriber data traffic continues to escalate. Numerous operators worldwide have experienced increasing pressure on capacity as a result of traffic congestion caused by faster networks, more sophisticated devices, richer content, and consumer demand for bandwidth-intensive applications such as high-definition (HD) video, streaming media, and one-to-one video communications (video chat). This trend, which has impacted operatorsâ€™ data revenue growth and profitability, is expected to continue with the commercial roll-out of Long Term Evolution (LTE) and other 4G networks. Bytemobileâ€™s products are designed to deliver Smart Capacity to mobile networks â€“ without the traditional requirement for new wireless spectrum or infrastructure build-out. The principal benefits to operators are: 1) better control of network capital and operating costs in the face of increasing traffic congestion; and 2) consistently higher quality of experience (QoE) for subscriber s accessing video and web services on mobile devices. Superior QoE leads to improved customer acquisition, retention, service adoption, and data usage â€“ and therefore increased revenue growth. Bytemobile offers operators two Smart Capacity platforms: 1) the Unison(TM) Platform, which is carrier-grade software deployed on industry-standard server hardware for processing video and web traffic through mobile networks; and 2) the T3000 Adaptive Traffic Management System (T-Series), which consists of a fully integrated network element, deployed in the core, for managing traffic across Layers 2-7 of the network stack. Bytemobile Smart Capacity applications include video optimization, web optimization, content caching, policy control, traffic management, and network analytics. Bytemobile was founded in 2000 to optimize high-bandwidth data services on wireless networks designed for low-bandwidth voice services. In 2001, the company completed its first commercial network deployments. Today, Bytemobile has deployed more than 125 mobile network operators in over 60 countries. A few of the company's customers are AT&T, China Mobile, China Telecom, Cricket Communications, Deutsche Telekom, Indosat, MetroPCS, O2, Orange, TelefÃ³nica, TeliaSonera, and Vodafone. Bytemobile has global supply agreements in place with major telecommunications groups operating networks and serving subscribers across multiple geographic regions. The company maintains research and development centers and sales and support offices throughout Europe, Asia and North America.","Hardware, Media and Entertainment, Mobile, Other, Video",1,Constantine Polychronopoulos,251-500,2,M&A,38100000,USD,38100000,38100000,USD,38100000,"Trident Capital, Benchmark, Innovacom, Eastven Ericsson Venture Partners",1,4,1,Private,,,,,,
AudioQuest,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/audioquest,"Consumer Electronics, Electronics, Logistics","Irvine, California, United States",AudioQuest has been the largest cable supplier to the high-end specialist market for many years.,"252,720","Greater Los Angeles Area, West Coast, Western US",$10M to $50M,Active,1980-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,http://www.audioquest.com/,"AudioQuest was not so much founded as it was evolved. When Bill Low created AudioQuest in 1980 it was really just a small variation of the audio activities he had started in 1972. During high school and early college, Bill had struggled to have the best audio system he could. He had built dozens of Heathkit and Dynakit amplifiers, preamps and tuners for classmates. Each US$10 or $15 he earned building kits went to buy records or to upgrade to a better piece of used equipment. While at college in Oregon, Bill realized that instead of simply offering audio component recommendations to other students, he should sell the equipment. His small appointment-only business evolved from selling BSR turntables and Hitachi receivers in 1972, to Linn Sondek, Radford, Celestion and Yamaha (first dealer in the Northwest) in 1974. In 1975 his little shop was the largest Linn Sondek dealer in the US. By 1976, with college long over, the urge to move to California was irresistible. The retail business was passed on to a friend and Bill set himself up as a manufacturers’ representative in northern California, an especially conservative market. Dealers were fond of saying: “If I don’t already carry it, I obviously don’t need it.” It was difficult to even get a chance to demonstrate the superb equipment was representing, which included Decca, Audionics, Koss Electrostatic, AEA, Dunlap Clarke, and Celestion among others. During visits to southern California, Bill learned that the two markets were very different. The standard answer from the southern dealers was: “Sure, bring it in and let’s listen.” So, in 1977 Bill moved south. Unfortunately, the combination of open-minded dealers and excellent equipment (Cizek, Decca, RAM, Koss Electrostatic, RH Labs, PSE, Ariston, Armstrong, Rogers, Chartwell) still didn’t work. The truth was (and is) that Bill was just plain not good at selling! He never became a professional salesperson, he never learned how to sell other peoples’ products. After six years inside the audio business, both as a retail proprietor and a manufacturers’ representative, Bill once more started a by-appointment-only store out of his living room in Santa Monica. This time Bill made one small but very important decision … he decided to make custom audio cable for his store. Audio cable became a visible subject in the US in 1976 when Polk Audio introduced a Japanese sourced cable under the name Cobra Cable. This high capacitance/low inductance Litz cable encouraged some amplifiers into self-destruction, but it usually made systems sound better. By 1978, Polk, Bob Fulton, and Jonas Miller Sound had made audio cable an important subject for those at the leading edge of audio. Since the 1960s, Bill had appreciated the advantages of using better than average cable. In 1977 Bill bought a spool of the 12 awg lamp cord that Noel Lee (future “Head Monster”) was selling to his dealers in northern California (Bill and Noel used to sub-rep each other’s lines in the two California territories). In 1978, Bill and another small retailer cooperated in ordering a custom-made twisted pair litz speaker cable. In some ways Bill is embarrassed to remember this cable which he refers to as “original recipe” … it had 435 strands per conductor and didn’t use very good copper. However, as a starting point it was really very good. It clearly outperformed the Fulton Gold cable that was considered top-of-the-hill at that time. It was spiraled and it did not have any electrical contact between bare strands. Over the next two years, Bill manufactured this cable, and a second smaller model, simply with the intention to sell them in his small store. However, other dealers in the Los Angeles area began to buy this cable from Bill. It was also distributed in Japan. In 1980, Bill realized that it was time to make cable for the purpose of selling to other dealers. He started AudioQuest. The evolution of AudioQuest cables has taken place over the entire life of the company, however several of the most important basic design criteria were established very near the beginning. These basic priorities were established as a result of empirical experience and not by abstract theorizing. By the end of 1980, AudioQuest was selling to forty-two outlets in southern California and one dealer in Denver. In January of 1981, AudioQuest exhibited for the first time at the CES (Consumer Electronics Show) in Las Vegas. A month later, AudioQuest was selling in Europe, Asia and most of the US. Over the following twenty years Bill has continued to refine his understanding of the mechanisms that cause distortion in cable. There has been a logical and rational progression leading up to today’s extremely coherent line of audio, video and digital cables. In 1987 Bill first published a paper he titled “Cable Design; Theory versus Empirical Reality.” Even though every cable in the AQ line has improved since that time, the basic priorities Bill laid down in 1987 have not changed. His ability to implement those priorities has evolved and surely will continue to evolve. In 1987 Bill also started to design and manufacture 75Ω video and digital cables. These were not warmed-over audio cables. They were dedicated designs based on the same fundamental low distortion principles as the audio cables, but which took into account the different priorities required for wide bandwidth applications. Over the years the video and digital range grew to include a full line of “S,” “component,” and RGB video cables, and cables optimized for long runs of very delicate signals such as from a satellite dish or for HDTV. In 1999 this whole family of cables was grouped under the CinemaQuest sub-brand. While a picture alone does not stimulate an emotional response as effectively as audio, the ability to use an emotionless video test pattern to objectively prove superior video performance has helped make AudioQuest/CinemaQuest’s home theater business a lot of fun, and very successful. AudioQuest has been the largest cable supplier to the high-end specialist market for many years. AudioQuest is sold in several hundred outlets in the US and in over sixty countries. Bill is especially pleased that this success has been possible despite his insistence that the foundation of the company, and the foundation of AudioQuest marketing, must be the performance of the product. In the audio world, many professionals have learned that it is not always convenient to listen to the products they sell … they might learn something they don’t want to know! Bill has always understood the challenge of basing the existence of AudioQuest on the performance of the product. However, to Bill, this is the only reasonable way to do business and the only acceptable way to combine his passion for music (and all things high performance), with his need to make a living.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Transportation",1,William E.

An active person, Seth was continually in search of the perfect drink to quench his thirst after a run, a game of basketball or between grad school classes. Yet, Seth found most drinks either too sweet or too tasteless. Barry Nalebuff, Seth’s professor at the Yale School of Management, found that he and Seth shared a passion for the idea of a less sweet, but flavorful beverage during a class discussion of a Coke vs. Pepsi case study. They agreed that there were tons of sweet options and lots of watery drinks, but in 1994, there was nothing in between to fill the void. Fast forward to ’97. Seth goes for a run in New York City with a college friend who used to concoct juice drinks with him after class. As they found themselves doing the same beverage mixing after the run, Seth knew then that if he was going to quench his thirst for good, he would have to create the drink himself. He e-mailed Barry to see if he was still excited about the idea. Timing was everything. Barry had just returned from India where he had been analyzing the tea industry for a case study. Among other things, he came away with the impression that the tea many American companies purchased for bottling was the dust and fannings left after whole tea leaves had been brewed. Barry had even come up with a name to describe a bottled tea that was made with real tea leaves–Honest Tea. When Seth heard the name, the simmering idea began to boil–it was the perfect name for an all-natural brand that would strive to create healthy and honest relationships with its customers, suppliers and the environment. Seth took a deep breath, quit his job at Calvert mutual funds, and started brewing batches of tea in his kitchen. Five weeks after taking the plunge, he brought thermoses of tea and a recycled bottle with a mock-up label to Fresh Fields (Whole Foods Market). The buyer ordered 15,000 bottles, and Seth and Barry were in business–if they could figure out how to make that much tea. They did, and they’re still at it 15 years later. In March 2011, The Coca-Cola Company purchased Honest Tea after an initial 40% investment in 2008, which helped expand the distribution of HONEST® beverages.  Today, Honest Tea is run as an independent business unit and their HONEST TEA®, HONEST ADE®, HONEST KIDS®, HONEST SPLASH™ and HONEST Fizz beverages can be found in more than 100,000 stores across United States.  The dream that took root in Seth’s kitchen in 1998 became a company that just celebrated its 15th anniversary.  Seth continues to run the business as the President and TeaEO in Bethesda, MD with the same passion towards health, the environment and social responsibility.","Consumer Goods, Food and Beverage, Sustainability",2,"Barry Nalebuff, Seth Goldman",51-100,1,Private Equity,12000000,USD,12000000,12000000,USD,12000000,"Inventages Venture Capital Investment Inc., Stonyfield Farms",,2,,Private,,,,,,
