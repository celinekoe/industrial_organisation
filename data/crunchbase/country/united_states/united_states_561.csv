It sets the bar for creating top-quality Muscadine Wine, Vinifera Wine, and Fruit & Berry Wines.  Dennis Vineyards has 2 wedding venues, multiple ceremony sites, 2 ponds, a gazebo at the smaller pond, about 45acres of vines that produce double to triple the grapes of the other regional vineyards, about 20 acres in total, over half a million gallons a year capacity, highly maintained bottling machine from Italy, all the wine making equipment for that capacity, over 25 wines produced including some french varietals, two houses that sit on the property, as well as the third grape harvester ever made for muscadines and custom made pruning equipment and the above normal level of farm equipment.  The vines were planted by founder Pritchard Dennis and his wife Lynda after they took a trip to Spain in the 1970s.  They discovered their passion and deep appreciation for wine. Upon their return, Pritchard, the multiple business owner that he was began to research all things wine.  With books upon books, notepads and calculators, he devised his plan as he had done many times in the past, which included Brick Plant, Farms, Concrete Plant, Airport development, Commodities Tradings, small-scale fishing business, the vineyard, and finally the winery.  The idea cultivated and matured until finally in the late 1980's he decided to take the plunge into making his first batch as a hobby winemaker. They were so happy with the results that they made more batches and began donating wine to the local Lutheran Church they attended.  Word spread that he had fantastic wine.  1997 the family founded the Winery and in no time they made national news for having the highest antioxidant and Resveratrol content of any winery commercially available according to a Perdue University study.  Won almost every win contest in NC and a lot of the Southeast US while entering.  After 20+ years of a multi-award winning brand and a loyal customer base.  Featured Media:  News papers, articles, PBS Episode ""From the Vineyard"" S800Ep5, various websites, a couple of nutrition websites (not affiliated nor do we imply health benefits), national news, and a few mentions from affiliated businesses and agricultural related entities.","Agriculture and Farming, Food and Beverage",2,"Lynda Dennis, Pritchard Dennis",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
