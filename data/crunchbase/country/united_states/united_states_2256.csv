We ski, snowboard, hunt, camp. We walk our dogs, commute to work, watch sports, and even party outside on New Year’s. Whatever gets you out there; you want to stay warm. Well you’ve come to the right place! Our gear is made with extremities in mind; to keep your hands, feet, face, and head warm and protected. And not just warm enough to grit through it. We mean really warm. Like, surprisingly warm.   COMFORT & FOCUS We’d like you to know two things about Seirus Innovation. First: we believe in comfort. We use the latest fabrics, the most advanced technologies, and a remarkably unique R&D process that’s delivered new forms of comfort every year since 1978. We don’t follow industry trends, we follow comfort. We were the first to bring rechargeable heated gloves to market, and we own 19 patents aimed at making your outdoor experience warm and comfortable. Second: we focus on extremities. That’s it! Other companies spread their focus across base layers, jackets, and sometimes tents. The only thing we think about is redefining all-weather comfort for your head, hands, and feet.   DOING THE RIGHT THING We believe in continually improving our processes to be more sustainable for the sake of the environment. Through our adoption of solar power at our office and warehouse, a move to biodegradable materials over plastic bags, and more we have greatly reduced our carbon and waste footprints. As a family business we know we’re all in this together, so we take care for not only the environment, but our employees, our partners, our suppliers, and of course our customers as well. Our Outreach page shows some of the amazing institutions we are proud to collaborate with in this industry, all of whom are working tirelessly to preserve and bring the joy of the outdoors to everybody.   WHERE WE STARTED Our skills at innovating comfort started back in the late 1970s. Co-founders Joe Edwards and Mike Carey, both avid skiers, each invented a new product that made skiing better. After joining forces, they created a unique R&D culture where everyone at the company critiques, tests, and designs products in an ongoing cycle of invention and reinvention. It leads to great products that get better and better.",Sports,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

We utilize both the Invitae Genetic Test and the Myriad myRisk® Hereditary Cancer testing. The Myriad test is a 35-gene panel that identifies elevated risk for eight hereditary cancers. There are a host of genetic pathways and mutations that a patient may have (including BRACA 2, BRCA1, HOXB13, ATM, CHEK2, and CDK1), and they can tell us whether or not a patient is likely to respond well to a particular agent. For example, we know that a patient with positive BRCA1 and especially positive BRCA2 gene mutations will most likely have a shorter effective run with the androgen-blocking drugs Xtandi® and Zytiga®. Another lab test analyzing serum is called a “droplet digital PCR assay,” and it can also help us determine which patients will best respond to those chemical agents, Xtandi® and Zytiga®. It should be noted that genetic markers are also important in light of the patient’s family history. We want to know what the family history is with regard to other cancers. We can see that a patient’s daughters may be prone to breast cancer or ovarian cancer; and now even colon and pancreatic cancers enter the picture in the spectrum related to prostate cancer. These cancers are essentially on the same page in our genetic makeup. Melanoma is also now seen to be genetically related to prostate cancer, and all of these cancers may occur at increased frequency in the patient tested. Both Xtandi® and Zytiga® have a side effect profile similar to that of hormonal therapy. With patients for whom Xtandi® and Zytiga® are not effective or are unlikely to be effective as indicated by positive genetic markers (BRCA1 and BRCA2), we may prescribe Lynparza® (olaparib), which is known as a PARP inhibitor (poly ADP-ribose polymerase). Many patients fare quite well with Lynparza®. Another immunotherapy agent, Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) is known as a PD1 inhibitor. We are finding that patients who are not responding well to Lynparza may benefit from Keytruda. The Dattoli Cancer Center, has a growing arsenal of medications at our disposal for patients with advanced or recurrent disease. Both hormonal therapies and immunotherapies are associated with far less toxicity than chemotherapy as they are “targeted therapies” While genetic testing is important for the patient’s siblings and children, (and also for the patient on occasion), there is even greater importance in sampling the actual cancerous tissue removed from the patient in order to identify somatic mutations. This is known as comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP). This test can help identify exactly which treatment may benefit the patient (e.g. AR-7 mutations suggest resistance to Xtandi®/Zytiga® while HRR gene mutations predict response to Lynparza). Checkpoint inhibitors (e.g. PD-1) suggest sensitivity to pembrolizumab. We have been using FoundationOne ®CDx as the best genomic test currently available for identifying somatic mutations. This test searches 324 genes for cancer-relevant mutations in the DNA.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",1,Michael Dattoli,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
