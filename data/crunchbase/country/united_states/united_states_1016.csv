Many inquire about how we came to work with the names that we do, and the answer is two-fold. Firstly, we work with a broker that has over 20 years experience and is known as THE #1 outsourced marketing firm in the country. Their reputation has acquired the likes of clients that top the Fortune 500 list. After experiencing sub-par results from indirect marketing methods (billboards, radio ads, tv commercials, etc), big brands turned to our broker to handle all face to face customer acquisitions, and our broker turned to us. The second reason is Redwood Consultants' ability to incur all advertising, hiring, onboarding, and training costs to produce the best representation and results for our clientele! By increasing the number of new customers, retention, and satisfaction of existing customers, Redwood Consultants' clients have returned the favor by creating ample advancement opportunities for team members. With a clear and concise growth path, we look to train entry-level marketing and sales professionals into successful campaign managers. An emphasis on merit-based growth and advancement ensures our client is represented by the cream of the crop. Redwood Consultants proves that with the right team, training, and principles in place, rapid growth is possible. With our sights set on expanding into two additional cities in the next year, ambitious, competitive, and goal-oriented are three of the many adjectives we would use to describe our growing team.

As many Digg clones and alternative models are failing or have failed to take hold of a substantial user base, Thoof brings a slightly new take on getting your daily stories which it hopes will attract more than a niche audience.  Thoof is an automated news recommender of sorts.  It works similarly to many music recommendation engines such as [Last.fm](http://crunchbase.com/organization/last.fm) and [Pandora](http://crunchbase.com/organization/pandora), by displaying articles you might like based upon your past reading history.  Readers submit articles in a Digg-like fashion, but don't vote to get the articles on the front page.  Founder Ian Clarke, formerly of video site [Revver](http://crunchbase.com/organization/revver), claims that with video as well as news, many people may read articles but few will vote on them.  Clarke hints that the passivity of news and video consumption may ultimately weed out news aggregators that cannot automatically deliver customized news.  However, Thoof users are allowed to edit the news by suggesting alternative links.  If link changes are to stand they must get enough votes from the rest of the community. Thoof has many web 2.0 elements including article tagging, wiki features and aforementioned recommendation engine.
