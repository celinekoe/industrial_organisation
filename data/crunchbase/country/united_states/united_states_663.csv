According to Evelyn Rusli of TechCrunch, here's how Unsocial works: ""A user signs up via his or her LinkedIn account and Unsocial uses that profile to collect basic information on the personâ€™s career. The user inputs 'smart tags,' or rather keywords, that describe his/her professional background (for example you might include 'journalist,' 'writer,' or 'technology') and the traits of people s/he is seeking. When youâ€™re ready to use the application, you simply open it up and click on the first button, 'People,' which will show you relevant, nearby matches, if you find someone you want to connect with you can send a direct message through the platform (or e-mail/call them if that information is available). The service is ideal for large conferences or similar events where attendees have a limited amount of time to identify high-value contacts.""","Apps, Community and Lifestyle, Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Internet Services, Messaging and Telecommunications, Mobile, Navigation and Mapping, Platforms, Software",,,1-10,3,,935000,USD,935000,935000,USD,935000,,,,,Private,,,,,,
