Located in Mequite Texas, since their founding in 1991.  Ushering in a new era of interactive entertainment with genre-defining blockbusters like Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM and QUAKE, id has secured itself a place in gaming history as one of the fathers of the modern video game.  They were one of the first game shops to make the shareware distribution model work.  It all began on May 5, 1991, when id Software, fresh off the heels of its success with the Commander Keen series of titles, gave the PC gaming world a glimpse of the future with the shareware release of Wolfenstein 3D. A shot of pure adrenaline, Wolfenstein 3D thrust gamers into a frenetic first-person universe of relentless action that would forever change the face of gaming.  Widely recognized as the original first-person shooter, Wolfenstein 3D was later inducted into the Computer Gaming World ""Hall of Fame"" for shaping the overall direction of the video game industry.  Then, on December 10, 1994, id unleashed DOOM on the world. A technically stunning opus of heart-stopping action, unspeakable horror and pure gaming bliss, DOOM heralded a paradigm shift in video games. Hardcore PC games were going mainstream.  Selling millions of copies and chalking up tens of millions of downloads as shareware, DOOM remains one of the most popular PC games ever. And the title's impact on the gaming world is still felt today.  With DOOM, id Software put the shareware distribution model on the map, with the game's runaway success owing a debt to the growth of Internet distribution. The company has continued to support shareware and other non-traditional means of distribution, influencing the way companies market and sell video games.  DOOM also introduced multiplayer gaming to the masses, allowing players to compete in intense 4-player LAN or head-to-head modem competitions.  id Software didn't stop there, the team of innovators also made DOOM's source code available to their fan base, encouraging would-be game designers to modify the game and create their own levels, or ""mods."" Fans were free to distribute their mods of the game, as long as the updates were offered free of charge to other enthusiasts. The mod community took off, giving the game seemingly eternal life on the Internet. In fact, id discovered many of their current employees and development partners based on mods that were created and distributed over the Internet.  DOOM and its sequels went on to enjoy tremendous sales on virtually every gaming platform available - from the Sega Genesis to the Game Boy Advance.  The next quantum leap in PC gaming came from id Software in 1996 with the release of QUAKE. Based on an all-new graphics engine, QUAKE was the first truly 3D video game, allowing players to interact with the virtual worlds created by id like never before. Gamers were free to look and move in any direction, giving the game designers at id the freedom and ability to create incredibly immersive environments in this epic, single-player game.  id Software continued the tradition of QUAKE, with QUAKE II in 1997. Supporting multiplay for up to 32 players simultaneously, QUAKE II was a watershed hit for the company, selling more than one million copies, despite it's steep hardware requirements. By now, it had become clear that id's games were reason enough to upgrade, or even buy, personal home computers.  In 1999, the easy-going guys from Mesquite further cemented their place in gaming lore with the ultimate deathmatch experience, QUAKE III Arena and the QUAKE III: Team Arena add-on pack. Designed to be the ultimate multiplayer experience, QUAKE III Arena has become the defacto standard for professional gamers and is the game of choice for tournaments around the world. A QUAKE III Arena tournament is the centerpiece of id's annual QuakeCon tournament and LAN party, played every summer near the company's headquarters in Mesquite. QuakeCon 2001 winners alone pulled in a combined $50,000 in cash and prizes.  In 2001, id Software teamed up with Gray Matter Interactive and Nerve Software to develop Return to Castle Wolfenstein, a re-imagining of the original classic, Wolfenstein 3D. Built around the Quake III Arena graphics engine, Return to Castle Wolfenstein introduced a new generation of gamers to the epic series that started it all. In its first two months of release, Return to Castle Wolfenstein shipped over one million units worldwide, and has been widely acclaimed as one of the best computer games of 2001.  The company also has enjoyed success licensing its revolutionary technology to other developers. To date, id's game engines have powered blockbuster titles from other producers, including Call of Duty, Soldier of Fortune, Half-Life, Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, Star Trek: Elite Force, Heretic, Hexen and more.  In August of 2004, id Software released the next chapter in the DOOM legacy, Featuring a new, mind-blowing gaming engine from John Carmack, bringing a terrifying new storyline based on the original masterpiece.","Commerce and Shopping, Gaming, Information Technology, Software",2,"John Carmack, John Romero",51-100,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

NASCAR,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nascar,"Racing, Sports","Daytona Beach, Florida, United States",NASCAR is the sanctioning body for one of North America's premier sports.,"169,304","East Coast, Southern US",$500M to $1B,Active,1947-12-14,day,,,,,For Profit,http://www.nascar.com/,"NASCAR sanctions more than 1,200 races in more than 30 U.S. states, Canada, Mexico and Europe. Known for its passionate fan base, one-of-a-kind playoff format (Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup), development of the modern sports sponsorship and commitment to enhancing auto racing through technology, NASCAR produces many of the most highly attended sporting events in the world. NASCAR did not gain the success or popularity it has today overnight. The sport has evolved to entertain its fans and continuously prosper. In 2003, NASCAR made two major announcements to help the dawn of the new era become even clearer. NASCAR announced in June that Nextel would become the new series sponsor in 2004, replacing R.J. Reynolds' Winston brand after 33 years. Three months later in September, Brian Z. France was named as NASCAR's CEO and Chairman of the Board replacing his father, Bill France. A steady parade of changes has followed. The Chase for the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup was announced at the start of 2004, ushering in a new format to determine the champion of NASCAR's premier series. In 2006, Toyota announced a move into all three of NASCAR's national series. In 2007 it was announced that the premier series' name would be changed to the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series beginning in 2008. In addition, Nationwide Insurance was announced as the replacement for Anheuser-Busch as main sponsor of NASCAR's series born from Late Models in 1982. The 2007 season also marked the beginning of NASCAR's new car in premier series competition, a car designed to be safer than ever while also reducing costs to compete -- all the while enhancing the racing itself. The new car could not slow down Jimmie Johnson who captured a record five consecutive championships from 2006-2010, becoming only the second driver to win three consecutive titles (Cale Yarborough 1976-1978). During the late 2000s, NASCAR began further expanding by creating series internationally. The NASCAR Canadian Tire Series and the NASCAR Toyota Series (Mexico) launched their inaugural seasons in 2007. The sanctioning body extended its reach across the Atlantic when it founded the NASCAR Whelen Euro Series in 2012. Today, NASCAR runs three national series, four regional series, one local grassroots series and three international series. In 2013, NASCAR continued enhance its racing, debuting its Gen-6 car that enhanced body designs to better resemble the cars found in showrooms across the United States and improve on-track performance. NASCAR also secured its television rights through 2024 by agreeing to a 10-year rights deal with NBC Universal and an eight-year rights extension with FOX. To emphasize winning races, NASCAR created a new Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup playoff format for 2014 and unveiled its new grid format for advancing drivers.",Sports,2,"Brian France, William France Sr.",5001-10000,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Private,,,,,,

Because what you read matters.,"169,955","Greater Los Angeles Area, West Coast, Western US",Less than $1M,Active,2012-04-01,day,,,,,For Profit,http://www.moptu.com,"Today, basically everyone gets their news on social media. Unfortunately, as the number of people getting news on social platforms exploded, no single platform ever evolved specifically to serve that purpose.  In the old days, newspapers and TV news were just that: News, and news only. That's how people consumed news for generations. So why was there no place for a socially networked approach to the most important events of the day? News on social media was always mixed with an endless list of distractions like memes, kitten videos, and even things like posts about what your friend had for breakfast. We call those distractions ""social media noise,"" and we are the only logical solution: Moptu.  While memes, animals videos, and more narcissistic content is fun: the events of the last few years have PROVEN that social media has moved past being a fun way to pass the time. We are now in an era where social media is the primary venue for content consumption representing the most vital areas of society. Not only are we the only social platform dedicated to news, we represent a new, mature form of a technology whose structure has never matched its potential. Until now. That is why we have articles ONLY: organized by topic, searchable, curated by our users, and with no algorithms or censorship. You get to choose if you want to see all posts or only articles posted by the people you trust: friends, family, or anyone else. You choose what you see, and not a faceless algorithm.  The format itself is familiar, we have likes, shares, comments, and posts just like every other social media platform. Posting is made simple by just a copy and paste, the use of a bookmarklet, or in app.  We are already up and running with a browser version and our iOS app in the Apple App Store.  We’ve achieved proof of concept: our users have posted 300 thousand articles which have generated 85 million views. We have 25 thousand Monthly Active Users.    News consumed on social media is the natural progression of people’s desire to actively interact with each other and discuss and/or debate key societal issues ranging from politics, health, sports, travel, entertainment, food, psychology, and almost 20 additional topics.  It allows news to be an active activity instead of a passive one. Many social sites include news among their various purposes, but ONLY Moptu makes news THE primary activity.  Our format, and focus on articles, puts news from a large variety of sources, about an even wider variety of subjects, directly in front of users. Our users become both the curator of content, and the driving force of content sources.    Would you rather go on Facebook and Twitter and scroll through your feed to find important articles scattered among memes, kitten videos, comments, or instead go to a platform where the ONLY thing you see, instantly, is articles? And it's a place where you can see what everyone has posted, or only those articles posted by who you follow, just by flicking a switch. Like all platforms, we have influencers, but on Moptu, anybody can be an influencer, because it is about what stories you curate, not about who you are. Our team consists of two Southern California natives, best friends, and collaborators for over 40 years. University of Southern California and Brown University graduates.   Moptu IS the future of social news.","Internet Services, Media and Entertainment",2,"Charles Haspel, Josh Namm",1-10,1,Seed,125000,USD,125000,125000,USD,125000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

They are thought to be the earliest sign of solid tumors, and they can be detected in a simple blood sample. CTCs reflect the current state of all cancer sites and offer a thorough prognostic insight into a patient’s cancer. The capture and characterization of CTCs from blood promises to guide the use of highly targeted therapies – i.e., “personalized” medical treatment – and to enable much earlier detection of primary cancer.      Current CTC equipment is slow, expensive, offered as an outsourced service, and is not sufficiently sensitive to provide useful data. Only one CTC instrument is currently FDA approved, and it suffers limited use and a poor reputation because it takes over 4 hours, misses entire classes of CTCs, and does limited cellular characterization.     AxonDx’s nCYTE™ technology scans un-enriched blood samples in minutes, finds all classes of CTCs shed by solid tumors, and offers morphological and outsourced molecular characterization of positive cells. The nCYTE™ approach is fast, vastly more accurate, compact, easy to adopt, and cost effective enough to be offered at the point of care. Collectively, the nCYTE™ advances represent new era, game-changing improvements over all existing CTC detection technologies.
