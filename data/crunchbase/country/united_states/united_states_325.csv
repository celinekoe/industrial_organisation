Consumed by fear of losing everything they own if they miss one loan payment, some of the most vulnerable women have been excluded from the microlending sector, despite the fact that microfinance was originally envisioned as a tool to help the most vulnerable. Intimidated by borrowing from traditional microlending institutions, but eager to financially contribute to their families, the women we work with have been eagerly awaiting a lending model that place the quality of life for individuals and communities over the size of portfolios and repayment rates. Zawadisha was created to fill this gap and to offer an alternative lending opportunity for women, one with flexible repayment rates, transparent terms, and training. Women choose to borrow from Zawadisha because we prioritize the development of local leadership to leverage social capital in lieu of collateral. Rather than penalizing poor women for taking risks to create new businesses and invest in their families, we engage them as decision-makers and leaders in the organization, determining their own unique policies and guidelines. We are building and maintaining a flat organization where decisions are made through consensus and everyone’s voice is heard. We believe this non-hierarchical organizational style allows us to remain agile and flexible, giving us the ability to iterate our program designs to fit the most pressing needs of our members, which are currently centered around water, energy, and food security. Our members determine policies that best work for their particular group, and lending plans are co-created and individualized to meet the needs of diverse communities, understanding that what may work in urban cities like Nairobi might not work in rural towns like Kilgoris. Our model is building a stronger world, one in which women are self-sufficient, successful, and stand on their own two feet. We believe that this allows us to avoid the potentially harmful “one-size-fits-all” approach that characterizes similar work in the field of women’s economic empowerment.","Community and Lifestyle, Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Other, Social Impact",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
