Welcome to nuyu, the first women’s fashion lifestyle brand born on college campuses. nuyu offers college women something truly new: the chance to support their team and look fashionable. Face it – if you’re a college student, and you want to show school spirit, your choices have been limited to the standard gray sweatshirt, designed for a man, and the basic cotton tee. nuyu's here to provide the option you’ve been waiting for: high quality but affordable stylish women’s fan fashion, in the form of a collection of athleisure wear, dresses, swimwear, and intimates designed to allow you to wear your school colors but still dress in your own style-NOT one imposed on you due to lack of choice. What does the nuyu brand stand for? Our motto is: Just because our garments have a label on them, doesn’t mean you have to have one too. Your terms, your life. At the core of the nuyu spirit lie two simple ambitions: first, to make you feel confident, self-assured, and empowered when you wear our clothes, at a time of vital transition from teenager to adult, undertaken in the challenging college environment. Second, to accompany you on your journey of self-discovery...from leaving home for the first time, to realizing yourself as you leave the second ‘nest’ of college life to enter the world of true adulthood-living on your own and pursuing your dreams, whatever they may be. It is our goal that you, the nuyu girl, will wear our clothes in a way that suits you on any given day—but in doing so, as you slip a shirt over your head, or slide into a pair of leggings, you’ll smile to yourself with inner confidence, and a feeling of hope for the day ahead.","Clothing and Apparel, Commerce and Shopping, Community and Lifestyle, Design, Education",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

They have operated as a Child Caring Agency in the State of Florida for the past 12 years. Their new business goal is to expand the agency first in Florida and then nationwide by also becoming a Child Placing Agency.  First, they will obtain a state contract as one of Florida's Lead Child Welfare Agencies providing Family Foster Care Placements, Adoption Services, Teen Independent Living Services, Case Management Services, and Counseling Services. They will recruit new foster families who will be trained to provide care for foster children (especially hard to place foster teens). They will provide their foster families with 24-hour Supportive Services to maintain a successful placement of the children in their home. These services will include weekly in-home counseling to foster teens, in-home Independent Living Coaching, and Crisis Prevention training to the foster parents as well as a host of other services as needed at no cost to the foster family.  They will also have a competitive edge in recruiting foster families because they will reimburse foster families according to the true cost of caring for a foster child. Many state foster care child placing agencies are actually reimbursing their foster families between 30% to 190% below the actual cost of care. This causes foster families to be at an economic disadvantage by having foster children in their home.  CKM Inc.'s Child Placing Agency expansion will also give us an extreme competive edge within the adoptions arena. As a child placing agency, they will automatically be able to provide adoption services. Their agency will handle private adoptions in-house and financially streamline the adoption process. This will reduce their adoption fees to approximately $3k instead of the current rate that other agencies charge for private adoptions ($22-30k).","Education, Health Care, Other, Social Impact",2,"Cynthia Webster, Scott Webster",11-50,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
