Since its founding in 2006, the company has experienced tremendous success as a result of its tireless dedication to providing excellent customer service and high-quality products to the Northeast region. Although the company sells just about every fruit and vegetable, their main fortay is supplying berries to stores throughout the region, a practice that is typically very difficult given the short shelf life. Berries are not just sensitive based on seasons, but also environmental pressures in general. Therefore, Elite Farms needed to master the perfect ecosystem to store and maintain their berries until their customers could purchase them and get them on their own shelves. The process doesn’t stop there of course though. Given the company’s dedication to their customers and retailers, they always want to offer the longest possible shelf life at peak freshness.  Owner Avi Yusufov is no stranger to the food services industry. As a child, he grew up around his father's supermarket. Avi loved being a part of the distribution, attending trade shows and venturing to markets with his father.This early experience with his father taught him the value of working hard. You can’t achieve without effort and drive. It also taught him that success in business requires dedication and commitment to every customer. Many members of Avi’s family are business owners as well, something they all take great pride in. In fact, a large percentage of the businesses that Elite Farms serves are privately owned by Avi’s friends and family members. This tight-knit circle pushes the Elite Farms to the next level. They never want to let their customers down, but they also know their family and friends will absolutely let them know if they don’t deliver on their promises. It’s that sense of accountability that has pushed a lot of the growth and customer service elements of Elite Farms. Now Avi gets to be a part of the process he admired so much as a child as the owner of Elite Farms.

Repatriation Group International,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/repatriation-group-international,Association,"Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States","Research, Educate and Assist developing countries.","1,863,434","Great Lakes, Northeastern US",Less than $1M,Active,,,,,,,Non-profit,http://www.repatriationgroup.org/,"The Corporation is organized exclusively for charitable and educational purposes within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the US Internal Revenue Code. Its business includes, but is not limited to, researching, training and assisting developing countries to recover as much as possible of the billions of euros lost through government corruption each year. They are guided by the conviction that combating corruption is the single most important action that can be taken to reduce bloodshed, poverty, disease and environmental degradation across the planet. Their programs include semester long university courses, overseas workshops and training for government law enforcement officials, and confidential assistance to law enforcement agencies on cross-border corruption and money laundering cases. Their international training sessions are usually tailored to specific countries using research on the countries’ own laws to create a simulated case involving 50 to 60 pieces of evidence that participants investigate over a five-day period. You cannot learn to build a car engine, fly an airplane or fight corruption with college-type lectures. You must get experience by on-the-job training or working through simulations. Their training is state-of-the-art, but they are limited by the fact that they can only train up to 25 people at a time with in-country programs. Therefore, they are adding two more training platforms for those countries and organizations that have larger needs. This brings their number of training options to three: Standard in-class, computer based model where participants download 50-60 pieces of evidence and work through a simulated exercise to identify instances of corruption, trace money flows, and recover the stolen assets with the aid of facilitators. The training is usually delivered by instructors on-site in the host country, using host country laws and procedures; Internet based model where participants work through a simulated case online with the aid of on-line facilitators (video-taped lectures and PowerPoints are studied at strategic points); and Video-game based model in which the entire exercise is completed through a fully-animated, interactive simulation. In the game, participants will be taught investigative techniques and procedures, then challenged to apply them properly to advance through the case. At the end of the simulation, users will be scored on their use of investigative techniques, the charges they are able to prove, and the assets they are able to recover. The standard model has been used at George Washington University Law School for 6 years, and in numerous overseas training sessions for the past 8 years. The internet model has been developed for the World Bank for use by the 135 member countries of the International Corruption Hunters Alliance and has been in use since April, 2015.  The video-game model has been under development since March 2012 at Drexel University in Philadelphia, and starting May 2015, they began looking for funding assistance to complete the programming and to customize the exercise for the first 5 countries. The video game model is being designed to allow the setting, language, and legal content to be rapidly customized for each participant country or organization. Even the plot of the game can be customized to focus on specific types of corruption and money laundering such as drug money trafficking, police corruption, or political corruption. On average, the game will take around 20 hours for a participant to complete; during which users will learn and apply a variety of real-world investigative techniques from surveillance to financial document analysis to Mutual Legal Assistance requests. The game enables participants to use any of these investigative techniques at any point in the game – but only the right choices will uncover new leads. This broad range of choice combined with scoring, means that critical thinking and problem solving are emphasized over “guess and check”. Additionally the scoring creates a sense of excitement and competition while allowing training administrators to verify learning. People around the world are spending 3 billion hours a week playing video games for fun, and armies and airlines have been using video simulations for training for years. A 2012 report by the New Media Consortium identified “game-based learning” as one of the major trends affecting broader education in the next five years. RGI is working to make this technology available to every country that wants better governance and needs to improve its skills in the fight against corruption and money laundering.",Other,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
