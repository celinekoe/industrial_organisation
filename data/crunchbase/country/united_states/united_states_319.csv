In 1957, John Poles and Mel Tublin left the employ of a larger law firm to join Michael Patestides and form their own partnership. Poles, Tublin & Patestides was primarily an admiralty practice, although the firm was involved and active in other areas as well, including real estate, immigration and estate work. In 1960, Christ Stratakis left his post as counsel to a shipping company and joined the firm, which later added his name to create Poles, Tublin, Patestides & Stratakis.  The firm steadily developed its international maritime practice along with its general, commercial, real estate and litigation practice. During the 1960s and 1970s, their reputation was built on the handling of admiralty cases and commercial real estate transactions. With its offices in the heart of New York's financial center, and just a short walk from the courthouses, the firm has consistently provided legal advice geared to business-oriented results, but always ready to pursue all legal remedies available. Since 1975, Poles Tublin has enjoyed a meaningful association with a law office in Piraeus, Greece to better serve its expanding Greek clientele. There, Costas Roussos and Zafiris Hadzidimitriou established a successful practice, while maintaining their close association. The succeeding decades brought an expansion of practice areas to corporate, civil and commercial litigation, and estate matters. The firm’s real estate and litigation expertise and services were broadened with a merger in 2003 with Gonzalez & Weichert, a New Jersey firm with a thriving real estate and litigation practice. In its five decades, the firm has developed a reputation for serving the interests of its clients with professionalism, dedication and loyalty. In an age where values are hard to find, they still have these precious commodities in large supply. And the partners of Poles Tublin have always been known as lawyers you can trust. Whether the client is a Greek ship owner, an American bank, an international corporation, or an individual, the word their clients invariably associate with the firm is ""trust."" As the legal and commercial worlds have changed, Poles Tublin has remained a hearty port in that storm. They're proud of that legacy and today, after more than 50 years of practice, they continue to serve our clients with a unique combination of personalized service, dedication and trust that has been our hallmark.",Professional Services,,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Pet Country began circulating a nationwide price list and soon adopted the slogan ""The Reptile Leaders"".In March of 1991, the business had grown to a point where expansion was appropriate (if not necessary). The decision was made to open a second store. This time, though, the store would deal exclusively with reptiles, amphibians, and all their needs. Prehistoric Pets was born.The first ""Prehistoric Pets"" was opened in Chino, CA. Many of the animal displays rival those of the best zoos! Plans were now underway to convert Pet Country into a Prehistoric Pets as well. The name on the price lists was changed, and Pet Country began using the new name. In 1992, Pet Country closed to make way for a new, 5000 square foot superstore which had been completed in Fountain Valley with the name ""Prehistoric Pets"".",Commerce and Shopping,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Description: Primary Care Physician. Your primary care physician is your first stop on the path of good health. In general, you have only one primary care physician: your main, go-to doctor who’s responsible for your overall health and treatment. In the past, these physicians were known as family doctors or general practitioners. Today, they’re called primary care physicians, primary care providers or simply PCPs. You schedule all your yearly physical exams and other preventative health care appointments with your local Manhattan primary care physician. This doctor works with you in the same manner a general practitioner once did — often using diagnostic skills to determine what you’re suffering from and if you’re at risk of developing future health problems. Your PCP provides your treatment options and recommends the best course of action to get you well and keep you healthy. Your primary care physician serves your entire family, from your baby to your grandfather. As a generalist, your PCP can act as an internal medicine doctor, pediatrician or gynecologist whenever needed. An internist is trained in preventing, diagnosing and treating the most common medical conditions. Internists are doctors of internal medicine, occasionally referred to as the doctor’s doctor because other physicians turn to them when they’re seeking help on a difficult or baffling diagnosis. Just like the family doctors of years past, you call your PCP first when you or a member of your family is feeling sick or has been hurt. If you wake up with the flu or your child has an earache, your primary care physician is more than ready to help you feel better and get your child back to school. Additionally, your primary care doctor can help you manage any chronic condition or illness you suffer from.
