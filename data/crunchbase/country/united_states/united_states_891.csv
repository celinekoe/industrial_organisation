They can also be used to heat water and produce electricity. Solar panels are becoming more popular as the cost of renewable energy decreases and the awareness of the environmental benefits of solar energy increases. Solar panel technology has come a long way in recent years, and there are now more efficient and less expensive solar panels available.

So although the winter may be long, the panels will still be able to generate power during those months.

We offer a range of products at significant discounts. Magic? Here's how we do it: Many retailers are willing to sell their products for lower-than-retail prices, but on one condition: they have to sell a lot of them. Unfortunately, most retailers don't know how to guarantee that they'll find enough buyers. Here's where we come in. At NumbersPay.com, we display a wide array of products from retailers at abnormally low prices. When you sign up as a NumbersPay user, you can pledge to purchase any of the products we show. For the deals to actually go through, we need a minimum number of pledges before the deal expires. When this happens, the retailers are happy, the deal is official and your order ships at the end of the time limit. If the minimum number of pledges isn't reached by the time limit, the deal is cancelled and you aren't charged a thing. But this is where it gets interesting. For many items, as the number of pledges grows we can continue to lower the prices they're offered at. Once the number of users pledging to buy an item reaches a bonus marker, its price drops by a certain percentage. Many of the items have multiple bonus deals, so by letting your friends know about NumbersPay and encouraging them to join, you can increase your chances of getting better and better deals. It boils down to this: the more people buying an item, the less it will cost. And we've integrated the site with online social networks to make sharing easier. Get the Deal Getting started is simple. Subscribe to our newsletter and follow us on Facebook or Twitter to start receiving notifications about our latest deals. Once subscribed you will be in the loop and be the first to find any of our products at groundbreaking prices.In order to continuously tailor our shopping experience to our users, we have the suggest a product survey that lets your input guide our next offers. Sign up for free and give it a try! Buy it! Find an item you're interested in? Simply click the Buy! button to make your pledge. Remember, only the minimum pledge quota needs to be met in order for the deal to go through. You won't be charged a dime if your deal doesn't go down! Share, Share, Share! The fun part for you and your wallet is sharing. In addition to prices going down as more users pledge to buy, our Refer & Save system actually gives you NumbersPay credit for getting your friends to sign up. Get a NumbersPay link connected to your own account at any time by clicking the Refer & Save button at the top of the page. Let the Good Prices Roll! Sit back, relax, and bask in the great deal you just received courtesy of NumbersPay.

Desert Biker Magazine,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/desert-biker-magazine,"Advertising, News","Blythe, California, United States",Desert Biker Magazine is a chronicle of the desert roads of the Southwestern United States and the motorcyclists who ride them.,"2,577,993","Greater Los Angeles Area, Inland Empire, West Coast",$1M to $10M,Closed,2013-09-06,day,,,,none,For Profit,http://desert-biker.com,"Desert Biker Magazine is a chronicle of the desert roads of the Southwestern United States and the motorcyclists who ride them. A popular bi-monthly, 4-color  print magazine, Desert Biker Magazine has been in business for a year now and has published six magazines, each bigger and better than the one previous.  Their free publication features compelling, well-written stories and exceptional photography that has earned it a trusted reputation in the biker community. They've been repeatedly told it's the best looking magazine on the market and because they go so fast, they can't keep them stocked up at their major distribution points, primarily Harley, Indian and other motorcycle dealerships. They also hand out thousands to bikers at runs, rallies and other events throughout the southwestern desert region, allowing us to meet and converse with their readers, face to face.  Due to the quality of this publication, they've caught the eye of industry icons and are in talks with many of the motorcycle world's leading manufacturers  to provide an avenue of promotion for their products at a level beyond any they have advertised in before. Surprisingly, Desert Biker Magazine is a family business that consists of just two people who together handle production of the magazine, ad sales, subscriptions, business management and distribution. Due to the incredible demand for Desert Biker Magazine, and after a year of intense marketing, they are now at the stage of major expansion, meaning they need to increase distribution within and beyond their current Arizona, California and Nevada markets. That kind of expansion takes a great deal of capital in that printing and shipping costs are substantial and their biggest expense at this point.  It is their belief though, that those costs will very quickly be recovered by the increase in advertising revenue as they are more and more often approached by businesses that see the value of their product and understand the stability and wealth most biker possess.","Advertising, Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment, Sales and Marketing",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
