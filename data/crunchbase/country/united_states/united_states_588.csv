Phase 1a/1b data presented at the American Society of Hematology’s 59th Annual Meeting in December 2017, the 16th International Symposium on Amyloidosis in March 2018, the American Society of Echocardiography 29th Annual Scientific Sessions in June 2018 and the American Society of Hematology’s 60th Annual Meeting in December 2018 support CAEL-101’s potential to be a safe and well-tolerated therapy that promotes amyloid resolution. The data also demonstrated a correlation between a sustained decrease in N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels and an improvement in global longitudinal strain (“GLS”) following CAEL-101 treatment in patients with cardiac AL amyloidosis.  CAEL-101 has received Orphan Drug Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a therapeutic agent for patients with AL amyloidosis, and as a radio-imaging agent in amyloidosis. In January 2019, Caelum signed a collaboration agreement with Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Alexion”) to advance the development of CAEL-101.  Under the terms of the agreement, Alexion acquired a minority equity interest in Caelum and an exclusive option to acquire the remaining equity in the company based on Phase 2 data for pre-negotiated economics.

Laser imaging currently relies on Time-Of-Flight measurement, measuring the timing of light pulses hitting target and returning to receiver. This method has inherent limitations that has prevented 3D imaging quality improvements and application of technology within new sectors. Alternative methods require lasers to sweep across a range of frequencies, with incumbent technologies relying on kinetic technology which suffer from low speed, low durability, and susceptibility to vibration and shocks. Insight Photonics has developed a solid state all-semiconductor akinetic swept laser chip which can image faster (2-20x), with higher resolution (10x), and with higher sensitivity (10-100x) than current competitors, using Optical Coherence Technology (OCT). Akinetic operation results in greater durability and reliability than competitive OCT solutions, whilst also offering higher quality output at broad range of wavelengths. No moving or thermally operated elements allows for faster response-times and greater flexibility with software-controlled activity.","Hardware, Science and Engineering",2,"Doug Zahn, Michael Minneman",11-50,1,Early Stage Venture,,USD,,,USD,,EMV Capital,,1,,Private,,,,,,
