We uniquely address the largest unmet need in CSF Management; the high rate of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt occlusion. VP shunts fail at a rate of 50% within 2 years and 80% within 5 years, contributing to repeat revision brain surgeries (each costing upwards of $40,000).  Conceptualized in 2014 in collaboration with Boston Children’s Hospital and spun out of Alcyone Therapeutics in 2018, Anuncia’s patented portfolio of technologies provide peace-of-mind through innovation to improve daily quality of life for the millions of underserved patients with hydrocephalus and other CSF disorders and their families, who suffer from the clinical, economic, and emotional burden of repeat revision brain surgery due to VP shunt occlusions. Anuncia’s core platform has an elegant mechanism of action using a simple finger depression of a soft silicone dome located under the patient’s scalp to produce a noninvasive, retrograde flush of the patient’s own CSF to restore flow through an occluded catheter and prevent emergency surgery. ReFlow’s initial clinical evidence of flow restoration and reduction of symptoms via acute intervention flushing with follow-up up to 3 years, led neurosurgeons to evaluate ReFlow for prophylactic occlusion prevention in their high-risk patients. Ground-breaking clinical data, now out up to 2 years with 100% success, suggest ReFlow is safe for at-home, prophylactic flushing by patients or caregivers to extend shunt life and eliminate revision brain surgery. Supported by these encouraging results, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted ReFlow Breakthrough Device status in 2021, making it eligible for regulatory and reimbursement advantages. With existing profitable reimbursement, Anuncia plans to launch its next-generation ReFlow Mini product line in Q2 2022 and continue clinical studies to support market adoption and premium reimbursement.  With Breakthrough status and strong health economic advantages to improve hospital quality metrics and support New Technology Add-on Payment (NTAP) for rapid market adoption and premium pricing; Anuncia is positioned to be the leader in CSF management and help patients live fuller lives.  ReFlow’s unique ability to improve patient access to noninvasive lifesaving therapy at home or in the clinic and to improve clinical outcomes and quality of life, and reduce healthcare costs, earned it an Honorable Mention in the Fast Company 2021 World-Changing Ideas Awards and landed it on MDDI’s The Ultimate List of Private Companies to Watch.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",2,"Elsa Chi Abruzzo, PJ Anand",11-50,2,Seed,1000,USD,1000,1000,USD,1000,Arizona Tech Investors,,1,,Private,,,,,,

We support students in grades Pre K through 12 with in home and online, private tutoring services. Our top tier instructors pinpoint academic strengths and weaknesses and create personalized educational plans for students. Specializing in assessment testing, educational consulting and career development, we don't just help students study for a test. Jump Start Tutors nurture students with holistic learning practices, enabling them to achieve their dreams. Our flagship SAT Program currently boasts an average increase of over 180 points, saving local families hundreds of thousands of dollars on college tuition costs. As the cost of college has increased over 20% in the last ten years, the average graduate owes $32,700 before starting their first job. Although SAT prep is key to college entrance and scholarship funding, the average cost for private tutoring is between $45- $125 per hour.  To make test prep more accessible, affordable and effective, we are expanding our services to include education technology software products- that do not require the assistance of a private tutor. ​Our goal is to redesign our SAT program with AI/ML technology to provide students access to a highly effective and adaptive learning experience. Our product will be cost friendly and will lead to higher test scores with shorter prep time. In the future, our edtech SaaS platform will expand to include more tailored learning courses highlighting test prep, career exploration and emotional wellness courses.","Community and Lifestyle, Education, Other, Social Impact, Software",1,Chrissybil Boulin,1-10,2,Seed,250000,USD,250000,250000,USD,250000,"Newchip Accelerator, Chisos Capital",,2,,Private,,,,,,

Clark was initially focused on developing a powerful semiconductor chip (called the Geometry Engine) that would allow small computers to produce sophisticated three-dimensional graphics. The idea was revolutionary because before this, graphics simulations were often (if not only) done on large mainframe computers. Hollywood entertainment companies like Lucasfilm and Dreamworks SKG, music video producers and even Disney used SGI products to bring their artistic visions to life. Because of SGI's innovation it was possible to create the T-1000 villain in Terminator 2, the morphing towards the end of Michael Jackson's ""Black or White"" video, the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, and even animate Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast."" The 90s weren't just a time of creating quality entertainment for all ages. It was also a time of change within the company and developing new insights. Graphics and simulation software weren't the only products the company produced. In the late 90s, SGI's Chief Scientist at the time, John R. Mashey coined the term ""Big Data."" As a result of this new phenomenon, SGI already had a head start in further developing its workstations, supercomputers and solutions to meet today's extreme data growth. SGI's specialty of developing high performance computers only increased in 2009 when another change occurred. Rackable Systems purchased Silicon Graphics Inc.'s assets and decided to rename the surviving company, Silicon Graphics International Corp. While we may legally be a completely different company, we have a legacy of over 30 years of experience innovating and developing relevant solutions for our customers. We've come a long way from only focusing on graphics in the entertainment industry. Now, we are a global leader in high performance solutions for compute, data analytics and data management. Our solutions enable all of our customers (financial institutions, governments, manufacturers, the healthcare industry, retail, universities, automakers, research facilities, even those in the entertainment industry) to accelerate time to discovery, innovation and profitability. Our ICE™ and UV™ systems are some of the fastest commercial supercomputers in the world. As an added bonus, they are also at the top of the list in terms of energy efficiency. If you've got Big Data challenges, we've got solutions (after all, we did foresee this unique development in the late 90s). When it comes to your storage needs, we offer Intelligent Data Management, Scalable Lustre® Suite Solutions and the InfiniteStorage™ platforms. Our open-systems-based storage solutions leverage an intelligent combination of leading storage technologies to produce tailored systems that meet both performance and budget objectives.
