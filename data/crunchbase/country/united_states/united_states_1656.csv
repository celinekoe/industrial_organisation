One industry has rather quietly demonstrated a differentiated ability to reach those financially excluded populations. That industry is Wireless Telecom Carrier/Operators.     Inside and outside of the Telecom industry, most (understandably) view the Telecom Carrier business as one that provides communications networks.  Certainly Telecom's wireless networks have brought connectivity to virtually all remote corners of the world.  In parallel, the are now over 7B wireless accounts as mobile phones are close to reaching total ubiquity throughout the developed and developing world.    The other crown-jewel of Telecom Carriers is their known and trusted billing capabilities and direct billing relationships ... a core-competency that visionary and courageous leadership of Telecom Carriers globally are increasingly appreciating, harnessing and expanding - especially as it pertains to helping bring financial inclusion solutions to the financially excluded globally.   Many who have had responsibilities for leading Carrier innovation with Commerce related initiatives know that there were countless strategic and tactical issues encountered and overcome.  From legal and regulatory issues, to financial risk challenges, IT design questions, awareness driving and obstacles to encourage adoption and usage, customer care and trust building ... countless issues impacting strategy and tactics of all stakeholders in the ecosystems of sectors of Carrier Commerce that help advance financial inclusion globally.  The knowledge-base of FINCCLUDE's global membership is continually growing - a free resource that can help save time and expenses on strategic and tactical matters that our members have faced and overcome.       Unlike typical industry associations, membership in FINCCLUDE is free.  By eliminating the traditional pay-to-play model, FINCCLUDE's ""industry-knowledge-community""  has access to optimal brain power globally, optimal 'knowledge-cells' from all levels of management, any age, any stakeholder in any of the ecosystem sectors of Carrier Commerce that help advance Financial Inclusion, from any nation.  We are industry experts with insights, experiences and passion for this space. While significant progress with advancing Financial Inclusion has been achieved by Carrier Commerce already, there is significant work ahead to financially include the remaining 2 billion.  FINCCLUDE is ready to help global industry ecosystem stakeholder colleagues involved in providing Financial Inclusion solutions via Carrier Commerce by harnessing the expertise and success-knowledge of our members ... our proof-of-concept operational strategic and tactical knowledge.  FINCCLUDE's help impacts the industry and thus impacts advancing financial inclusion ... faster.  FINCCLUDE's success-knowledge information sharing approach is proven model of AFI (Alliance for  Financial Inclusion - which receives millions of dollars in funding assistance from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation).   While AFI promotes and develops evidence-based 'policy' solutions that help to improve the lives of the poor"",  FINCCLUDE harnesses and shares success-knowledge and best practices to help carrier commerce address common financial inclusion related 'strategic and tactical operational challenges' that help improve the lives of the poor faster, plus sustain important progress and momentum.",Other,1,John BaRoss,101-250,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

SuppLuxe believes that taking your supplements shouldn’t require an instruction manual, various scoops, or multiple containers. That’s why they created an easy to use all in one supplement subscription box customizable to fit your individual regimen. Each box contains a roll of supplements packaged by serving, according to the regimen you select on their website. You can change the supplements you want each month with the click of a button, allowing your regimen to adapt to fit your ever-changing needs. Their convenient packaging fits into any backpack or luggage for travel, or you can simply tear off a few packs on the way out the door. SuppLuxe eliminates forgetting your supplements, picking through countless pill bottles before work, and measuring your powders before starting your day. It’s as simple as grab and go, and with the box being shipped to you monthly, you’ll never waste time picking up or preparing supplements again. Whether you’re a young professional trying to balance a stressful job with a healthy lifestyle, stay-at-home mother trying to set a good example for her kids, or one of our brave servicemen staying in tip-top shape, SuppLuxe wants to help. “This is the new, streamlined way to get exactly the supplements you need, exactly when you need them,” says Founder Lee Hurlbert, and with the ability to tailor each box to fit each user’s fitness goals, he’s spot on.

This is a credit repair software package which will manage your entire business at a modest price. Their software does it all from managing the prospects with a CRM system to complete workflow management with credit bureau letters and creditor letters. One issue that often plagues credit repair companies is clients who owe you money. Their automated billing module really helps with managing those problem paying clients. Their software uses the highest security protocols and is hosted on high bandwidth solid state drive servers. Their software was developed by credit repair professionals FOR credit repair professionals. It’s not just a slogan – it’s their history. Too many other platforms were developed by organizations who did not understand the credit repair companies needs, were developed by programmers who really did not understand day to day credit repair, or by companies who were just concerned with making a buck and later left their subscribers without help and support. Their software platform was launched to fill what they perceived was a void in the credit repair community. Their goal is to listen to their clients and continually improve their product to make your life easier in our ever evolving and changing market of credit repair. Another important reason to consider Credit Admiral’s credit repair software is not their software, but their community. They have a vision of a united credit repair industry, that together, can lobby against the all powerful credit bureaus. Credit Admiral software supports NACSO (National Association of Credit Services Organizations). In fact they support NACSO so much so that they will be crediting your 12th and 24th months payments to your NACSO membership dues if you are a member in good standing!",Software,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
