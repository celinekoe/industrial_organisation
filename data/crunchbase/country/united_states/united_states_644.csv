Hospitals allocate operating room (OR) time using block scheduling—a system that dictates specific days and times during which surgeons can schedule surgeries. Block schedules often do not coincide with actual OR demand, resulting in poor resource utilization and suboptimal financial performance. As such, OR managers must navigate a unique set of resource-related challenges that are not addressed elsewhere in the hospital setting. Operating Analytics’ vision is to improve hospital management through the use of data analytics. Its first product disrupts a paradox that hospitals face: access to OR time is restricted for scheduling surgeries, while OR time frequently goes unused. The Operating Analytics system interfaces with existing scheduling products and converts stored data into actionable knowledge to support intelligent decision-making and resource allocation for ORs. While other companies perform predictive modeling, Operating Analytics positions itself as the only one that focuses on OR demand forecasting and decision support.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Health Care, Software",3,"Rick Maher, Ryan Graue, Tejas Shah",1-10,1,Seed,50000,USD,50000,50000,USD,50000,"Healthbox, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts",,2,,Private,,,,,,
