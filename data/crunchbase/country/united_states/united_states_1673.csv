We not only make your desires our number one priority, we also ensure that safety is of the utmost importance for you and your family, business, and property. We offer a vast array of services just like every electrician, including panel upgrades, fixing and installing breaker boxes and fuses, and transitioning your home or business to be more energy efficient. We also have a deep pool of knowledge in terms of lighting, including florescent, incandescent, and LED bulbs for your residential area, or more powerful bulbs, such as sodium-vapor, for commercial and industrial needs. We have worked with all types of ballasts and circuitry, from old school 120 volt, 15 amp circuits, to specialized industrial circuit breakers of 400 amps and above.  However, none of this means anything if it isn't what you need. So give us a call at (949) 430-6907, and we'll discuss the particulars of your project today. Because we are electrical contractors, not just electricians, we have the licenses, experience, and insurance necessary to conduct business in your areas of need.  Have a new build? We can draft plans to ensure that each room is properly wired. Outlet placement is extremely important. While most rooms have outlets either at eye-level or on the floor, sometimes floor outlets (to charge your devices while sitting on your couch) or ceiling outlets are necessary (to have a nice big fan for warm days). The number of switches in a room, and their placement, is also important. It can be confusing to have a switch in one room that turns on a light bulb in another room. While that is a rare occurrence these days, it is pretty common to see less skilled (or lazy) electricians have a switches operate fixtures that are on opposite sides of the room, making it confusing to turn off the lights at night before going to bed. We would never do that, at least without consulting you first (if you like confusing light switches...)  In any case, we are Irvine's Top Electricians for a reason: our skill and expertise, our ability to deliver on-time, and our customer service. We put you first in everything we do.
