Metadata-based search and video playback make managing and sharing imagery simple. We connect all imagery to a set of base maps and  clients can then bring in any GIS map they want as a layer. Map formats we support include Esri shapefiles, kmz, and kml and the MISB format for video used by DoD, the intelligence community and the National System for Geospatial-Intelligence. Survae uniquely provides a platform that supports any organization that needs to view, manage, find and share a lot of video or imagery from multiple sources. Survae is built to support not only virtually any kind of data-enabled imagery from multiple devices, but also from disparate sources -- different service providers, internal and external users, and multiple viewpoints (aerial, ground, and submarine). Video, in particular, is difficult to share due to large file sizes. Survae’s cloud solution solves this problem by encoding all video files in web-standard formats and in a variety of sizes -- from 480p to 4k -- enabling shareable links to any media connected to the map. You can also embed Survae’s video/map player on any website or provide clients with private access to their own media where they can view, work with and share all of their content. Unlike other products, which are drone or camera-specific, Survae offers open support for aerial, ground and submarine video and imagery, providing an ideal solution for managing and working with the massive amount of images being recorded by UAVs and ground-based cameras. We are agnostic about the source as long as it’s data-enabled. We work with all kinds devices including UAVs, smartphones, GoPros and Garmins, police dash cams and body cams, surveillance cameras, underwater cameras, helicopter or plane-mounted cameras, plus satellites. Whether you are doing infrastructure inspections, managing conserved land or emergency response, Survae provides all the tools needed to acquire the needed imagery, view it with context, share it, and manage it using a map-based interface. The Survae platform is cloud-based.
