Upon arrival, guest input their dietary desires, including allergies, illnesses, restrictions, and specific needs. A menu is designed for them in seconds and they are able to order their meal in moments. Offering only fresh, quality, and local ingredients. It seems as though everyone is on a diet or has restrictions that limit the foods that they can enjoy. These limitations hinder so many from going out to eat, or having a nice sit down lunch with friends in fear that they have to ask if everything on the menu is gluten free, sugar free, and raised locally. CÜR wants to embrace those limitations and cater to them. When a guest (not a customer) arrives he or she will approach a kiosk where they enter their diet (Paleo, Attkins, Gluten Free, Vegan, Vegetarian, Diabetic, etc), allergies, dislikes, likes, and craving (sweet, salty, light, snack, etc.). The computer will compile a menu for them to choose from. They make their food and drink selection (offering high quality teas, coffees, and natural sodas and juices) and select a here or to-go option. They pay and take a seat at a desired table or booth. Serving items for on the go patrons and dine in fans alike. It will be a chic and classic cafe with little room for human error and providing consistent and sustainable service and food quality. Looking to employ 10-15 employees. Open 6am-4pm Daily and offering brunch specials on Saturday and Sunday.

Our partnership, with combined experience of over 50 years, marries a radio operations/program specialist with a sales & business development specialist.  Todd has worked with small independent & large corporate Radio stations, as well as TV broadcasting & video for 25 years.  Dave has experience selling to Fortune 1000 companies as well as “Mom and Pops”, as well as building sales teams & long-term profitable relationships for 25+ years. This combined experience sets us apart from the average & with the help of owner financing we will successfully build & grow the advertising base, increasing revenues & paying off the debt aggressively.   Due to our limited capital & credit, we would like to make a handsome offer for a company as an incentive to sell their business to us.  We are very open-minded to creative financing & looking for a win-win agreement.  We have found some great opportunities so far but we lack the capital to get started in the form of a 10-20% down payment & operating capital while we establish &/or grow the station based upon the needs of the market. We estimate our capital needs at $250K to 2 Million, based upon the asking price of the station, etc.  We are seeking capital for either the down  payment with owner financing or full purchase, along with operating expenses for approximately 1-2 years.  What we are offering in return is full capital payback with a partial business lifetime equity stake or a negotiated full partner business lifetime equity stake. If this is of serious interest to you, please contact us at 813-803-2203 or by email at ttdcommunications@gmail.com and we’ll be glad to discuss this opportunity further.
