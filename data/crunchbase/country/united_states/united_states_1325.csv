I read on Wikipedia that the Goodyear Zeppelin Corp. built rigid airships in conjunction with Germany until the relationship between the U.S. and Germany deteriorated prior to World War II.  So in 1939 the Goodyear Aircraft Company dissociated itself from Germany and became its own entity.

Avion Energy takes advantage of this opportunity to provide exceptional energy procurement service which finds the best price for the consumer and simplifies energy decisions. In similar fashion to how the insurance, banking, and travel industries were affected by companies like Progressive in 1995, Expedia and Travelocity in 1996, and LendingTree in 1998, Avion Energy seeks to change the dynamic of how energy is procured.  Typically a consumer will contact two or three energy providers and select the one that is currently offering a low, “teaser” rate.  After the introductory offer ends, the rate will increase at a slow but steady pace as energy providers are aware that many consumers rarely reevaluate or change energy providers.  That means the energy provider’s rate steadily increases; or better put, the consumer’s energy bill steadily rises for years.  Avion Energy assists the consumer in an extensive review of applicable energy providers year after year, thereby finding and keeping the consumer in best pricing.   Avion Energy has spent the past five years creating a proof-of-concept system to provide an apple-to-apples comparison of energy rates in all deregulated markets at no direct charge to the consumer.  This proprietary technology places Avion Energy in the forefront of energy procurement.   Avion Energy generates revenue every time one of its clients, an energy consumer, pays his/her electricity and/or natural gas bill.  The client never pays Avion Energy directly.  As is the case with many types of brokers, the seller pays a broker fee or commission.  In the case of energy procurement, the energy provider pays the energy broker based on the usage of the client.","Energy, Natural Resources, Other, Sustainability",1,Joe Mittiga,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Users complete a psychometric/habit/demographic questionnaire using a novel ""slider"" (patent pending), then the app reorders staff- and user-generated plans into what is most likely to work for the user, based on ratings by similar users. These plans increasingly start with short-form videos as those are getting the best engagement.  Initial trials of the app were for university students and oriented towards providing plans to indigenous students, youth with disabilities entering the workforce, and people afflicted by mental health issues. Now, eight new universities are set to come on board to provide our service to foster youth in the United States, Canada, and South Africa.  Universities and colleges have been a great starting place. We are focused on growing in that market and refining our product. In the long run, however, the function of the app opens the possibility for questions and plans to be catered to just about any audience while using the same technology, allowing us to potentially help countless other groups. All it takes is questions and plans (which the AI helps improve over time) and a user base (at least 1,000 users) who want to achieve something. For university students that ""something"" is belonging and academic success. For other trials, we've had interest in rollouts for sales success, job success, mental health, addiction recovery, or being a great parent.","Administrative Services, Education, Health Care, Software",1,Jonny White,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
