Located in the heart of Detroit, MI, close to other Detroit brands such as Faygo® and Better Made®, Happy Howie’s combines all-natural ingredients into a treat all dogs love. Happy Howie’s story begins with that of its hometown. Detroit, once considered one of the most innovative and architecturally appealing cities in the world, fell on hard times with the decline of manufacturing and the American automotive industry. However, over the past decade, residents of Detroit have been proud to welcome new industries of all types and sizes. Whether it is urban farming, the newly created “Tech Town” or even all natural dog treats, Detroit is pleased to be home to a diverse population and even more diverse industries. Having seen the fight in Detroit and the will of its residents, Happy Howie’s thought it was important to be part of the revitalization effort. After acquiring the necessary capital to begin, Happy Howie’s planned two things for the future: to become the preeminent all-natural dog treat in the Midwest and be part of the amazing turn around happening in its hometown. Happy Howie’s wouldn't be here today without its loyal customers, the support of Detroiters and, of course, Howie. Howie represents the willpower and fight found in Detroiters and people everywhere. A border collie rescue from the Humane Society, Howie has defied all odds to live a great life. Howie’s remarkable achievements include not only being the icon for Happy Howie’s, but also the feature on a Humane Society billboard in Jackson, MI, and a loving pet to a marathoner owner. Even after Howie had to have a steel plate inserted into his body, he still enjoys long runs with his best friend. Over the past 6 years, Happy Howie’s has developed from a small, relatively unknown Detroit-based company to one of the best providers of all natural dog treats. From its original one-of-a-kind deli style sausages for dogs, Happy Howie’s has expanded to include burger patties, jerky and other treats that dogs love. Happy Howie’s is proud to serve dogs in nearly 30 states while truly representing the Detroit spirit.","Community and Lifestyle, Food and Beverage",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

EyeTel was started with the idea of using new imaging technologies to address the large, growing and addressable clinical problem of vision loss due to undetected and untreated diabetic retinopathy.  The key tenets of the EyeTel Philosophy were established in those early days and are the foundation of their company: - World class technology that has extensive clinical validation - Along with expert clinical support - For use in the primary care setting to provide better care conveniently for patients - In a cost effective and easy to use way EyeTel worked in collaboration with the scientists from the Wilmer Eye Institute to develop the DigiScope, a semi-automated fundus camera with telemedicine capabilities.  A patent covering the technology was granted and they filed a 510(k) for the DigiScope and received FDA clearance in 1999.  A validation study independent of Wilmer was conducted at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, MI under the direction of Rhett Schiffman, M.D.  The results of the study were published in Ophthalmic Surgery, Lasers and Imaging and demonstrated excellent agreement, sensitivity and specificity compared with the gold standard seven-field color stereo photography for identifying patients with any levels of diabetic retinopathy.  As they grew, they created the EyeTel Reading Center, a world-class telemedicine service providing expert analysis of patient images by highly trained ""readers"".  The Wilmer Eye Institute provides clinical and quality oversight for the EyeTel Reading Center.  They also established a manufacturing agreement with Topzone of Changsha, China to manufacture the DigiScope.  This arrangement allows EyeTel to produce the DigiScope at low cost and provides a scalable source of DigiScope production. After an extensive worldwide search, Eli Lilly a leader in diabetes research, chose EyeTel to collaborate on market development for identifying patients with diabetic retinopathy. By 2007, their development work, with the scientists and clinical experts from Wilmer and with their manufacturing and development partner in China, led to significant enhancements to the capabilities of the EyeTel Retinal Imaging System making it a robust tool to help the Optometric physician detect age-related macular degeneration, optic disc abnormalities such as glaucoma, as well as diabetic retinopathy.  True to their founding principles, the enhanced EyeTel Retinal Imaging System for the optometric practice remains easy to use, cost effective, and has been extensively validated in clinical settings to ensure it's efficacy as a diagnostic tool for the practicing Optometric physician.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",,,11-50,3,M&A,30328000,USD,30328000,30328000,USD,30328000,"Eli Lilly, Bain Capital Ventures, Radius Ventures, Brookside Capital",2,4,,Private,,,,,,

Suspension exercises challenge the mind and muscles (i.e., the neuromuscular system). Each precise movement requires total body awareness, strength and stability across entire chains of muscles (i.e., myofascial chains). When performed with bungee assistance, these exercises become a gentle yet powerful way to restore neuromuscular control and pain-free motion for optimal movement health and pelvic health. Suspension based physical therapy gets faster results than conventional PT and strength training. The difference is felt at a neuromuscular level.

The idea of Wooji occurred to me when I was in Japan during October of 2016. At the time, I was roughly half a year into Button Mash Ninja—my first real business selling anime and gaming inspired parody shirts. Although their designs were well-received in the community as fan art, it didn't feel right using characters I did not create on my own. I knew I wanted to rebrand, but I didn't know which direction to take it in. While I was traveling through Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo, I decided to pick up photography (on my iPhone lol). As I was learning how to improve my shots, I quickly became obsessed with capturing emotion in a still frame. Each place I discovered had a unique story to offer, and I wanted others to understand exactly what I was feeling in that moment, as I stood there behind my camera. That was when I realized I could apply the same storytelling aspect to apparel.","Clothing and Apparel, Commerce and Shopping, Design",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
