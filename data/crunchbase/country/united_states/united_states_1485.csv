The Foundation continues the legacy of Tom and Jean Yawkey by quietly and consciously giving back to organizations in these areas of giving, which the Yawkeys were dedicated to in their lifetimes. Furthermore, the Yawkey Foundation supports the communities that the Yawkeys once called home, including Boston, Massachusetts and Georgetown County, South Carolina. The Yawkey Foundation was established in 1977 by Tom Yawkey in his will to continue the preservation of 20,000 acres of land in South Carolina now known as the Tom Yawkey Wildlife Center. Mr. Yawkey donated the land to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, and the Foundation was intended, in part, to fund the maintenance of the property in perpetuity. After Mr. Yawkey passed in 1976, Mrs. Yawkey continued caring for the causes she and her husband cherished and expanded the land in South Carolina to 24,000 acres. Mrs. Yawkey also furthered the scope of the Foundation to formally include more of the areas of giving mentioned above that she and Mr. Yawkey regularly supported. Some of the Foundation’s partners that fit into the areas of giving include the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Georgetown Memorial Hospital, The Jimmy Fund, National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, Jackie Robinson Foundation, and Boys & Girls Clubs of Boston, to name just a few. The Yawkey Scholars Program has also provided millions of dollars in four-year scholarships to underserved college students. The Foundation Trustees are proud to continue the work of Tom and Jean Yawkey by supporting the aforementioned organizations and more that positively impact the quality of life for families, children, and underserved communities. Since its founding, the Yawkey Foundation has awarded more than $530 million to non-profits in Boston, Massachusetts and Georgetown County, South Carolina.","Other, Social Impact",2,"Jean Yawkey, Tom Yawkey",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Hugh and Connie Carithers, continues to build on its long tradition of providing excellent care for children in Northeast Florida. Both Dr. Hugh and Dr. Connie were instrumental in improving the standards in the field of pediatrics on the state and national level. Dr. Ray Edwards was the Carithers’ first partner and initiated a poison control center in our area. After Dr. Edwards’ death, Dr. Robert Threlkel from Vanderbilt University joined the Carithers in 1971. He followed their example of assuming leadership roles in both local and national pediatrics. Jacksonville native, Robert Colyer, was a patient of Dr. Hugh as a child. Following his education and a pediatric residency at Vanderbilt, Dr. Colyer returned to Jacksonville in 1977 and became a member of the group. Dr. Julie Baker joined the practice in 1983, from the University of Alabama at Birmingham program and both she and Dr. Colyer were quick to enter into leadership in both local, state and community medical organizations. The members of The Carithers Pediatric Group believe in sharing their gifts, education and experience with the larger community and encourage the physicians on their staff to follow their example. The practice grew through the years to include Dr. Paul Robinson in 1988 and Dr. James Cheek in 1990, both of whom trained at Vanderbilt. As Jacksonville grew so did the number of our physicians. Dr. Wendy Sapolsky joined the group in 1995 from Wake Forest, Dr. Kim Dal Porto and Dr. Raoul Sanchez joined in 1997 from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Dr. Amy Hardman joined in 1998 from Vanderbilt, Dr. Thomas Connolly joined in 2002 from the United States Air Force, Dr. Anne Egan joined in 2003 from a practice in Pittsburgh, Dr. Andreae Shaw joined in 2009 from the University of Florida, and Dr. Chanley Dudley joined in 2013 from Massachusetts General Hospital. Several of the doctors in the practice share the commonality of being patients as children or having strong roots in Jacksonville. Leah Copham, Meg Cheney, and Katie Mershon, all former patients, were our first pediatric nurse practitioners. Trudy English joined our group of nurse practitioners in 2010, Cari Trappe and Lindsay Wolf joined in 2012 and Gianna Agustin joined in 2013. In 1999, the Physicians formally named the practice, “The Carithers Pediatric Group” in honor of the legacy of Dr. Hugh and Dr. Connie and their hard work for the children of Jacksonville. At The Carithers Pediatric Group, we strive for excellence as physicians and staff and participate in efforts to make a healthier community. In return we have seen the larger community of Jacksonville and Northeast Florida express an appreciation for our work and service. Our group is not only about quality care for our patients, but medical leadership for our area. It’s all about giving back!","Community and Lifestyle, Health Care",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
