Who We Are With 90+ combined years of legal experience, GED has provided litigation services comprised of Business & Real Estate matters, Employment representation, Landlord-Tenant resolution, and Criminal Defense. GED also specializes in Strategic Counseling for Employer mitigation and investigation, along with counseling individuals and businesses in the resolution of Government & Administrative matters. How We Work From the beginning, we at GED have always put efficiency at the forefront, utilizing best-practices to build our reputation for setting precedent in the legal field while getting from point A to point Z in less time. “Effective preparation is beneficial to our clients,” says GED partner, Jim Dawson. “They greatly appreciate the fact that we have their matter(s) resolved by negotiation, arbitration, or brought to trial quicker than most law firms.” This process has become a science within the firm. Partner Marc Eisenhart elaborates, “We are not interested in working and billing hours just for the sake of billing hours. Every moment taken with the case, through research, conversations, and brainstorming with the other partners, are all ingredients used to win the case for the client. And we do win.” The GED science involves a team approach where we believe that two or four heads are better than one. When a client works with one of us, they actually receive the expertise and experience from all of us behind the scenes. Why We Practice Law In the end, it is those relationships with the people we help that bring the highest level of satisfaction in practicing law and providing our litigation services. As Nick Emanuel, Criminal Defense attorney for GED puts it while reflecting on a “Thank You” card he received from one grateful client, “Everyday when I look at that card I am reminded of how lucky I am to have an occupation where if I do my job well I can have a profound effect on people.”",Professional Services,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
