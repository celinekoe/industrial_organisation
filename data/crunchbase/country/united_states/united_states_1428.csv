It is capable of providing many times the levels of total energy demand. It is time for scientists, working in every level of the energy industry, to consider this fact in their designs; time for investors to support research and development in other aspects of solar energy. I foresee in the very near future, there will be an index for average energy consumption for any commercial and residential building. This index will be a factor in the price and value of property ownership or occupancy.     Their future goal and concentration is also on running car engines using renewable energy soley, or in conjunction, with other energy sources like gas, electrical, etc. Also converting the energy, created and lost within the engine cavity, to be used as a source of energy in and of itself.   At present, the world population has reached seven billion; an increase of one billion people in ten years. The world's population is expected to grow to nine billion by 2050.

How are businesses going to broadcast music to visitors of their virtual storefronts across various metaverses? How will they ensure that they provide their users with the most dynamic and engaging experience possible? How is the music industry going to find and engage with new fans in virtual spaces? We are building our Koreo platform to help address these challenges. The Koreo platform combines a music broadcasting and performance tracking solution with a proprietary development tool that developers can leverage to connect visualizations and simulations directly to the music. These features combine to enable rich, emotionally resonant experiences for multiverse users and players. The tracking solutions provide developers and the music industry with user engagement metrics and insights. The metaverse itself is developing from video game technology. Roblox, Minecraft, and Epic's Fortnite are three of the biggest names in the metaverse space, with a combined user base of 440M active monthly users. Bringing music to the metaverse will mean providing a solution to these and other platforms and this is where Sonic Bloom excels. Sonic Bloom's founders are music video game development veterans. They have worked on titles including Guitar Hero, Rock Band, Lips, Dance Central, and The Black Eyed Peas Experience. Their first product, Koreographer, is a music integration tool that has helped thousands of game developers create engaging music-driven experiences.
