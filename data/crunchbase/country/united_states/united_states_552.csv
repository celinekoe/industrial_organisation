Our proprietary technology enables access to on-site, self-service electricity via industry standard charging stations and in-wall outlets for customers who initiate service with their mobile phones. MARKETS WE SERVE Powering the mobile food industry There are over 25,000 food carts and food trucks in the United States. This is a rapidly expanding space, and the food truck rodeo phenomena is rapidly spreading to cities throughout the country. Their legacy source of energy, gas or diesel powered generators, is both expensive for the vendors as well as a pollution and noise nuisance. Our solution enables private lot managers and municipalities to provide electricity to these vendors who can meet their energy needs at a significant cost savings while providing a better environment for everyone. Idle reduction for public service, delivery, and fleet vehicles Engine idling is a major problem for smog, urban air pollution, and greenhouse gases, especially in large diesel engines. According to the EPA, long-duration idling of truck and locomotive engines consumes over 1 billion US gallons of diesel fuel and emits 11 million tons of carbon dioxide, 200,000 tons of oxides of nitrogen, and 5,000 tons of particulate matter into the air each year. Our solution enables vehicles such as ambulances and delivery trucks to connect to the grid for energy to power their equipment or refrigeration units rather than idling their engines. Managing electricity access at marinas and RV parks There are more than 8,000 marinas and 13,000 RV parks in the United States. Many of these facilities either have no capability for the automated provisioning, management, and billing of electric service, or they have a legacy RFID card system which leaves customers unable to check their usage and presents proprietors with a myriad of operational challenges and customer support issues. Our solution provides both a metering and control capability to these locations which can enhance their revenue generation from electric service and streamline their operations.",Energy,2,"Jeffrey Hoffman, Michael Dubrovsky",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Sifteo makes Sifteo cubes, a tactile interactive game system for hands-on fun and Intelligent Play, and a growing number of games exclusive to its platform. Sifteo is also a publisher of games for its platform, and runs regular game jams using its freely-available SDK for developers around the country. Sifteo cubes is a next generation game system consisting of physical blocks with full-color graphics that sense each other and their motion. The system offers a new type of interface that allows computer interactions to be more direct and physical in nature: a hands-on computer the size and shape of a building block. Gesture-detection technology makes interactive play with Sifteo cubes natural and allows players to shake, flip, tilt, press, and neighbor Sifteo cubes to control the action. Sifteo began as a collaboration between co-founders Dave Merrill and Jeevan Kalanithi at the MIT Media Lab. They wanted to re-think human-computer interaction by designing new, physical interfaces. One afternoon they sat around a table in the lab’s kitchen and imagined sorting through a pile of digital data as if it were a pile of LEGOs. The idea for Sifteo cubes was born. Several generations of prototypes later, Dave was invited to share their early work by giving a presentation on the main stage at the TED conference in 2009 - and the talk went viral. This public enthusiasm galvanized the pair to found Sifteo Inc., and four months later Dave and Jeevan were at work in San Francisco building a company.  Sifteo games embody Intelligent Play, combining classic tactile play patterns and social aspects of activities like chess and building blocks with the richness of interactive game technology. The Sifteo game library includes challenging games for adults, fun learning puzzles for kids, and games families can play together.","Gaming, Hardware, Science and Engineering, Software",2,"David Merrill, Jeevan Kalanithi",11-50,4,M&A,13000000,USD,13000000,13500000,USD,13500000,"National Science Foundation, True Ventures, MIT Media Lab, Foundry Group, MIT Venture Mentoring Service (MIT VMS)",2,5,,Private,,,,,,
