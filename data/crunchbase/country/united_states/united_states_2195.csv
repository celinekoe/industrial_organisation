So my name is Yaroslav Merkulov. On June 7th, 2015 I will begin my professional golf career playing on the SwingThought.com Tour and the eGolf Tour. I played collegiate golf as a member of the Duke University varsity men's golf team. However, I spent a year away from golf pursuing other opportunities in life. I went back to Duke to get my Master's in Management Studies through the Fuqua school of Business. However, over the course of the past year i began to realize that my heart and passion is with Golf. Upon graduation, i had several job offers and i subsequently turned them down to pursue competitive professional golf. At one point in my career I was considered one of the best up and coming golfers in the United States. I had a rather lackluster collegiate career, however my desire and drive for golf has been reborn.   I already have a deal with Titleist as part of their postgraduate players sponsorship. this sponsorship requires i compete in 20 professional events per year for a two year period. This leaves me with needing some funds to cover entry fees and some living expenses. In order to comply with Titleist's requests, I need to raise $50,000. I have already estimated all foreseeable costs and this dollar amount will allow me to comfortably pursue my career.   Furthermore, as long as the donations are not anonymous, I will be offering to payback 10% of my winnings per share as a dividend.","Commerce and Shopping, Education, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Sports",,,1-10,1,,5000,USD,5000,5000,USD,5000,,,,,Private,,,,,,
