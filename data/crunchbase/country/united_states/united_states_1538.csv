Guests scroll restaurant menus, customize an order, modify any item, add people to a group order, split the check, choose delivery or carryout, and with the push of a button, have an order in their hands. ASAP has transformed the way restaurants reach people & the way people choose restaurants. The ASAP delivery team & on-demand delivery platform differentiates itself from the pack by being built by hospitality professionals for hospitality professionals. ASAP (formerly known as Waitr) began in late 2013 and started in Chris Meaux's home office and moved into the SEED Center, a Lake Charles, Louisiana business incubator near McNeese State University's campus on Ryan Street. In late 2015, by the end of the first year of operations, 57,000 food delivery orders had been placed on the Waitr app. That was when the decision was made by then CEO Chris Meaux to begin to amp up the digital marketing & operations efforts in addition to the engineering and administrative efforts to guide the company. In marketing, Patrick Hardey was added to the team to take over founder Addison Killebrew's marketing role alongside Katie Davis & Chloe Friend. For operations, Matt Sarradet, Charity Grandchampt, and Crystal Day were hired. As they grew quickly, several months into 2016 their first acquisition took place when they bought GoGoGrocer and then a competitor called Requested out of Northern California founded by San Francisco's Jeff Bolante, & Sacramento's Sonny Mayugba, two seasoned marketing veterans who dropped out of Facebook's Global Marketing Team responsible for developing and growing the Facebook Blueprint. With Sonny Mayugba and Jeff Bolante at the helm in combination with an already successful marketing effort they were able to mentor Patrick Hardey into becoming a customer acquisition professional on Facebook rapidly, which was alluded to by CEO Chris Meaux in a 2017 YouTube video. Some time later Patrick Hardey spearheaded an internal business unit embedded in the marketing department called Partner Marketing (premium digital marketing service), and also cofounded  the Waitr Impact corporate social responsibility program after a pitch to executives and board members, and afterward was invited to join the operations stewardship council. Subsequently, through their teamwork with operations, HR, sales, and service they posted a 20%+ month-to-month growth rate average for roughly 3 consecutive years before going public through a strategic partner in the world's wealthiest restauranteur who was impressed with their ability to bring in and keep customers happy on the B2B and B2C fronts. Through a SPAC led by Tilman Fertitta (who is the Billion Dollar Buyer (CNBC), owner of Landry's, the Houston Rockets (NBA), and the entire Golden Nugget casino resort franchise) they exited onto the Nasdaq in November 2018 at $308M, Louisiana history's largest tech exit valuation, and the world's second publicly traded food delivery company beating Uber to the public markets.","Apps, Food and Beverage, Mobile, Software, Transportation",9,"Addison Killebrew, Charity Grandchampt, Chris Meaux, Evan Diaz De Arce, Jeff Bolante, Manuel Rivero, Matt Sarradet, Patrick Hardey, Sonny Mayugba",501-1000,3,M&A,14000000,USD,14000000,24000000,USD,24000000,"Innovation Catalyst, Drew Brees",2,2,4,Public,2018-11-28,,,WTRH,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/waitr-ipo--b4d9c08a,NASDAQ

But, why? Because the government won’t fix it, and big corporations won’t fix it, and $1 donations at checkout won’t fix it. So we chose to arm the people to fix it. We’re doing it by empowering millions of everyday people, stay at home moms, college students, and small entrepreneurs, to fix it. We are providing them with the technology and capital needed to save more than $200 Billion worth of used goods from being thrown into landfills every year and flipping this waste into profit. Turning it into cash, creating jobs, and flourishing an economy of people-owned sustainable businesses. The technology we’re building at Flyp: Flyp developed two core products aimed at empowering an army of stay at home resellers to effectively resell and monetize millions of items that would have ended up in landfill otherwise: 1) AI driven platform to monetize used clothes: Flyp developed the first and only platform that allows individual consumers and businesses to offload their pre owned items to online resellers who will sell it for them on marketplace like eBay, Poshmark, Facebook and others for a commission. Think of Thredup or TheRealReal, but instead of a centralized company doing the selling, it’s done by a network of thousands of small, stay-at-home online resellers. The key to this platform is Flyp’s AI-enabled matching technology which uses Pro Seller’s historical sales data to algorithmically match inventory with the Pro Seller who is the best fit to resell it. This unprecedented matchmaking has already succeeded in moving over 160 metric tons worth millions of dollars that would have ended in landfills, and is growing quickly at a 400% annual growth rate. 2) Automation platform to give small sellers the power of big retailers: In order to process millions of items successfully, Flyp had to invest in empowering the network of individual resellers by bringing to them the workflow automation capabilities that had only been available to big e-commerce players at exorbitant prices. This is why Flyp developed a fully free automation suite that saves resellers 90% of the time they used to put into inventory management and sales management across channels. This suite of tools has succeeded in becoming the new operating system for resellers, so much so that 85% of its users are daily active users making thousands of sales a day on auto-pilot. The impact of Flyp: Flyp’s impact is not a virtue signaling side effect, Flyp’s impact is fully visible and tangible in every transaction that occurs on the platform: 1) Environmental impact: With the fashion industry’s landfill waste contributing to more than 10% of global carbon emissions, being able to save millions of items from ending up in landfills and recirculating them in the market is Flyp’s core business model and impact lever at the same time. 2) Social and economic impact: While most are used to environmentally friendly alternatives being more costly than the polluting ones, Flyp has actually always held the belief that “sustainability can pay back in cash”. And on our mission to save the environment, we are creating and supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs for small stay-at-home entrepreneurs around the country, enabling them to generate millions of dollars in income and allowing them to sustain themselves and their families and creating a massive amount of new jobs in sustainability. We are also providing millions of shoppers with affordable items at a massive discount from retail, and allowing them to participate in the circular economy and reducing their own carbon footprint all while making very tangible economic savings. Flyp’s vision for the future and why it matters: At Flyp, we believe that one of the biggest hidden problems we face as a consumerist society is the immense waste generated from our purchases. This enormous waste is not only catastrophic to the environment, but it also represents a completely wasted economic value that is robbing consumers and businesses alike from recuperating sizable portions of the cost of the goods they had already paid for, simply due to a failure in logistics. The future we’re already creating at Flyp is one where all this massive waste, is turned into prosperous jobs for hundreds of thousands of small stay-at-home entrepreneurs, who in the process of reselling what would otherwise have gone to landfills, will create a massive circular economic cycle benefiting consumers, businesses and the environment.","Commerce and Shopping, Other, Sustainability",2,"Dani Arnaout, James Kawas",11-50,4,Early Stage Venture,14250000,USD,14250000,14250000,USD,14250000,"Gaingels, 2048 Ventures, 1517 Fund, Afore Capital, BAM Ventures",3,12,,Private,,,,,,
