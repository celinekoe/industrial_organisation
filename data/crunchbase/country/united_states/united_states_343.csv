A different kind of solution for the real-world needs of discrete manufacturers, L2L includes 5 modules: L2L Dispatch, L2L Maintenance, L2L Production, L2L Connect and L2L Studio. L2L Dispatch is a revolutionary abnormality management and work execution software that helps manufacturers optimize facilities across people, processes, materials and machines in real time. It unifies all shop floor departments to identify and solve problems at the root cause, enabling management to quickly create a problem-solving culture. Unlike traditional CMMS/EAM software that focuses strictly on machine maintenance and availability, L2L Maintenance utilizes a broader data set to align maintenance and production schedules in a way that dramatically increases operational efficiency. Because it’s tied to the Dispatch execution software, L2L lets manufacturers implement condition-based and predictive maintenance programs in weeks instead of years. Unlike traditional MES offerings that focus on process control and traceability, L2L Production pairs production data with maintenance data to connect and orchestrate teams across the plant floor, and lets management visualize production performance and automate resolution workflows that maximize team efficiency. L2L Connect brings machine and systems data into L2L Dispatch, allowing for predictive maintenance and alert triggering to prevent disruptive shop floor events.  L2L Studio is a no-code app creation module that facilitates in-app custom workflows for shop floor workers.  L2L’s platform is 100% cloud-based and mobile-ready, and the no-code deployment process is completed within 50 days on average, for unmatched speed to value.","Manufacturing, Software",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

"OcuMedic, Inc.",https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ocumedic-inc,"Biotechnology, Health Care, Medical","Mullica Hill, New Jersey, United States",OcuMedic is a drug delivery & medical device company that develops therapeutic contact lenses.,"110,343","Greater Philadelphia Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",,Active,2006-05-01,day,,,,,For Profit,http://ocumedic.net,"OcuMedic’s technology:  Timed Drug Delivery to the Eye via a Contact Lens/Clear Corneal Bandage with 7 Day wear.The technology rests on 10 issued patents, and a recent Freedom to Operate (FTO) opinion. Efficacy has been proven in an animal model. The intellectual property teaches a novel therapeutic contact lens with memory capable of controlled release of first line ophthalmic agents, both anti-inflammatory and antibiotic. The technology has been developed for the most common and widely used contact lens material silicon hydrogel, (SiHy). The technology is also a platform technology and has been tested for a wide range of ten (10)  other drugs as well as molecules to enhance lens comfort and treat dry eye.  Controlled release from contact lenses has been the subject of discussions and investigation for fifty, (50) years as eye doctors attempted to soak lens in drugs gaining negligible   therapeutic effect.  Previous engineered   methods suffer from either poor control of the release profile   or   inadequate drug loading with the overwhelming majority of researchers demonstrating both problems. Thus, there are no products on the market today. With the OcuMedic’s method   memory for the drug is produced during polymer synthesis where monomers are complexed non-covalently to the drug and crosslinked into a hydrogel matrix. Upon removal of the drug, macromolecular memory sites remain within the hydrogel with affinity for the drug. The drug’s heightened interaction with these memory pockets enhances its loading and SLOWS its transport within the hydrogel despite comparable free volume of drug transport. It has been shown that the extension of release has a strong dependence on mimicking biological recognition in the design exploiting the chemical diversity and amounts of monomers in relation to the drug. Thus, OcuMedic can literally…. DIAL IN THE RELEASE OF DRUG FROM THE LENS OVER TIME delivering a therapeutic concentration of drug payload for the duration of wear.Key Milestones: The biggest hurdle and Key Milestone has been the development of the enabling break thru technology on how to control the sustained kinetics of drug release in a SiHy lens for duration of wear AND maintain other lens properties such as; modulus, optical clarity, thickness, and oxygen diffusivity. OcuMedic’s patented technology creates a new architecture with memory for the drug within the polymeric network comprising the contact lens to enable continuous, controlled, release of the drug to the eye. The non-obvious proprietary solution was the development of the macromolecular memory   release concept utilizing and optimizing interactions between the drug and chemistry within the lens via multiple polymer chains within the network structure. Second, securing the World-Wide license from Auburn University 18 months ago which include 9 Granted Patents and now 10 with the recent European grant.   The OcuMedic’s Market & Solution:   Currently topical eye drops wash out quickly with only ~5% of the drug getting to the desired site. Most eye drop therapeutic regimens require multiple drops per day and most patients miss their doses which leads to complication costing   $70 billion per year. The OcuMedic’s solution is continuous dosing using contact lens with visual correction or a clear contact bandage providing more efficacious and convenient therapy DECREASING COMPLICATIONS and reducing HEALTH CARE COSTS.   Currently Optometrists in the US   are enabled as physicians under Medicare and under state licensure dispense diagnostic and therapeutic agents. With the advent of “co-management” of patients undergoing cataract surgery (4million procedure/year) or Lasik (800K procedures/year) and post-corneal abrasions (1million/year) the Optometrist along with the  19,000 Surgical Ophthalmologist are ideally suited to deliver OcuMedic’s therapy both by license and as the prevailing optometric contact lens fitters that hold inventory in their practices in the case of the 33,000 US Optometrists.. OcuMedic’s technology will provide clinicians a powerful, new tool to treat patients. Use of Funds: The laboratory porotypes lens is complete with in-vivo data that supports efficacy. The next stage in the development are Pre-clinical studies in order to navigate the FDA as further bench  animal studies are planned to validate SAFETY. The timing is thirteen (13) months costing $1.5M. This development is planned to stage OcuMedic for the 1-2 multi - site human clinical trials to further validate safety and assess efficacy and bioequivalence requiring 30 months costing $2.5M. There is a potential for multiple EXIT points along the development path each with a higher valuation. Management believes the Series A could be the last money in the company with an EXIT at Phase 1-2 or 2 based on recent take outs at this level with proof of efficacy in humans.

Finding skilled workers was quickly identified as one of the top challenges for our manufacturers.  Promoting rewarding careers in manufacturing became the core mission of the organization. In 2012, the AWT Foundation became a 501-(c)3 non-profit. Since then, the AWT Foundation now has 500+ manufacturing company, community organization, and school members.  The AWT Foundation is hard at work to change the overall perception of manufacturing. The group realizes the need for educators, counselors, parents and others to understand the importance of manufacturing as a viable career path. As manufacturing continues to grow fast in Northeast Ohio and the future looks promising, there is still a critical shortage of skilled workers to satisfy growing demand and replace baby-boomers who are approaching retirement. This is going to create a huge hole for employers in the manufacturing/machine trades industry unless future generations enter the field. With the help of our strategic partners, the AWT Foundation has developed several Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)-to-career educational programs. Through these educational and career-centered programs, the AWT Foundation has placed more than 1,000+ students into manufacturing careers and helped over 300 5th and 6th grade students learn about and experience manufacturing careers in local communities. We have facilitated over 1,200 student, teacher, and parent tours of manufacturing facilities.

Contractors, third party haulers and DOT members work together using BroadLoop for dispatching, E-Ticketing, cycle time analysis, field process efficiency and more. In 2021, the Federal Highway Administrator included E-Tickets in their Every Day Counts - 6 initiative to help drive efficiency throughout the industry. E-Ticketing is more than just digitization or ""going paperless"". BroadLoop participated in the steering committee with AASHTO to help define the consistent requirements around data transfer, formatting and process for transmitting digital load ticket details. Data can now be accessed in realtime with higher accuracy which eliminates a great deal of manual intervention, delays and expense.  Asphalt Contractors rely on third party dump trucks to haul the material they produce at the plant to the jobsite where the crew is waiting for it. Because they do not own these assets, they operate at a disadvantage due to the lack of visibility over this virtual fleet. When there are no trucks to provide material to the paving crew, they sit idle which costs the contractor $1,000/hr and leads to a $1B loss across the industry every year in the US. BroadLoop helps the contractors avoid that loss, maximize the use of the fleet they are already paying for and delivers a competitive advantage in a space where margins are already thin and bids are competitive.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Information Technology, Internet Services, Other, Real Estate, Software, Transportation",1,Nick McRae,1-10,3,Seed,470000,USD,470000,495000,USD,495000,"Techstars, The Vogt Awards",2,2,,Private,,,,,,
