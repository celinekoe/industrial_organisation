Wanting to have more control over the outcome of their investments and see them up close eventually caused them to move away from the stock market and focus more on real estate as investors and lenders. After a few years as real estate lenders and brokers, they decided to focus on the service side of the industry. By 2010, Del Toro was providing document preparation and loan servicing to over 1,000 people, causing business to grow over 20% annually since that time. The reason for the steady growth was due to both the quality of Del Toro clients and the passionate and professional staff. Del Toro has a culture that revolves around constant personal and professional development. While others claim to be great, Del Toro promises to be different.
