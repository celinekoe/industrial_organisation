What started out as my family's search for natural and effective products to address their struggles with dry and eczema prone skin, led us to create a line to truly natural and luxurious hair and body care products, using shea butter as the key ingredient. Their quest led us back to West Africa, where the shea trees grow and they found more than a solution to dry skin. Shea butter has been used for centuries in Africa for food and beauty. The shea fruit fall from the tree and is handpicked by African women. In West Africa, Shea butter is called Women's Gold because the proceeds from processing shea nuts into butter is money women get to keep for themselves. Women use these funds to pay school fees, clothe and provide medicine for their children. Women have a universal need to feel empowered to take care of their families and the women in Africa are no different. They have partnered with women shea producers to source the shea butter they use in their premium line of products. These women also share their insights and wisdom on the uses of shea butter and this inspires us to create more innovative products based on their traditional wisdom. What makes Shea Radiance products truly special is the higher amount of shea butter they use in their formulations. The higher percentage makes the products effective and gives their customers the desired results for their hair and skin. Over 8 years of experience formulating with natural ingredients allows us to combine the best of nature and science.  They believe that exceptional ingredients deliver maximum performance. The high percentage of shea butter in their products also means that they purchase more shea butter which brings more money to women and their communities. They believe that when you empower a woman, you strengthen a family and transform a community, and that is how a really great jar of cream can change the world.","Commerce and Shopping, Data and Analytics, Design, Other",2,"Funlayo Alabi, Shola Alabi",11-50,2,Seed,25000,USD,25000,25000,USD,25000,"The Motley Fool, Conscious Venture Lab",,2,,Private,,,,,,
