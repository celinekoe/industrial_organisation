With the help of the CAH's team of researches and the lab's generous investment, we have designed SpendPal to leverage concepts such as choice architecture, mental framing and others to create a banking environment that helps people naturally make better decisions with their money. Here's how it works:  Instead of viewing your money all lumped together in a single checking account, SpendPal shows the money you have on deposit, divided into Categories that are meaningful to you. When you open the SpendPal app on your phone and select a Category for spending, your next purchase is automatically deducted from that category as soon as you swipe your card.  Backup Categories are one of SpendPals best features. Backup Categories are displayed directly below the Category you selected for spending and show you exactly what Category (or Categories) money will be stolen from if you overspend.  For example, if you select your Clothing category and see you don't have enough money to buy a new pair of shoes, you might also see that if you buy the shoes anyway, the money to complete the purchase would be stolen from your daughter’s birthday category.  Seeing something important you'd have to give up helps you avoid overspending on things you'd regret and helps you save more money for the things that really matter most to you.

This network expansion has created virgin territories where there is little competition for prepaid wireless services. Progressive Wireless was formed to open 100 Cricket Wireless stores as quickly as possible. Cricket's dealer program provides excellent activation commissions, lifetime residuals and great margins on accessories.   There is a reason that 90-95% of franchises succeed. They are based on a long track record of success. There are currently over 3,300 Cricket stores in the U.S. and the parent company was started 15 years ago. As a Cricket dealer, we benefit from many franchise characteristics such as training programs, strong brand and corporate marketing assistance, increased purchasing power, operational support, location and construction assistance etc. Best of all Cricket does not charge a franchise fee.   The Company's President was recruited by Cricket Wireless after recently selling his exceptionally run 34-store Sprint dealership. He has an MBA and over 16 years of experience in the wireless industry. Between the officers and board members, the team has over 40 years combined experience in the wireless industry and over a century of business management experience.   The prepaid wireless market segment is large and growing. In the first quarter of 2013 new wireless customers chose prepaid plans 10 to 1 over contract plans. As of 2012 there were 100 million prepaid subscriptions in the U.S. Smartphone sales on prepaid networks doubled from 2012 to 2013 with nearly one third of all smart phones currently on prepaid plans.   Projections show a 47% average annual cash return over 5 yrs with nearly a 500% ROI assuming a sale or IPO in the fifth year. We are selling 20% of the company for $25k minimum investment. 15 founders units available.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Mobile",1,Steve Miller,11-50,2,Seed,425000,USD,425000,425000,USD,425000,,,,,Private,,,,,,
