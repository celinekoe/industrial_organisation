The result will be better individual and public health, and greater financial security for families, businesses and the nation. Their coalitions represent a diverse, nonpartisan group of more than 1,000 grassroots organizations, ranging from restaurant owners to restaurant workers, faith leaders to public health professionals, think tanks to activists for children, seniors and those with disabilities. Family Values @ Work coalitions are active in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Washington, D.C., and Wisconsin. Formed in 2003, Family Values @ Work coalitions are winning.
