The company reaches these consumers through wholesale operations and, on a smaller scale, through direct consumer sales on the company’s website. While more alpaca-based products have appeared on the market in recent years, Woop!Wear maintains a competitive edge because it uses a higher percentage of alpaca in its blends and because it offers lightweight active wear.","Clothing and Apparel, Commerce and Shopping, Consumer Electronics, Design, Hardware, Sports",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
