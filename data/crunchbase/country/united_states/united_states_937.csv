Family Offices, in ever increasing numbers, leverage their entrepreneurial DNA in the pursuit of direct investments. Offices struggle to review proposed investments due to a lack of trust, experience, staff, and/or time. The challenges, associated with the rise in direct investments, encourage a desire for co- investment with like-minded entities. A misalignment in values and horizons, alongside an environment of high fees, drives family offices from traditional investments in public equities and fund structures. High standards with regards to privacy, discretion, and security further limit potential strategic partners. We believe that the best long-term partner for family offices are other family offices. Uniquely capable of leveraging their significant shared expertise, capital, and influence, inter-family office partnerships provide an attractive alternative to traditional fund managers by operating with greater control and flexibility without facing limiting time horizons, high fees, and regulatory restrictions. The opportunity for cross-collaboration often presents itself beyond the traditional realm of capital allocation.","Community and Lifestyle, Financial Services",1,Michael Calvo Elhauge,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Founded in 1987 by Charles “Chip” McCreary, who was Badge #1 at Christian and Timbers (now CTPartners), the firm focuses exclusively at the executive suite (VP level through CEO and Board of Directors) and employs a “Partner in Execution” search methodology that has produced 99+% success over the past 25 years. They have worked in all industries and through all stages of companies - from startup through multi-billion in revenues - but their “sweet spot” over the past 10 years has been in the Technology and Manufacturing/Industrial/Business Services sectors. In the Tech industry, the majority of their clients have been venture capital or private equity backed, and have been startup through IPO/$100M’s in revenues. On the Industrial side, again, all have been primarily VC or PE backed enterprises. Their scope is international and they have successfully completed retained executive search assignments in all theaters worldwide. The Firm is led by Partners who actually “do the work” versus the industry which typically employs a Partner and Associate “split the work” model. Their clients tell us that the Partner executed model works best since all of their business is repeat and/or word of mouth. Unlike the Industry, they have no members of their firm who are business development focused resources. The Firm is led by their 3 Managing Partners: Stephen Sterett, Paul Bailey, and Logan Moodley. They have 60 plus years of retained executive search experience combined between them, and were recruited to the Firm by their Founder.
