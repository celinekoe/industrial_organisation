FLOAT takes the concept of a community corkboard and brings that experience to the Internet. Users can post content to various geographically organized boards, which can be ads, memes, music, movies and more, and users can move, cover and take down this content just like on a real board. The only exception to this are paid ads that are pinned to the board for a specific length of time. The entire network is cloud based and sharing content is legal by having protected content “float” to each user and only one end user has access to the owned content. The more users that own the same content increases the number of users that can share that content. Each user has a personal board that they can use to post content to for their friends to enjoy and also their friends can post content on these boards as well. Sound boards are a great way for users to share music! The possibilities are limitless. The main difference that sets FLOAT apart from every other social media platform is that the space that is used is limited by the amount that the user can scroll left and right and up and down. The prime space is of course what shows up on the screen when the user enters the site.

The business began operations in July of 2013. Mobile Scripts primary focus was delivering prescriptions under contract for one major Pharmacy chain to their customers, as well as front end store products to pharmacy store customers.   From July 2013 until November 2014, the company grew from 11 stores at inception, to 66 stores efficiently and effectively with minimal capital and personnel to provide for this growth. After 3 months of operations, Mobile Scripts was profitable and able to pay all expenses from gross profit. With additional capital funding, the company can be a dominant player within the same day in an hour or more delivery marketplace.  Their most valuable contribution to the marketplace is having the ability to """"pick-up"""" and deliver orders in volume from order creation to delivery to end consuming customers within one hour or more depending on what the customer is willing to pay for. This can be accomplished through the capabilities and functionality of their delivery management system, and effective capitalization and utilization of trained and efficient delivery personnel.   When operations solidify in the US market, additional market opportunities globally for all companies under The Delivery Store, Inc. umbrella will catapult company as the global leader for same-day delivery solutions.   Other retail markets including general retail, restaurant, and heavy item and commercial delivery will provide for 92+% for all same day delivery throughout the US. The potential is enormous!
