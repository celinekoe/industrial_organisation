CardSpur,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cardspur,"Coupons, E-Commerce, Gift Card, Retail","Frisco, Texas, United States",Unlocking the value of unredeemed gift cards,"959,855","Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, Southern US",$1M to $10M,Active,2013-12-01,day,,,,,For Profit,http://CardSpur.com,"Consumers struggle to use gift cards to get meaningful gifts and often the cards go unused ($100B issued each year and 30% are not redeemed).  Retailers want people to use the cards more often. Why? Because, on average, consumers spend ~17% more than the card balance when making purchases. Likewise, consumers convert at a much higher rate online when offers and coupons are available. Combining offers with gift cards give the consumers and the retailers more value in a much more likely transaction. Revenue is generated from commissions on sales. The impact of CardSpur is two-sided. Consumers often leave gift cards unused due to oversight or not being motivated to use the cards. Redeeming the cards for them unlocks the value and fulfills the intent of gift-giving. Retailers need gift cards to be redeemed. Unused gift cards are a liability to retailers. Redemption moves the value of the card from a liability to revenue (and often above the value of the original card purchase). Combining these outcomes creates economic stimulus.","Commerce and Shopping, Financial Services",1,Kevin Strawbridge,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

We serve as a specialized legal team for small to midsized businesses at a predictable flat monthly fee and a client-reported demonstrated return on investment. We look at the business first – its short term and long term initiatives – and then wrap the law around it. With InPrime, business law is no longer reactive, just waiting for things to go awry. Now, you and we can be proactive. Give us every contract, every loan document, every proposal, every letter of intent, all compliance regulations, give us your employee handbook, every job description – anything – and let us review and improve them all, because we want to prevent issues before they become big legal problems. We’re business people first who just happen to be lawyers. What that means to you is we “get it” –  winning legal battles isn’t really a win if you lose a ton of money in the process.  So, we reinvented the old lawyer model, transforming legal from a cost center to a profit center. InPrime Legal was recognized as a market disrupter and innovator.  Most recently, Governor Kemp and the Georgia Department of Economic Development recognized InPrime Legal as the 2019 Small Business Rock Star in the service category.  The Cobb Chamber of Commerce honored InPrime as a Top 25 Small Business for 2018 and 2019.
