Roach understands how complicated accidents are.,"2,262,321",Midwestern US,,Active,2001-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,https://roachlawoffice.com/chesterfield-injury/,"Kevin J. Roach understands how complicated accidents are. Whether it’s a pedestrian accident, a car accident, truck accident, or motorcycle accident, they are almost universally more complicated than they first appear. It is easy to say that an accident occurred but it is much harder to point to the elements present in the situation that caused the accident. Yet if we are going to get a client the compensation they deserve for the personal injuries they suffered, it is our duty to dive headfirst into every little, complicated detail involved in the event that led to their injuries. One way that we handle this is by cultivating a collection of experts whose opinions we can pull on. If a client comes to us looking to bring a medical malpractice suit against their doctor, we know that we have to reach out to the doctors we know. If they suffered a slip and fall then we canvas the area where it occurred to gather enough evidence to prove that those responsible for its upkeep failed in their duty of care. The reason we are able to do what we do, to have the levels of success that we’ve had, is because The Law Offices of Kevin J. Roach, LLC., focuses on an individualized approach. We’re not one of those law firms that is bursting with new clients each and every day. We work with a limited number of victims each year. This isn’t because we’re unpopular. It’s because we want to ensure that each and every client gets the attention they deserve from their attorney. This allows us to offer better service, to get more deeply involved with each of our clients, and, in turn, this has allowed us to get excellent results that honor the suffering our clients have had to face.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

This is a $1,500,000 program, supported in part by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA). To advance as fast as possible with the new technology, Canrom has suspended temporarily all production of wafered silicon solar cells and modules, as well as most of its commercial activity. Thin-film CdTe-based technology has great potential for the large scale application of photovoltaics, as recognized by the Department of Energy/National Renewable Energy Laboratory PV Program and by NYSERDA. Some of the largest companies in the world are developing this technology. Canrom expects to produce CdTe-based modules as large as 28.5 in by 12 in by the end of 2002. At that time, the company will aggressively pursue the sales of these modules. Company growth will be limited only by the capital that we are willing to commit and by the quality of our personnel. The facility for producing single-crystal, wafered-silicon solar cells and modules will be spun off as a separate entity. Canrom is looking for partners to ensure the success of this venture. The silicon solar cell and module operation, which includes know-how, equipment, materials, inventory and a dealer network, is valuated at $3,000,000. Initial production is estimated at 300 kWp/yr. This will be increased incrementally to 1 MWp/yr by the end of the first year of operation.","Energy, Manufacturing, Natural Resources, Sustainability",,,1-10,3,,,,,909300,USD,909300,NYSERDA,,1,,Private,,,,,,
