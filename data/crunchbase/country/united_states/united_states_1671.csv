This has the same license as a retail pharmacy but the specialty allows you to carry medication for patients in need of medicine for their needs. This brings you a location in your area where you can go to for this service instead of having to go to the pharmacy of the hospital which might be quite a distance from the person's home. I plan on opening my business in Brooklyn in a high foot traffic area of Brooklyn. The expenses are the pharmacist pay who handles the products that can be as high as $70 dollars an hr for the supervising pharmacist. Then you take into account the price of the products, Rent, Cashier and that sums up the expenses. its approximately around 300,000 to 350,000 for the location, I plan on having investors for the location its not necessary to invest in the actual company until their is expansion into further locations. This is a Retail business you will be able to track the buying and selling of goods. This is not a restaurant where the doors close after the first year being open its a Great Investment. i'd like to have a decent sized location so that we may administer vaccinations at the location as they do at a doctors office or a hospital. You must realize the size of New York and the amount of the population that needs some kind of medication to remedy their ailments. the pharmacy must be 300 sq ft in size where you close off a section for the Rx products. its a Great business for expansion you can ultimately look to sell products out of multiple locations. To start you can either have hours I chose 9am to 8pm or you can be a 24hr pharmacy but those are much larger.",Health Care,,,,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Hours: Mon-Sun - 10am-6pm Payment: All cc Description: Russian business visas allow for a single, double or multiple visits and may be valid from one to twelve months. While tourist visa cannot be extended, business visa extensions can be arranged through the organisation which provided the invitation for the existing business visa.   Please note that a multiple entry visa is only available for people who have been issued a Russian visa before. A copy of your previous visa should be enclosed to your new application. If this visa was processed before 2013, we strongly recommend that you should contact your local Russian consulate and make sure that a multiple entry visa would still be available.   What are passport requirements for Russian visa? You have to submit your original passport with at least 2 blank visa-designated pages (passport must be valid for at least 6 months after intended departure date from Russia).   Foreign citizen minors must have a power-of-attorney, allowing them to travel if they are travelling alone or in the company of adults who are not their parents. Such miniors will be prevented from entering or leaving Russia if they cannot present such a power-of-attorney. In an effort to prevent international child abduction, many goverments have initiated special procedures at entry/exit points. These often include requiring documentary evidence of relationship and permission for the child's travel from the parent(s) or legal guardian if not present. Having such documentation on hand, even if not legally required, may facilitate entry/departure. ",Travel and Tourism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The immediate source area in southeastern Arizona provides obtainable resources that Management anticipates should last 50 years or more. In the western states where mining has been a way of life since the 1800’s the possible resource sites produces almost limitless possibilities. Because of this, the Company has decided to focus on Southern Arizona and extend out to cover the geologic area where a wealth of old mining sites exist. Many of these are accessible and were worked from the 1800’s and closed prior to 1960.  The remaining deposits are characterized as static materials without serious active environmental activity. Those materials which are abandoned are usually from flotation and smelting operations.    After the more valuable metals have been removed the resulting materials are benign and are marketable materials in the construction and agricultural land development sectors providing us full use of the recycled mining materials. Innovative Recycling provides sustainable economic benefits by providing long term jobs along with ecological benefits to their precious watersheds.

(d/b/a ParalegalGateway.com) is located in the suburban Atlanta, Georgia area and is dedicated to serving and connecting Paralegal professionals.   ParalegalGateway.com was formed in 2001 with humble beginnings. Founded by a Paralegal, Jeannie S. Johnston, the idea for the ParalegalGateway â€œâ€¦came to me while looking for a job. As I searched the internet for employer information, it became obvious to me that there wasnâ€™t one specific site just for Paralegals.  After additional investigation, I was satisfied that the creation of ParalegalGateway would fill a gap on the World Wide Web for Paralegal professionals.â€ ParalegalGateway.com has certainly done just that growing at a rate that certainly surprised its founder. ParalegalGateway.com has become a central source for Paralegals across the globe. Thanks to local associations and publications such as Legal Assistant Today Paralegals are, now more than ever, beginning to receive the recognition they deserve.  One major goal of ParalegalGateway.com is to continue in that spirit, offering support, professional information and above all, recognition to Paralegals who are making a difference in both the legal profession and their communities. Another goal is to promote law firms and companies who offer compensation and incentive programs specifically for their Paralegals. ParalegalGateway will regularly feature employers who have gone above and beyond the standard practices to include Paralegals as a vital part of their organizations. Looking Ahead: The U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics has projected that the Paralegal profession will grow faster than the average for all occupations through 2012. As the Paralegal profession continues to grow, ParalegalGateway.com intends to grow right along side, providing free news, articles, links, career tools and much more to our Paralegal visitors. Making our Internet debut in 2001, our continued web presence proves Paralegals love ParalegalGateway.com. We have big plans for the future and welcome all partnership opportunities.","Government and Military, Privacy and Security, Professional Services",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
