One day, Mr. Orsburne was in his backyard swimming with his two young daughters in their above ground pool. He continually found them hanging on the ladder, clinging the edge of the pool or dangling from him. This led Mr. Orsburne to begin a search for any type of platform system that could provide his daughters something to stand on as they grew and learned how to swim. To his disbelief, there was nothing like this currently on the market at an affordable price. Thus, the idea for Poolcubes was born and the rest is history.  Their product is a set of 10-inch cubed, lightweight, brightly colored, hollow blocks that can be joined together to create many different structures. These Poolcubes can be used to build small islands or """"goals"""" in the water, giving children a closer point to swim to and a place to stand where the water would normally be too deep. With their unique design, they can be broken down flat for easy shipping, storage and then assembly.
