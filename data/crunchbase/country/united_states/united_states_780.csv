It's easy to use and everything is clearly displayed, using Swiss design principles. Reloquence is the only influencer software that consolidates everything you need to run a campaign into one platform. You can see data about influencers that other social media platforms don't openly provide, to better enable you to evaluate which influencers to hire for your business. But the real reason Reloquence is beautiful is that we change one key premise that most influencer marketing companies make: that you need them to find your influencers. We assume that you already know how to search and contact influencers. Then, we give you a place to manage them. Reloquence moves the state of influencer marketing from curated lists of influencers to curated listings of influencers.  The Reloquence White Label Toolkit changes everything.  Most influencer marketing platforms leave off where Reloquence begins. Sure, they will let you contact their influencers, but then how can you develop a relationship with them over time? How can you get to know 50 or 100 or even 500 candidates well enough to know who can best co-create campaigns that will get noticed, without locking yourself into long term contracts prematurely? Do influencer marketing companies want you to take negotiations off-platform? No, they don't. This is where Reloquence can help. Because we have designed our platform around Swiss style, we have made your job infinitely easier. Now, inviting influencers to join your network is as simple as an email campaign. The data that you collect about your influencers is yours to manage. With Reloquence, no one shares a dB. Why? Cost, control and creative. You can downselect your list based on the information you gather yourself. You can filter for fraud and ensure compliance when you control the process. Now, meet your new 10 person in-house influencer team. The campaigns you co-create with your Top 10 influencers can be as thought-provoking and impactful as you want them to be. Your campaigns can be based on big ideas, with images and videos that will give your audience a sense of what you are trying to say in a nanosecond. Because you haven't created your campaign in a nanosecond. You have taken the time to do it right. As the legendary Massimo Vignelli reminds us, ""If you do it right, it will live forever.""","Advertising, Sales and Marketing",1,Megan Eskey,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
