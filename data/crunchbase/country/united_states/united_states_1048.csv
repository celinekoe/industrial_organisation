In 2006, after more than a decade as principals in another consulting business, they decided to form their own company. They founded the business on the premise that success in software consulting is a straight-forward proposition: If you consistently deliver quality software on-time and on-budget, clients will keep coming back, project after project. By applying their decades of expertise in medical devices and clinical instrumentation, several marquee clients quickly came on board. Today, Gale Force has become the engineering partner behind the medical devices of some of the biggest names in medical and lab equipment for clinicians and consumers alike. In addition to this success in the medical space, many commercial clients have followed. A large, well-known commercial access control company helped to usher in a whole new area of practice for the company working with OEMs to advance the technical capability of their products. Finally, one of the best-known consumer brands in the USA joined the Gale Force client list in the last few years. The team helped this company build a cutting-edge product that won awards for its innovation and unique functionality. Moreover, this client and their products cemented the second area of practice for the Gale Force team: product intelligence. Today, the Gale Force team works with numerous companies across several areas of the medical/lab device space and with both industrial and consumer product manufacturers outside of the medical arena. Gale Force has seen tremendous success since its inception. After more than a decade it is a thriving device engineering company working on innovative products in a variety of industries using the latest technologies. Their company’s strength has always been based on the simple truth that working ""with"" a client rather than ""for"" a client leads to successful project outcomes. Their clients see us as their product development strategic partner, and they have continued to succeed as they have helped them win in the marketplace.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware",3,"Marshall Parker, Scott Rulong, Tom Bundy",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

In 1989, Anasazi Software was created specifically to meet a Texas community mental health center's need for a comprehensive billing system, as well as providing fiscal and human resource components. While there were plenty of products on the market to fill this need, this center was looking for a partner that could construct a new method of working hand in hand with their customers, providing the customers not only the voice in development, but the funds to do it. This concept, spawned more than two decades ago, is still very much at the heart of Anasazi's User Groups. Anasazi Software has always answered the call when customers and the market demanded new technologies. Rather than purchasing components from other vendors, or trying to piece together disparate systems, Anasazi Software is one of the only vendors that has built every product they own, assuring perfect symmetry amongst their product line. Since the company's inception and creation of a practice management/billing system, fiscal and human resources components, they have launched a full electronic medical record system, including assessments, treatment planning and progress noting, a complete managed care system, a rarely offered cost accounting system and finally an e-prescribing system.
