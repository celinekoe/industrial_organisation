In the documents management workspace, you can easily upload, download, and track all your documents and files.  Zbizlink’s smart autofill feature and unlimited library of templates makes your job so much easier, allowing you more time to focus on the high-level tasks that require specific expertise.  The metadata consists of the type of contract, name of contracting agency, date of submission, name of authors, editors, and partners, and includes the status— “Go” or “No Go”—and whether each “Go” resulted in a win or a loss. Client feedback and reviews are stored with submitted proposals, and additional notes or “lessons learned” can be filed with each bid or opportunity.  Zbizlink includes its own SharePoint resource library and a contracts database where you can search for contracts, proposals, RFPs, or any file—by subject, data type, author, solicitation number, category, dollar-value range, procurement agency or bidder, NIGP code, date range, date of creation or last modification, partner, and/or by keyword or phrase.  Collaboration: Zbizlink allows business partners, writers, editors, and subject matter experts to share information and work transparently. It fosters productive collaboration by making it very easy to work together in real time, 24/7. The document creation and editing process between users, teams, and partners is streamlined with powerful assessment tools, editing tools in the browser, and smart templates. Email and live chat is available from every module and you can send out notifications and alerts in real time.   The check-in/checkout feature tracks user activity, progress, and document history. This data can also be viewed as reports, which are simple to run and easy to customize. Access can be granted on a proposal-specific basis.  The smart search engine and metadata autofill ensures that all your work will always be easy to find. The built-in version control tool archives previous versions, which cannot be deleted. Backups are created automatically on the cloud and on your hard drive. Content is available offline and online, from any device.  Zbizlink enables successful and proactive collaboration, easy communication among team members, and ready access to everything they need—wherever they are and whenever they want it—right up until submission.  Strategic Analysis: The cornerstone of a successful proposal strategy starts with an efficient process and accurate analysis and assessment. Zbizlink offers a highly effective environment for your staff, your consultants, and your business partners. It allows you to assess and analyze opportunities, partners, and candidates—doing it faster and covering more ground than you have ever done before.  Efficiency begins with an organized process and easy access to the information and resources you need. Zbizlink offers all this and more. It also allows you to complete tasks faster by eliminating much of the tedious repetition inherent in the proposal process. Zbizlink is the only proposal tool on the market with a sophisticated automation tool.  Having access to what you need includes the right partners, team members, and candidates to fill open positions and contracts. When it comes to your proposal strategy, nothing is more important than working with the best available people and focusing on the right opportunities. Zbizlink identifies and evaluates solicitations, business partners, and potential candidates. It helps to prepare the requirements matrix for each solicitation, as well as personnel resumes and detailed skills and qualifications tables for candidates and partners. It automatically fills in many of the required fields.  Based on your profile, Zbizlink can go to work for you right away, identifying appropriate contract vehicles and opportunities—even locating candidate resumes to fit the requirements. Potential partners can find you and send invitations, based on the products or services your company offers.",Information Technology,,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
