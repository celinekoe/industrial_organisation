For example, if you only want guys to review your app, that's fine. If you want people who like to buy shoes online, we can provide that too. Get as specific as you want, but know that the more specific you get, the longer it can take to get all your feedback in. But it never takes more than a few days. The feedback is pretty quick. If you're not too picky about who reviews, you can get all your feedback in really quickly, like within 12 hours. We work with a pool of 100,000 reviewers, so there are tons of people available to do your review. It's affordable. Getting very specific with your reviewer choice on other review sites can get extremely costly, but we don't charge extra for any demographics or interest groups. Learn how to improve. That's the whole point here. With the feedback you get, you'll find tons of ideas how to improve your app or website. I've been running these types of surveys on my own sites for years, and it really makes a difference. Get feedback on an idea before you build. I'm a big fan of Customer Discovery, and running surveys to different demographics to figure out what they really need out of a service, or how they handle a problem currently can yield loads of information to steer you in the right direction when you're building or pivoting your business. Satisfaction guaranteed. If you don't find it helpful, I'll refund you right away. No hard feelings. I expect your feedback to be helpful, but if you're unhappy or it just doesn't work for you, I'll refund your full order as soon as you ask me to.","Commerce and Shopping, Software",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Their company grew quickly, and later in 1972 they moved to a 4000 square foot building. In 1973, they purchased their first vacuum forming machine. The machine was very simple and very limited in its capabilities, but it got the job done. The machine was located in the middle of a facility primarily geared toward fiberglass fabrication. Most of the parts ran on the machine were for the bus and truck Industry. Their customer base and level of production quickly outpaced the size of the facility, which led to the move to a new 35,000 square foot location in 1977 on the south side of  Muncie. This facility is now the home of their fiberglass and composite molding facility. As Arrowhead gained more customers, the need to supply plastic parts as well as fiberglass parts became more apparent. Eventually, they decided that it was time to purchase another building to be used as a vacuum formed plastic production facility. In 1996, they bought a building in Eaton, Indiana and created a separate thermoforming division of Arrowhead Plastic Engineering. This 30,000 square foot facility houses seven thermoforming machines and two (5) axis CNC routers to serve their customers’ diverse plastic production needs.",Manufacturing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
