Wheel Shields are a longboard skateboarding accessory with three powerful features: Splash Protection - Typically when skating over a puddle or wet environment, your wheels will fling dirty water all over your clothes. Instead, Wheel Shields act similar to a mud flap and keep rain and sludge on the ground. Your longboard is now a versatile all-weather transportation vehicle.   ""Wheel bite"" elimination - ""Wheel bite"" is a dangerous safety problem that injured Chase and inspired him to invent Wheel Shields. “Wheel bite” occurs during a hard turn when the bottom of the board comes in contact with the top of the wheel. This stops the wheel suddenly and throws the rider to the ground. By creating a physical barrier around each wheel, Wheel Shields effectively eliminate “wheel bite”. Instead of the board coming in contact with the wheel, it is stopped by the Wheel Shield, allowing the wheel to rotate freely.  New tricks - Wheel Shields also allow riders to stand directly on top of their wheels, opening up all sorts of new trick possibilities. You can invent brand new manuals, colemans, slides and dances with Wheel Shields!  Wheel Shields work universally with almost any longboard and attach to the end of each truck axle. We originally designed Wheel Shields to work with the nuts that come standard on longboards, but found that Wheel Shields would rotate off if you hit a curb or pushed them sideways. Wheel Shields mount using our custom nut setup to ensure they stay firmly in place. Almost all trucks are compatible with the custom nuts except Churchill RKPs, which have a non-standard thread count on the axle.  Wheel Shields work with almost all wheels 75mm and under. Certain wheels with massive contact patches or extreme shapes won’t work, but almost all of your favorites will.

Pastor Vitale was driving from a church service to the house of friends who had invited her for dinner, when she spoke to the Lord about her need for mature teaching. Where is the church that will satisfy me? she asked, and, much to her surprise, the Lord answered, saying, Will you do it? At that time Pastor Vitale was traveling 2-1/2 hours to work in Manhattan, and 2-1/2 hours back, 5 and sometimes 6 days a week. In addition, Pastor Vitale had been chronically ill since she was 12 years old, and was a physically weak and sickly person. In view of Pastor Vitale's circumstances at the time, it is understandable that she respectfully declined, saying, Lord, how can someone in my condition, who does not know, from day to day, whether they will be able to get up and go to work, make a commitment to study and teach on a regular basis? Shortly thereafter, in the Fall of 1987, the Lord approached Pastor Vitale again, and this time Pastor Vitale submitted saying, if You want me to do it, Lord, I will try. The initial meetings were casual and the ministry spontaneous. The first prepared message, The Truth About Witchcraft, was delivered by Pastor Vitale in January of 1988, and the second prepared message, The Seduction Of Eve, was preached on March 12, 1988. Pastor Vitale then began to teach, weekly, beginning with Evil Children, which was brought forth under the anointing of the Holy Spirit on March 20, 1988. Eventually, the meetings increased to two, and then three, each week. Pastor Vitale had moved in the Office of Prophet for several years before she began to teach, so now she was a Prophet and a Teacher of Apostolic Doctrine. She did not begin to move in the Office of Pastor until 1992, however, when she returned from her first trip to Africa, where the Ministry of the Evangelist was birthed in her. Pastor Vitale has been training as a Pastor under the strong hand of Christ Jesus since 1982, and will continue to be a disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ until such time as she accurately reflects His nature.",Education,,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
