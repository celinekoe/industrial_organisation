Someone once said that an idea can change the world, and while at first it is hard to imagine the magnitude of what each person can achieve with their actions, one must always take the first step to make them a reality. At ezFrontiers we want to change the world, but the world of the entrepreneurs, and let them through their ideas make this world a better place for all of us. That is why we want everyone to know that to become an entrepreneur you don't need great things, just a great idea. We know that starting a business is possible for everyone who has the initiative, wherever they live, and that is what we seek to communicate. But not only that, which we do by training entrepreneurs through the content we publish on our various digital platforms, but we also seek to put it into practice. It's very easy to say that everything is simple, but to say it with foundation is something else very different. Thus, through the creation of companies in the United States, we seek to help entrepreneurs from all over the world, especially Spanish-speaking ones, to effectively carry out their projects, supporting them with the required procedures. For many it is complex, and we do not want bureaucratic obstacles to ruin an idea that, perhaps, can change the world. It's a first step, the rest is up to them, but we want to be there to do our bit. It is said that when undertaking the most important thing is to start, and we are very clear about that, because when we started this project, ezFrontiers, we also went through that stage. Creating a company for many sounds like something that is only reserved for executives with a tie or people with a lot of money who are in an office at the top of a building full of glass panels that make it look elegant, but no. On a day-to-day basis, SMEs are the drivers of every country's economy, they are the engine that generates jobs and changes the lives of millions of people. That is why we are motivated to liberalize the creation of companies, to make every entrepreneur see that there are no obstacles to start a business. That it does not matter their nationality, profession or way of thinking, because anyone, as long as they are over 18, can create a company to bring their ideas to life. And not only that, but working for them, because that is another issue that motivates us, working for oneself.",Professional Services,1,Gonzalo Parragué,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

We’re rethinking the entire employment paradigm as we strive to advance the recruiting process and the economy as a whole. Today’s job market is a challenge for job seekers, career professionals, employers, recruiters and even the government. With high unemployment rates, applicants struggle to be noticed and must now brand and market themselves for the duration of their careers. With countless applicants for each posted position, recruiters find it hard to identify qualified candidates without spending excessive time and money. Educational institutions which could help bridge the skills gap are inadequately involved in the process. There is a well-recognized need to enhance collaboration between all of these parties. Existing job boards and networking sites can be a waste of time and effort. Job seekers and job posters are equally frustrated by the system’s inadequacies.
