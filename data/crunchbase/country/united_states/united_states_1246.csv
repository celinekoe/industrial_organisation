They are a private publishing company that's based in Baltimore Maryland.  The entire service is built on the back of Porter's newsletter, Stansberry's Investment Advisory.  The monthly newsletter deals with safe investments, and critiques the state of the current market, to explore what the best moves are for new and veteran investors right now.  Porter has the pedigree to be a respected financial advisor as well.  His biggest claim to fame was actually predicting the mortgage crisis well before it hit the United States.  Porter Stansberry was also the first American editor of Britain's longest running financial newsletter, the Fleet Street Letter. Currently  Stansberry Research provides more than 20 expert financial analysts that regularly create educational and analytical articles related to finance and global economics. The range of viewpoints held by those analysts represents one of the strengths of Stansberry Research. Rather than present one unified view of financial markets to which all analysts must adhere, the publisher instead promotes what it calls its mosaic of opinions, encouraging each analyst to utilize their own expertise when crafting their work. In this way, readers are presented with a diverse range of thoughts and can better utilize the information that is most relevant to their personal financial sensibilities and goals. This method of operation is derived from the publisher’s desire to provide only the highest quality analysis to readers. That drive is codified in the two basic principles that guide the firm’s actions. The first of these is a commitment to giving customers the information that those at the firm would want if their roles were reversed. The second principle is a pledge to work with analysts whose viewpoints they’d feel comfortable having their friends and families follow.","Content and Publishing, Financial Services, Media and Entertainment",1,Porter Stansberry,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

They users of social media have no choice but to have their online experience dictated to them by other users & businesses as they push their opinions, politics, humor, ads, and more out to the world with little regard for the psychological effect that content and privacy-abusing advertising can have on people and society as a whole. It’s for these reasons that over half of all Americans agree that social media is a negative influence on the world. Businesses’ (especially SMBs) only way of knowing when and why people are interested in their products is reactively, once they have been exposed to their advertising. These companies are losing out on a completely untapped area of business-to-customer communication where, preemptively, companies are able to generate revenue from customers who have never interacted with their advertising in any way.  Solution: WhoYou allows users to have complete control over their social media experience because, for the user, YOU are the master of the content that you see, hear, and feel. You are able to pull out the information from other users that you’re interested in, freeing you from the incessant negativity that is now available. For businesses, user’s cynical insinuations caused by your advertising will disappear, as you will be able to communicate in a real, unobtrusive human manner with those people most interested in the products and services that you provide, in a completely preemptive manner.
