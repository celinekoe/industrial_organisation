U*tique Shops™ present a highly edited selection of 56 “must-have” premium lifestyle items and assort them adjacent to a large digital sign which can promote via rich media (built-in advertising).  The automated storefront builds recognition without traditional ad spend, and provides a high net profit/low operating cost and low risk distribution option given its mobile format (on wheels).   Most compelling, these automated storefronts are rich sources of data and advertising impact.  Thousands of user sessions are collected and analyzed in each location per month and continue to inform expansion activities.  Users are opting-in for communication from the brand at high rates (via e-receipts – 75% opt in), which drives lead generation, raising recognition of the brand’s activities online and in the physical landscape.  U*tique is building on this momentum by developing an engaging omni-channel consumer experience (automated – web – mobile), that will combine the best of digital commerce with instant gratification product delivery, in addition to centralized real time management through its Portal™ system.   Already U*tique is centrally fulfilling e-commerce orders completed at its automated stores (consumers can order-to-ship at the U*tique). U*tique Shops™ are currently in high profile venues nationwide, including The Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas, The Palms Casino Resort, and the Hilton Union Square in San Francisco.   U*tique was recently awarded the Best New Airport Retail Concept in North America by ACI, the Gold Innovation Award for Best Store Design by NAMA, and was named to McKinsey’s “Ones to Watch in Retail” report.
