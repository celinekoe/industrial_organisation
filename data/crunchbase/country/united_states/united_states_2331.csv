Made from thick wool, the long length and open body of the kilt provided warmth and freedom of movement. Every kilt was handmade with care and pride, as there were no kilt factories at that time. As the kilt became more popular, it became a symbol of Scottish heritage and culture and was worn by people from all walks of life. However, the traditional art of making kilts has been lost over time, as manufactured kilts have taken over. These generic styles lack the richness and quality of the original kilts and are made with cheap materials that do not do justice to the Scottish culture. At Scottish Kilt Shop, we refuse to compromise on the authenticity of the Scottish kilt. We believe that every Scot should take pride in their culture by wearing premium kilts that reflect their history and heritage. We use high-quality materials to create each kilt by hand, in the original process, so that you can be proud to own a piece of true Scottish heritage.

We differentiate us from the rest by creating a strong branding around HMO and advocating the importance of feeding gut bacteria. We are the first company in the world to launch a complete line of HMO products for adults and have been recommended by Ben Greenfield Fitness.  PureHMO® prebiotic line is developed to optimize people’s gut microbiome - boost the key bacteria, increase microbial diversity, and address various gut-related issues (IBS, SIBO, leaky gut etc). PureHMO® line is centered around a core ingredient: human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) – an ingredient that is only available in recent years. This is the only prebiotic for infants to build a healthy gut microbiome from scratch. The traditional prebiotics galactooligosaccharide (GOS), Fructooligosaccharide (FOS), were added to infant formula only to simulate the functions of HMO, which also include immune modulation and cognitive support.  Unlike traditional solutions of using probiotic to address gut health problems, our concept is to use PureHMO® to feed the bacteria existed in the gut, strategically boost their growth, and build an optimized microbiome. More science has shown that probiotic supplements only solve problems temporally and cannot improve the long-term microbiome composition, which can only be tuned by diet - the food for gut bacteria.  Compared to traditional GOS and FOS prebiotics, HMO is new, has unique structures and more functions that makes HMO more attractive to consumers. HMO is a selective food for key gut probiotics - Bifidobacteria and Akkermansia. HMO directly fights with pathogens. HMO also provides fuel for cognitive functions. Our goal is to build a complete line of HMO products to address various gut-related health problems, with different product forms and flavors. We have 5 registered trademarks, and 1 granted U.S. patent that is on a carb-blocking and fiber-boosting gut health ingredient and 1 pending patent of HMO.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
