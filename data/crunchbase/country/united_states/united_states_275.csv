We foster new, modern ways for students to learn and teachers to teach. In Global Online Academy, teachers and students share their voice on a global stage, improving learning and enabling the pursuit of individual passions. OUR MISSION The mission of Global Online Academy is to replicate in online classrooms the intellectually rigorous programs and excellent teaching that are hallmarks of its member schools; to foster new and effective ways, through best practices in online education, for students to learn; and to promote students’ global awareness and understanding by creating truly diverse, worldwide, online schoolroom communities. OUR STORY In March 2011, Lakeside School invited representatives from 15 global peer schools to Seattle to discuss what best-in-class online learning looks like, why it’s important right now, and how a consortium of leading independent schools can work together to shape the future of online learning and bring the benefits of online learning to their teachers and students. Global Online Academy launched in April 2011 with ten member schools and five online classes. Today, Global Online Academy has over 50 member schools and in 2014-2015 will offer more than 50 courses. OUR BELIEFS –	Online is a platform, not a pedagogy, allowing for multiple teaching  strategies and methods. It is an experiential, active way to learn –	Online learning is not a replication of offline learning –  it’s its own environment that allows for expanded opportunities  –	Our students will be global citizens, in need of global values; teaching students  empathy, global awareness, and exposure to different points of view is critical  –	Students learn better when given a certain amount of autonomy in their pursuit of learning  –	Everyone should have opportunities to pursue their passions and develop  their individuality; learning should not be limited by college mandates –	Different and new environments promote reflection and growth; online allows teachers  and students to rethink their beliefs, passions, roles, and ways of relating to one another","Community and Lifestyle, Education",,,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
