Eco Friendly Filter Pavers: 1. Fast Water Permeability: The water permeability of RechSand Filter Pavers is very fast, which can reach 780kg of water per square meter per hour. RechSand Filter Pavers have experienced severe rainstorms in Beijing 721 (one in 60 years). There was no stagnant water in the Olympic underground plaza where RechSand Filter Pavers were laid . ! 2. Permeability Life Span: The permeable principle of the Filter Paver is “destroying the surface tension of water”. The water permeable period can reach more than 30 years! It is 10 times that of ordinary permeable brick. 3. Anti-clogging Technology: The surface of the brick is very dense, micron-sized, and is not easily blocked by dust, also very easy to clean. 4. Antifreeze and thaw: A brick has many capillaries and small pores. The volume of water becomes ice is small, the dispersion is high, and the expansion is small, so the brick is less prone to become frozen. Add a special binder to make the bricks tough. The capillary inside the brick is evenly distributed, and the single pore has a small diameter with no stress concentration. 5. Anti-weight: RechSand Filter Paver can withstand a weight within 100 tons 6. Super wear-resistance: The main raw material of brick is aeolian sand. It is a hard point formed by millions of years and wind-blown sand. It is made by special technology and has the wear resistance like a grinding wheel. 7. It has the function of water filtration: the brick filters the water. It can filter large particles of impurities in rainwater. 8. Recyclable products: RechSand independently developed a set of sand recycling equipment, which can recycle old Filter Pavers and make new ones. 9. Eco-Friendly Manufacturing Process AKA Adopting the technology of no-sintering molding: This technology can make the Filter Pavers can be consolidated at room temperature, and the sintering process can be completed with only a small amount of energy. 10. Can be used with rainwater harvesting system: Filter Pavers are the key components of the RechSand rainwater harvesting system. They can be used together with the RechSand rainwater harvesting system to collect, purify and store the rainwater to maximize the rainwater resources. Water Saving Sand: 1.

Replenish ground surface water, allows the growth of trees and agricultural products in the desert, offers a solution to desertification 3.  Roots can breathe freely underground, promoting healthy growth of plants 4.  Preserves nutrients in the soil increasing fertilizer efficiency 5.  More and more agricultural lands are being converted to factories and cities to make way for urban development. Our specially Coated Sand allows agricultural products to grow healthily in the desert, providing a smart alternative to meet the needs of a growing population. At the same time, this is also a way to combat desertification, killing two birds with one stone 6.  Saves water by 70%, increases production by 30% Flooring Tiles & Insulation Board: The invention of the new technology of “increasing the surface tension of water” realizes the effect of “breathing and seepage prevention”. The desert silica sand is used as raw material to create ecological sand-based building materials with breathable and impervious water. The core products are silica sand flexible stone and silica sand soft stone. Composite insulation hanging board, super non-slip silica sand floor.  At the same time, it also invented the “reinforced concrete diagonal support” structural system and the “sandwich” wall envelope structure, providing strong technical support for China’s residential industrialization. RechSand is responsible for the industrialization and popularization of the technical achievements in the field of “sand building”. Advantages: 1. To tackle the rapid expansion of cities and the growing volume of global construction, we develop high-quality Eco-friendly building materials with high performance and unique qualities 2. Effectively lowers the chance of fire hazard and fire expansion 3. Natural insulator, saving energy from using heater and air-conditioning We appreciate your comments and we’d like to work with you no matter where you are around the world!","Agriculture and Farming, Consumer Goods, Energy, Manufacturing, Real Estate, Sustainability",,,501-1000,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

They are dedicated to providing high quality research for institutional investors and superior execution for their corporate clients. The idea of working harder to help institutions understand and invest in complicated growth stocks is not new. Fast moving growth companies and investors in those companies have long relied on a better quality of service from focused investment banks like Pacific Growth Equities. Consolidation in the financial services industry combined with a single minded focus on investment banking revenue among those firms that remain have left investors and companies with an ever dwindling pool of independent, reliable advisors. They offer a full range of investment banking and brokerage services including Public Equity offerings, Private Equity offerings, and Mergers & Acquisitions. Their focus is on those life sciences, technology, healthcare and consumer growth companies where their brand of high value in-depth research makes a difference. Their Sales & Trading team is broad and deep, with on average 15 years of experience working with growth stocks. They enjoy mutually respectful relationships with the top institutional buyers of emerging growth stocks both in the US and abroad. Perhaps most important of all, their clients have immediate access to senior professionals in every area of the firm. They're not only large enough to serve all your investment banking needs, they haven't forgotten that ""hands on"" management from their top people is critical to successful completion of your transaction. And since they're independent and employee-owned, you're always dealing with someone who owns a piece of the business. Pacific Growth Equities is an entrepreneurial company focused on getting the job done. They have brought together years of experience at old-line investment banks, and eliminated the politics and slow-moving, top-heavy corporate mentality. Their corporate culture was forged in the entrepreneurial climate of the information age, and they often find that their business style is more closely attuned to their entrepreneurial clients than their co-managers. Innovation is part of doing business at Pacific Growth Equities. They have a history of being very creative and coming up with ""outside the box"" solutions to meet the needs of both their institutional and investment banking clients. They believe that the best ideas have frequently not been tried before.","Financial Services, Lending and Investments",,,,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The tin-117m based products have been developed under the Initiative for Proliferation Prevention (IPP) program in collaboration with the US Department of Energy and Brookhaven National Laboratory initially using reactors in Russia.  This early work validated the imaging and therapeutic effects predicted for tin-117m.   Under this IPP program a proton accelerator method of producing the tin-117m at higher specific activities was then developed in collaboration with the Institute for Nuclear Research near to Moscow.  This production method has been demonstrated to be transferable to a number of institutions in the USA and elsewhere where the product could be made at will.   Innovative work by Dr. Nigel Stevenson led to a new tin-117m production method using alpha particles and a cadmium-116 target.  This is now the primary method that is routinely used to manufacture the tin for the clinical trial product.    In conjunction with this, the development of our primary product, Tin-Annexin, has led to numerous pre-clinical and clinical trials that have demonstrated the viability of not only imaging the vulnerable plaque but, more importantly, therapeutically treating the condition.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Manufacturing, Science and Engineering",1,Gilbert Gonzales,1-10,3,,5423014,USD,5423014,7082422,USD,7082422,Arcus Ventures,,1,,Private,,,,,,
