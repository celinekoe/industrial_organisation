Luxottica's proprietary brands include Ray-Ban, Oakley and Persol, and it licenses with Chanel, Dolce & Gabbana, Giorgio Armani, Michael Kors and many others. It also owns and operates Sunglass Hut, Lenscrafters, Pearl Vision, and Glasses.com. Luxottica has crafted the illusion of variety, cheapened the quality of their frames, raised prices, edged out competition and made it difficult for the end-customer to find good eyewear at a fair price.  New York Glass is different in that we retail designers and independent labels who take pride in manufacturing their own frames. The brands we carry are socially conscious, fashion-forward, and reasonably priced. Typically found in specialty shops around the world, we've brought these names together under one roof to curate a deep selection of the highest-quality eyewear out there.

The idea for APGR Green emerged as a way to eliminate pesky moles without causing damage to the environment, soil and water resources, pets and most importantly our children. APGR Green was extended to extinguish  ants when a native Texan joined the venture. It was his belief that APGR Green’s concept would also be effective in controlling these populations. Testing in Texas and Louisiana proved his theory.  Out of extensive research and testing, Mole-Zap and Ant-Zap were born. Using food grade CO2 (used in sodas, sparkling water, fountain drinks, etc.), it was discovered that by displacing oxygen in mole burrows and ant mounds, the animal would simply go to sleep and not wake up. Finally, providing an environmentally safe solution to get rid of these pests that actually works. APGR Green provides an EPA approved Fumigant, which has no run-off or residue, that is a “one-of-a-kind” alternative to chemical-based pesticides. Ant-Zap is OMRI Listed for organic use by the Organic Materials Research Institute.
