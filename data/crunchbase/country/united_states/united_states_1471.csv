The initial product, “Lap-Pak”, is a medical device designed for the roughly two million major abdominal surgeries (“laparotomies”) performed annually in the United States. Current practice utilizes cotton towels or sponges to reposition the bowel and allow access to the surgical area. This procedure is time consuming, presents potential safety risks to patients and can lead to post-operative complications. Seguro’s “Lap-Pak” device is a flexible, one–piece, device contoured to enable the rapid and secure re-positioning of the bowels to expose the surgical site. Lap-Pak can be placed quickly and eliminates the need for repositioning during surgery. This allows the surgical team to fully focus on the surgery while saving up to 25 minutes of expensive surgery time (approximately $1,000 savings per procedure). The device was developed by surgeons and biomedical engineering students from the BME undergraduate design course at Johns Hopkins under the leadership of Robert E.

Vance had worked in the acute care industry as a Hospital Administrator and Corporate Vice President of a national Hospital and assisted living management company. Vance became a partner in a company which designed and franchised assisted living businesses nationally.  Diane was asked to develop a menu system for assisted living facilities in over 12 states based on extensive research of all dietary regulation in each state. She started her dietary consulting business and in a short period of time had menu systems in over 300 facilities across the Western United States. After several years of learning to juggle and balance all of the elements of a quality menu program, Diane discovered that it was becoming more and more difficult to meet all of the needs of owners, operators, care staff, residents, and other customers with a 500 page hard copy manual that was not changeable.  It was a good product she had developed, but it was not good enough. There had to be better options which would allow greater flexibility and choice, and make the job of preparing quality meals easier for the average care staff, and most importantly, meet the dietary preferences and needs of those sitting at the table. Diane spent several years researching food preferences, food cost trends, and using her knowledge to create simple yet quality recipes and menus. She was determined to find a product that met all of her clients’ needs and would allow everyone to be happy.  In 2008, she partnered with Richard Oldham to devise the better solution. The idea was a web based on-line computer system which would be interactive and dynamic. In 2009, Grove Menus was launched as a web based menu planning program. Grove Menus has grown rapidly into a nationwide company that provides menu plans to a broad client base. The Grove Menus system is simple and powerful. Clients include large and small healthcare and personal care facilities.","Health Care, Software",2,"Diane Fager, RD, Richard Oldham",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
