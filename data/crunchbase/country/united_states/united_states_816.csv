Research in academic integrity and contract cheating recommends that instructors read a student's submission and ask questions about their work. In an ideal world, instructors would have the time to be able to do this. Unfortunately, with pressing demands from administration, research, and life, many professors do not have the time to question students about their work - and that's why we created Auth+. Auth+ is a patent-pending ghostwriting deterrent on an AI engine. We take the first read for the instructor, question the student, and follow up with the student as needed.
