Former Indianapolis Sentinel reporter John Holliday founded The News. It published Monday through Saturday. Under Holliday, The News was politically neutral and committed to the community. It exposed graft by Indiana Supreme Court judges in 1876. It pushed for the creation of the first city charter and a Chamber of Commerce. The News fought an attempt by Standard Oil Co. to distribute natural gas in Indianapolis. In 1909, a libel suit was filed against The News by the federal government when the newspaper questioned Theodore Roosevelt’s work on the Panama Canal deal. Editors of The News were indicted but refused to be tried in Washington, saying the trial should be held in Indianapolis where the alleged libel took place. The judge ruled in favor of The News, and the ruling still stands as a landmark victory for the freedom of the press. Holliday ran the paper until ill health forced him to sell to a group of investors led by William H. Smith of Chicago and Charles Warren Fairbanks. Fairbanks was a former secretary of state and served as vice president during Theodore Roosevelt’s second term. Smith served as publisher until his death in 1896. His son Delavan Smith was publisher from 1896 until 1921. Fairbanks' sons Warren, Frederick and Richard would serve as publishers successively from 1921-44. Under Warren Fairbanks, The News won a Pulitzer Prize in 1932 for an 18-month campaign to cut waste in city and county government. The News would become Indiana’s largest newspaper and would be known as ""The Great Hoosier Daily."" In 1948, Eugene C. Pulliam purchased The News from the Fairbanks family and remained its publisher until his death in 1975. When The Indianapolis Times folded in 1965, The News became the city’s only evening newspaper. Eugene S. Pulliam became publisher in 1975 after his father died and served until his own death in 1999. Dale Duncan was named his successor. The trend of declining circulation and the demise of afternoon newspapers across the country had finally hit The News. In 1995, the newsroom staffs of The Star and The News merged, but the editorial staffs and pages remained separate. On Oct. 1, 1999, The Indianapolis News published its last newspaper. The Indianapolis Star celebrated its 100th anniversary on June 6, 2003. The brainchild of Muncie industrialist George F. McCulloch, The Star challenged the two existing morning newspapers in the city, the Journal and the Sentinel. McCulloch paid a balloonist $650 to drop red stars on the city in the days leading up to the launch on June 6, 1903. Others were dropped from the Soldiers and Sailors Monument, which had been dedicated the previous May. A year and two days after The Star began, it absorbed the Journal, and in 1906 it purchased the Indianapolis Sunday Sentinel.","Content and Publishing, Government and Military, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Other",1,George F.

Our in-house AI/ML models help us in: - Building individual learning paths. - Optimizing marketing costs. - Deep user database segmentation (psychological, behavioral, and interests based) Customer Problem The main problem we face is the language barrier between peoples. This specifically applies to EU as a multi-lingual community. From other hand the biggest challenge for learning a foreign language is time. Advanced online technologies provide many learning opportunities but all of them require 100% focus for a long period of time which many people do not have. Products & Services To solve this problem, we turned the flashcards that students often use to memorize words into audio flashcards. Over 2000 people say that Worddio is a great tool for learning new words. With Worddio you can learn new words on the move or while doing something else, without touching your phone. Through this method, the learner will also memorize the pronunciation in the correct way, spoken by a native language speaker. We safe students time! Target Market The Worddio app is designed specifically for people learning a foreign language and who don't have time to learn and memorize new words. The Global Online Language Learning Market was valued at $12.49 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach $25.73 billion by 2027. With its 34 languages Worddio has potential usefulness for over 90% of the world population. Does it work? We have more than 200K installations and more than 1300 paying users. Business Model - subscriptions: 1, 3, 6 and 12 months, lifetime - up-sales of premium content - advanced flashcards by topics, Audiobooks and Podcasts. - Ads - general or targeted based on user profiles - Apply data & technology to other platforms/apps/fields . . . Developing a B2C model on a global level takes time and resources to break even, but once that happens, the return on investment is maximized at scale. Customer Segments Professionals: adults looking to improve their foreign-language skills for business or career reasons Casual learners: travelers, expats, or other persons wishing to learn a new language or enhance their current knowledge Sector-specific: Service workers, such as call-center staff or healthcare workers, who can perform better with a larger vocabulary and accurate pronunciation. Youth: 12-20 year-olds studying secondary languages in schools Sales & Marketing Strategy We have technology that allows us to build psychological profiles and predict users' behaviours without accessing their sensitive data. We can build bespoke learning paths, custom sales funnels, and target ads. The data gathered allow the pursue of three main objectives: optimzing marketing resources by leveraging predictive machine learning models creating individual learning paths based on users needs upsale of particular content or products Competitors The language learning apps space looks crowded but in fact there is a specific empty niche - passive learning. There are a lot of language learning apps on the market, but none of them use a passive learning method to save time for their users - Worddio is the only one that does. We are opening a new market group to support language learning. The Worddio app is a pseudo-passive learning app powered by AI which saves student time. Competitive Advantage Worddio main advantages are: - our app’s passive learning method  - huge stock of professionally recorded audio-flashcards in 34 languages. - scientific-based approach that leverages ML and AI to optimize costs and improve user experience - premium content section - AI features that will help us deliver the ultimate hands-free experience to our users.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Education, Science and Engineering, Software",1,Ivan Manev,11-50,1,Seed,250000,USD,250000,250000,USD,250000,"Loyal VC, Innovation Capital",,2,,Private,,,,,,

Alan readily admits that their original paradigm of serving the homeless had some flaws, but with the help of a formerly homeless man, they perfected the model that they successfully use today. That first trip was in September of 1998; by December of that year there was enough money to purchase a 1997 Ford F-250 pick-up truck with a catering bed. Since that first truck run, teams of volunteers have served meals with a side of hope to the homeless and working poor on the streets of Austin and San Antonio, Texas; Providence, Rhode Island; New Bedford, Massachusetts; and Minneapolis, Minnesota. To date, Mobile Loaves & Fishes has served over 4 million meals, and with the support of more than 18,000 volunteers, they are the largest prepared feeding program to the homeless and working poor in Austin. Today, in addition to continuing their truck ministry, they have expanded to include their Community First! Housing Program and the ROADS Micro-Enterprise Program. Please join us in feeding, loving, and helping those men and women who need it most.","Community and Lifestyle, Other, Social Impact",1,Alan Graham,11-50,2,,,,,100000,USD,100000,"HCA Healthcare Foundation, WellSky Foundation",2,2,,Private,,,,,,

Sperax has built a mobile application, Sperax Play, and is building a DeFi ecosystem with a suite of various products, including the automatic yield-bearing stablecoin SperaxUSD, synthetic assets, and derivatives products. With these products, Sperax aims to bridge the gap to the blockchain for both experienced and novice crypto users. SperaxUSD is a crypto collateralised algorithmic yield-bearing stablecoin using a dual token system - SperaxUSD stablecoin and its governance token, SPA. SperaxUSD is partially collateralized and partially backed by the protocol’s ability to mint SPA when redeeming USDs. This allows for SperaxUSD to operate like DAI during market contraction and UST during market expansion. Sperax’s mobile app, Sperax Play (which will be rebranded to Spark), plans to house an NFT marketplace and host Sperax’s Defi products to a global user base. Sperax Play currently has over 600k users, with plans to further expand into Q1 of 2022.
