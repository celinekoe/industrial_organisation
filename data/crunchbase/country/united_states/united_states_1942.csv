Drawing on MIT Sloan’s strengths in technology and innovation, its internationally recognized faculty, and more than a decade of research and partnership with MIT Sloan’s Center for Digital Business, the IDE is analyzing the broad sociological changes brought about by the advance and spread of digital technology.  While digital technologies are rapidly transforming both business practices and societies and are integral to the innovation-driven economies of the future, they are also the core driver of the great economic paradox of their time. On one hand, productivity, wealth, and profits are each at record highs; on the other hand, the median worker in America is poorer than in 1997, and fewer people have jobs. Rapid advances in technology are creating unprecedented benefits and efficiencies, but there is no economic law that says everyone, or even a majority of people, will share in these gains.  Technology is advancing quickly, but organizations and skills advance slowly. What’s more, the gap between swiftly evolving technology and the slower pace of human development will grow rapidly in the coming decades, as exponential improvements in artificial intelligence, robotics, networks, analytics, and digitization affect more and more of the economy and society. Inventing effective organizations and institutions for the digital economy is the grand challenge for their time, and for MIT in particular.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Education, Science and Engineering, Software",,,10001+,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Unlike the typical single-axis swing that only moves back and forth, the Super Spinner gives your child a multi-axis toy with more degrees of freedom while keeping them safe. Children can sit or lie down on the seat and still be securely on The Super Spinner. And it can be adjusted to hang as low as 4 inches from the ground, making it accessible to even the littlest ones. The Super Spinner is also sturdy enough for play by the larger kids, too. It can hold up to 125 pounds, and it is supported by easy-grip rope that we have tested ourselves for its carrying strength. The patented seat is made from extremely durable plastic that is reinforced by an inner steel ring to ensure greater stability. And the concave shape of the seat provides extra comfort and security for the rider. As parents and engineers, we seek to create toys for our children that are as fun and as safe as possible. Since our children will decide how enjoyable our products are, we believe that our role is to be the “safety police.” That’s why we conduct our own independent testing, to make sure certain parts perform as advertised. In addition, we manufacture or source key components in the United States, where we can oversee product quality and ensure no hazardous materials are employed…and, of course, to support American businesses. For example, our seat is thermoformed in Rittman, Ohio. With each box we ship, we include a complimentary copy of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission’s Outdoor Home Playground Safety Handbook. We hope that you find this to be a helpful resource guide in setting up your backyard (or front yard!) play area, and we hope that your children enjoy the Super Spinner as much as ours do! Features: •	Weight limit: 125 lbs •	All components are weather-resistant •	28” seat made from HDPE (high density polyethylene), a BPA-free plastic •	Twisted solid rope made from 3/8” polypropylene, independently tested up to 250 lbs •	3-hole chrome adjusters allow it to hang as low as 4” off the ground •	Assembly hang height: 3.5’ to 5.5’ (from top of carabiner to bottom of seat) •	Minimum operating temperature: 0° F •	Recommended ages:  3-12 •	For residential use only •	Adult installation required •	U.S. Patent awarded",Consumer Goods,,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
