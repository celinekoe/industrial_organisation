By exposing the saturated plastic to enough heat to soften it rather than melt it, the gas will nucleate into billions of bubbles, and be held in place by the solid state plastic. Eight years ago our founders realized that applying this technology to the most recycled plastic on earth would result in dramatic impacts in the sustainability.  On September 11, 2002, MicroGREEN Polymers was incorporated in Washington State. The ""Micro"" part of our name is an abbreviation of microcellular technology, while ""green"" connotes the eco-friendly nature of that technology.  When the company was formed, the founders, Greg Branch and Krishna Nadella, were working on their PhDs at the University of Washington in the field of microcellular polymer manufacturing.

Daily national news stories remind of us all of how kids are bombarded by bullying, profanity, nudity, sexting and more on their smartphones. The list of internet threats to teens and tweens only continues to grow. Instant access to Cyberspace via smartphones has dramatically changed parenting, and parents worry and wonder what they can do about these complex problems. In response to these threats, a couple of dads who saw their teens engulfed by their smartphones for hours every day said “enough is enough”. They set out to develop an app that is so technically advanced that it can lean forward into the swarm of new teen apps coming at kids at an ever-increasing accelerated pace on the internet. Social Judo was born, the app that uses the power of the internet against the power of the internet. This app shows what current content is on a child’s phone, analyzes it, and reports back to a parent if there is concerning content or even possibe danger. This new app uses artificial intelligence (AI) to Help Social Judo scour the internet and identify new dangers and threats. The AI component of Social Judo then brings that information back to the development team with ideas and suggestions on how to protect your kid from the dangers of these new apps without spying on them.  Dr. Matt Philips, a brain surgeon and visionary behind the development of this new app said; “I want to help establish the paradigm of parenting children in Cyberspace. We parent at home, we parent on the playing fields, we parent at school, but in the one space our kids spend 5-6 hours per day, goes unparented and virtually unsupervised. “It’s not your child that you need to be concerned about”, continues Philips. He notes it can be the other kids your child interfaces with daily. All it takes is one kid showing your child porn, or nudity, or explaining sex without love, and, once that has happened, you can’t take it back, you can’t un-see it. In most cases, you’re not even aware this has happened. Getting an alert sent to a parent’s phone that your child has been looking at or has been sent these kinds of messages or images is what Social Judo accomplishes, Dr. Philips calls it a “parenting moment”. From the parent’s app on a smartphone, they can lock a child’s phone, making it impossible to continue to be bullied or sent this kind of material. If you’re interested in talking about cyber bullying, the neuroscience behind smartphone addiction, teen suicide or “death by smartphone”, and a whole host of other subjects, then Dr. Philips, the new national expert on these subjects, would love to chat with you. Like himself, he wants other parents to be aware of the dangers of smartphone use and abuse that our children are being exposed to every day.

Consumers describe what they need done and specify when and where their job should take place.  Using patent-pending machine learning and semantic technology, Redbeacon determines the best local service providers for the job.  If matched, service providers get notified by email and text message and are given the opportunity to submit a price quote.  Consumers can then select and book appointments with their top choice service provider based on a comparison of business profiles, price quotes, and ratings and reviews from past Redbeacon consumers.  Redbeacon is also the only website where consumers can go for urgent or immediate requests (e.g., ""I need someone to come change my tire immediately"") and get back an Estimated Time of Arrival from interested service providers in their area. For service providers, Redbeacon may represent a better value proposition than other online marketing options because it is free to create skill profiles and receive job leads.  Service Providers only pay a small commission when they win a job, which minimizes the risk of wasted marketing dollars.  Redbeacon is also useful for service providers who wish to offer long-tail services or services at irregular times, such as nights and weekends.

We strive to bring you natural, premium ingredients so you can feel good about snacking. We believe a healthy diet includes a balanced mixture of protein, fiber, and carbohydrates to help you stay fit and active. Eating well doesn't have to mean eating tasteless, bland foods. It does, however, mean eating a healthy, wide range of foods from every food group.  We want to make snacking easy and enjoyable whether you're at home or on the go. We know that staying fit and maintaining a healthy diet can often be a challenge when you need a snack in a hurry. Available snacking options are usually loaded with high fructose corn syrup and sugar. Often finding a tasty alternative to satisfy the munchies can be a challenge. At Peeled Snacks, we use the highest quality fruit without any added sugar to help you towards achieving the five-a-day servings of fruit you need. Peeled Snacks are loaded with a natural source of vitamins, minerals, and fiber that your body craves.  We are dedicated to raising awareness through various educational campaigns; our goal is to inform consumers about the impacts of daily dietary choices. Recently, we've partnered with the American Diabetes Association to help families make the best decisions possible about the food they consume. Today Americans face the risk of diabetes and obesity on an alarming scale, due in large part to irresponsible practices of the food industry. At Peeled Snacks, we promote healthy eating habits as well as strive to use the most environmentally sustainable business practices. We source only organic ingredients and try to buy from local farmers and growers whenever possible. For our product display cases, we use recycled paper.
