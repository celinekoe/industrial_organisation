Founded in January 2003, Optichron focuses on a significant technology challenge - a solution to the performance bottleneck caused by nonlinear distortion, a long-standing engineering barrier in many industries relying on signal processing technologies. Industry experts have long recognized nonlinear distortion as the principal roadblock to tapping the optimum performance potential in communications, data conversion and other signal processing applications because previous engineering approaches were inefficient, inadequate, cumbersome or expensive. There team has developed a proprietary mathematical approach to solving nonlinear distortion, from which we have derived a robust integrated circuit architecture that is the core of our linearization products. By efficiently eliminating all types of nonlinear distortion, our linearization technology significantly improves the parameters for overall system design and, through reduced component count and more efficient operation, lowers cost and power consumption. We embed our linearization technology in our practical, high-performance linearization products for applications such as wireless communications, software-defined radio, medical imaging, satellite communications, radar, infrared imaging, and test and measurement instrumentation.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Manufacturing, Science and Engineering",1,Roy Batruni,11-50,3,M&A,30990000,USD,30990000,30990000,USD,30990000,"U.S. Venture Partners, VentureTech Alliance, Battery Ventures, TL Ventures",,4,,Private,,,,,,
