According to reports, digital advertising spending has overtaken every form of advertising, except television – and by 2018 it is projected to exceed even that medium. The IBM Institute for Business Value stated that “The next 5 years will hold more change for the advertising industry than the previous 50 did.” And we are distinctively positioned in the digital signage space.     With our unique screen placement, our form of advertising provides a business the ability to target their ads both demographically and geographically – something that is difficult to match through any other means. Today people are out and about all the time, living their busy lives, making it even more difficult to reach them via traditional advertising media - and digital signage advertising has stopping power. The OTX study determined that 63% of the people say digital signage catches their attention – more than any other medium. And it is not just that it catches their attention – but numerous studies show that people find it more interesting, unique, entertaining, and less annoying. More importantly, it has been shown that digital signage is more effective in driving people to action. And our screens are designed to provide interactive capabilities with each of its riders.","Advertising, Sales and Marketing",,,1-10,1,,,,,118000,USD,118000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

For 25 years GP has invested in sustainable solutions that help impoverished people increase their incomes and improve their lives, with core investments in livelihoods, education, health, energy, housing, and sanitation. Since inception GP has deployed $356.5 million in impact investments to 135 partners, bringing meaningful impact to over 14.7 million lives in 21 countries. What is Impact-First Investing? Impact-first investing means investing in a way that seeks the highest possible social impact, while seeking to preserve capital with a modest financial return for investors. Impact-first investing is distinctly different from return-first investing, which seeks the highest possible financial return (often without consideration of social or environmental consequences), and from philanthropy, which seeks the highest social impact without any preservation of capital. We believe that impact-first investing has an essential role to play in advancing sustainable solutions to poverty for millions of people worldwide. What Does Impact Mean to Global Partnerships? All of our impact-first investing is aimed at empowering poor and marginalized people to earn a living, provide the basic necessities of life for their families, and improve their lives. We seek social impact on four dimensions: Broadening Opportunity – We have a holistic understanding of poverty, so we invest across all facets of poverty: livelihoods, education, energy, health, housing, sanitation, and water. Deepening Inclusion – We invest at the edge of the market, emphasizing approaches that include people marginalized by depth of poverty, gender, and/or geography, including women and the rural poor. Serving Millions – We believe that every person matters, and want to expand opportunity for as many people as possible. We therefore focus on sustainable approaches that can, over time, scale to serve millions of people living in poverty. Improving Lives – We only invest where evidence convinces us that people living in poverty value the opportunity being delivered and are empowered by it – economically or otherwise – to improve their lives.","Financial Services, Other",2,"Bill Clapp, Paula Clapp",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
