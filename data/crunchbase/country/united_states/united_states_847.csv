My name is Nick Montoya and I believe that with some help I can build many affordable, green, energy efficient homes in Santa Fe, New Mexico. I am priced significantly lower than my  competition.  I have been in construction since 2006 and have already built over 100 houses, 52 over the past two years. My newest homes have a HERS rating of 60. To give you some idea what that means, a house with a HERS score of 70 is 30 percent more energy efficient than a standard new home. My problem is that because of the economy, banks in Santa Fe are reluctant to lend to small builders like me. I currently have six homes pre-sold but I cannot get construction loans. I have contacted other banks, credit unions, and private investors but the interest rates they charge would make it impossible for me to build affordable homes. I still have to pay interest payments on the undeveloped land. So right now, we're struggling. That's why I decided to turn to crowdfunding. Your donation will help me buy materials and construct the pre-sold homes. I can build 10 houses for $1 million and 5 houses for $500 thousand.

PitBullTax achieves automation by allowing ""taxpros"" to: - Gather information about the case fast and precisely. We use a client questionnaire, chat and document exchange for that.    - Get precise figures by requesting clients' tax transcripts from IRS servers using their e-Services accounts. All data is analyzed and processed by PitBullTax to generate sevearl reports. - Find in one single screen whether a client is eligible for an Installment Agreement, and Offer in Compromise, First Penalty Abatement or Currently Non-Collectible status. This information can be confirmed with other tools in the software. - Once the tax professional has decided a resolution path for a client, PitBullTax will provide and pre-populate the forms needed for the formal representation of the client. All he needs to do next is to review the documents, have his client sign the pertaining documents, and carry out the formal representation before IRS. PitBullTax goes further and also provides tools to: - Whitelabel all documents and reports - Sign forms online via DocuSign - Calculate a tax resolution case professional fees - Create invoices and even charge them online - Get notifications every time something changes in a client’s IRS account - Start or schedule Zoom meetings with clients - Integrate PitBullTax with other software via Zapier or its API - Backup the information to their OneDrive, Google Drive of Dropbox accounts.

In 2002, CiviTek launched MyFloridaCounty.com to provide online child support and traffic citation payments for Clerk constituents and was the first of its kind anywhere in the nation. Since 2008, CiviTek has taken its experience in the Clerk’s office and expanded its services to all types of Florida local governments, including cities, special districts, and other state government agencies (i.e., Supreme Court, Department of Law Enforcement, etc.). It wasn’t long before CiviTek determined it could benefit agencies in other states.

Within all tumors there exists a diverse mix of immune cells. In particular their company is interested in T cells and their function within tumor-bearing hosts.  Some of these T cells are responding to new or overly expressed antigens that a tumor produces and are capable of destroying the tumor.  Others are actively shutting down the immune response to protect healthy tissue.  This dynamic and complex relationship is ongoing in the tumor microenvironment and is unique relative to blood.  For this reason we are in the process of identifying new immunotherapy targets by understanding the complexity of human tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) isolated from several different tumor types.  Through our close alignment with the Earl A Chiles Research Institute at the Providence Cancer Center we have evaluated over a hundred tumor specimens obtained from surgery.  We process these samples as soon as they are obtained from the operating room in order to keep the immune phenotypes intact, which avoids changes that can occur during freezing or resting.  Differences in RNA array data have identified genes that are upregulated in either the activating and suppressive immune populations within the tumor microenvironment.  From this information they design and develop recombinant proteins, antibodies, or small molecules that block and/or activate novel immune-specific pathways.  These agents are currently being tested in a battery of immune-specific in-vitro human assays and in mouse tumor models with the ultimate goal of treating cancer patients. They believe these new agents will add to the toolbox that oncologist have to treat and cure cancer.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
