The project studies the technical challenges that must be addressed to validate NDN as a future internet architecture: routing scalability, fast forwarding, trust models, network security, content protection and privacy, and fundamental communication theory. The NDN secures the contents, a design choice that decouples trust in data from trust in hosts, enabling several radically scalable communication mechanisms such as automatic caching to optimize bandwidth. By naming data instead of their locations, it transforms data into a first-class entity. The project uses end-to-end testbed deployments, simulation, and theoretical analysis to evaluate the proposed architecture, and develops specifications and prototype implementations of NDN protocols and applications. NDN Technical Report NDN-0001 “Named Data Networking (NDN) Project” is a slightly modified version of the NDN project proposal.

Together, the brands now make up The Who’s There Group, where McDowell serves as equity partner and SVP of strategy, while remaining the creative director of Emily Em & Friends.
