Reality Sports was founded and is led by two former NFL team employees who have specialized experience in football operations, football administration, legal administration, and interpretation of professional sports collective bargaining agreements.  Reality Sports aims to provide fantasy users with a realistic and engaging online general manager experience by simulating the front office operations of a professional sports franchise through its sophisticated yet easy to use platform. Our Company’s mission is to pioneer, and become synonymous with, a new category of fantasy sports by developing realistic front office platforms across multiple professional sports, which provide customers with an unparalleled user experience. Reality Sports currently offers a fantasy football front office platform (the “Football Platform”), which allows real participants to build and manage their fantasy teams like an NFL general manager while competing against other league members during the NFL season. The Football Platform's most innovative feature is our Free Agency Auction software, which facilitates up to 32 fantasy owners to simulate NFL Free Agency over the course of 3-4 hours instead of 3-4 months. During the Free Agency Auction, the owners build their respective teams by negotiating with and signing players to single and/or multi-year contracts in real-time online. An algorithm thinks and acts as the Player's Agent/Player Intelligence, instantaneously fielding and valuing offers of various lengths and amount (see image below of the Free Agency Auction Room). Other key features of the Football Platform include a rookie draft with slotted contracts based on draft selection, partially guaranteed contracts, a salary cap based on NFL rules, use of a franchise tag, Injured/Reserve, and much more.   Reality Sports was the winner of the 2012 Fantasy Sports Trade Association (“FSTA”) Rookie of the Year award and a finalist for the 2012 FSTA Most Innovative Product or Service Award.","Gaming, Internet Services, Sports",2,"Matt Papson, Stephen Wendell",1-10,2,Seed,301750,USD,301750,301750,USD,301750,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Within the law enforcement community, which spends over 100 billion annually, there is no efficient method to decrease ‘rubbernecking’ and ensure privacy from public view. The SRN 1000 is the first barrier of its kind that is durable yet light-weight and able to be set up by one person and break down into a small compartment. The SRN 1000 allows first responders or other law enforcement personnel to quickly and easily obstruct the view of onlookers during traffic accidents, crime scenes, or other sensitive matters such as vehicle searches.  Customer Problem: Having and maintaining privacy and safety is a growing concern. Albeit traffic accidents, searches, crime scenes, deaths, film making, emergency management, crowd control, or disaster areas. An escalating lack of privacy for sensitive incidents creates strain and undue criticism on law enforcement personnel to conduct operations. In addition, rubbernecking from traffic accidents causes hours of delays, congestion, and consequent accidents. Target Market: Law Enforcement – highway patrol, local & state police, crime scene units; Federal government – FEMA, DHS, DoD; emergency responders, news & media, entertainment, airports, hotels, schools, and sporting stadiums. Sales & Marketing Strategy: Focused effort within law enforcement industry. Strategy includes direct sales, brand awareness, conferences & trade shows, and an intense development of resellers and distributors.  Gross margins range from 30-55% based on the type of sales channel and quantity purchased.  Use of Funds: There are three main uses for capital: 1) increase inventory to keep up with demand, 2) fuel sales & marketing efforts, 3) execute next stage growth efforts. Competitive Advantage: Our products are proprietary, in large demand due to growing concerns, and cater to numerous market segments.",Privacy and Security,,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Complete blood count (CBC) is a medical test for infections, anemia and many other illnesses, in need by 10-30% patient visits. Over 600 million CBC are tested in US each year (Medicare reimbursement $10.58). However, current technologies are qualified only for central labs, while many physician offices could not afford to operate such a lab. There is a high demand of a simple-to-use technology for CBC test (categorized as “CLIA waived” by FDA). To address this market, CytoChip develops a disposable cartridge technology, which is distinct from current CBC products and suitable for decentralized test. The CytoChip cartridge uses only one drop of blood from fingerstick and two minute to complete the CBC test. With this product, not only doctors are able provide better care for patients but also it becomes financially sustainable to provide decentralized CBC tests. Currently there are over 250,000 such decentralized labs in physician offices and pharmacy clinics.
