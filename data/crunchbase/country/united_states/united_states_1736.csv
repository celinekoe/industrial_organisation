It is a beverage using honey as the fermentable base. Wine uses grapes. Beer uses barley malt. Mead uses honey. It has many styles and varieties. It may be sweet, medium or dry and can be served still or sparkling like champagne. Mead made with fruits is called a melomel and mead made with herbs/spices is called a metheglin. Is it a beer? NO! Is it a wine? NO! - It is it's own unique beverage and is undergoing a resurgence in popularity and growth.

We will be breaking new ground with our meads as they are neither a craft beer or a flavored spirit but something totally unique and different and at 14% alcohol content it packs a pretty good punch.
