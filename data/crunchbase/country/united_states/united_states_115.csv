Students of business, education and nursing also have these opportunities. Decisions on admissions are delivered within two weeks of receiving an application. Determining factors include past scholastic record, potential intellectual development and present motivation.

Or skip the meeting altogether, and be on the slopes in Tahoe by 8:40 AM for $100 round-trip, and back home the same evening. We are a land of towns and communities, many with airports, but few with regular air service. Our stock of 13,500 airports is the largest in the world, yet just 140 of the largest hubs carry over 97% of air traffic. This has left many of us with long drives to catch a flight, while on shorter trips we skip air travel altogether. Communities without good air service also struggle to attract investment and create jobs. Electric aircraft of varying sizes are ideally suited to this critical need, requiring little support other than a GPS flight path and a quick recharge or swap facility on the tarmac. Be it Moses Lake, Beaumont, Santa Fe or Butte: prepare for the convenience of frequent electric air service. Did you know that short-haul flights produce over 40% of aviation emissions? With our aircraft, we believe these will be largely eliminated within twenty years.

The result of neglected and aging grid infrastructure, our founder sought a way to circumvent the grid altogether. He applied his 30+ years of experience in electric motor and battery technology to develop a compact yet robust microgrid system—a system that enables residential and commercial consumers alike to become grid independent and maximize the ROI on their solar, wind and hydro energy investments.  Personal experience and extensive research have led us to the conclusion that the prevailing battery backup solutions on the market are not cutting it. These sub-15 kWh systems provide little more than half-a-days power to the average American home, which consumes 30 kWh/day. Something more is needed. Like most people, our founder knew that he would never possess the massive solar arrays and battery storage to make sustainable living possible. He also personally felt the expense burden of generators and energy storage devices that cost him thousands of dollars up front, and thousands more in fuel and energy rationing down the road. With a breached pain threshold, he set out to make a change.  That change was Blue Power Systems. Offering a patent-pending, state-of-the-art hybrid microgrid system, BPS provides users a new solution—a self-sufficient unit that supports the average American home without energy rationing and without exorbitant fuel costs. The system keeps users energy independent by relying on multiple energy sources: renewable energy (such as solar, wind or hydro), grid energy (if available/whenever it’s cheap), and also generator energy (which charges the system batteries directly). Grid down? Use your generator and solar. Solar panels not working? Use your wind turbine and grid charge. Alternatives make our product practical.  Blue Power Systems is unique because of our hybrid approach, efficient generator system, and greater battery capacity. Typical generators run 24 hours (27.5 gallons/day) to power a home, releasing energy that may or may not get used while constantly emitting harmful gasses and particulate matter. Blue Power Systems runs its generator for 2.5 hours (2.875 gallons/day) to accomplish the same job; that’s 90% less fuel, 90% less pollution.  Further, our units include a revolutionary BLADE exhaust filter that are lab-proven to reduce PM 2.5 by 72% as well as Carbon Monoxide and Carbon Dioxide by 12%––meaning that our already efficient generation system has even more environmental protections in place. To top it off, 64 decibels at 20 feet make us quieter than a standard AC unit. An intuitive system control center enables users to customize their needs: renewable energy priority, cost priority, etc. The intelligent algorithms present both immediate and predictive data to the user via an elegant mobile phone app, which also displays real-time data collection concerning energy storage/usage/production.  People are beginning to look elsewhere as centralized power continues to falter. Blue Power Systems is not just a product, we're a movement.","Energy, Natural Resources, Sustainability",1,Ray Caamano,1-10,2,Early Stage Venture,205000,USD,205000,205000,USD,205000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The Problem: Medical records are often inaccurate, incomplete, and difficult to access for both doctors and patients. This can lead to errors in diagnosis and treatment, and can also make it difficult for patients to manage their own care. Our Solution: Arnaque is developing a platform that uses AI to help doctors and patients record medical record information more accurately, efficiently, and accessibly. The platform will use natural language processing to understand the context of medical conversations, and will then generate structured data that can be easily stored and retrieved.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Financial Services, Health Care, Software",,,1-10,1,Seed,175000,USD,175000,175000,USD,175000,,,,,Private,,,,,,
