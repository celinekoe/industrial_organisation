Forté differs from other ""traditional"" buying groups by the fact that its shareholder dealers and preferred vendors recognize that more is not necessarily better, but better is better. Forté's membership approach accounts for the unique nature of limited distribution products sold in decorative plumbing and hardware showrooms. That is the reason why Forté has been able to attract market leaders in most of the metropolitan regions in the United States and Canada. Forté's appreciation for limited distribution is the reason why leading manufacturers elect to serve as Forté Preferred Vendors.Forté's mission is to remain the buying group in the decorative plumbing and hardware industry. By aggregating the purchasing power of more than 250 of the leading showrooms throughout the United States and Canada, Forté levels the playing field for independent dealers by negotiating cash discounts, preferred pricing and rebate levels that are equal if not superior to those offered to publicly traded big boxes and multibranch retailers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Unlike the competing media server products of the 2000s, Sooloos didn't just solve the infrastructure problems of content import, storage, and streaming. Its product offering was uniquely focused on the user experience of browsing and listening to music, with an emphasis on graphically rich and tactile user interface available on a dedicated 17"" touch panel device. Sooloos developed elegant solutions to a variety of product and technical problems including media backup, remote system health monitoring, audio analysis for crossfade and volume leveling, music recognition and metadata retrieval, high-performance GUI rendering, and low-latency audio streaming.
