Since 2008, our line of high-quality apparel has infused the bygone glamour of the past into modern styles, bringing an air of luxury and sophistication to everyday life. We offer the highest quality men’s and women’s fashion, specializing in fine leather handbags, shoes and other accessories.  At VINTIK & Co., we believe that vintage is a way of life and luxury is a state of mind, less about recreating the style of one time period and more about honoring the graceful extravagance of fashion history. Our styles live somewhere between the cool sophistication of Grace Kelly and the head-turning playfulness of Sophia Loren, with the swagger of Bogart.  VINTIK is not about flash. Our line of men’s and women’s apparel is designed to begin with the sensibility of luxury and then use it to accent the world of your daily life. Our modern leather accessories will turn heads, but fit comfortably in an office meeting or a dinner party. Always evolving with relevant designs, our seasonal collections keep up with the evolving style of the modern urbanite while retaining timeless elegance. VINTIK is also about the highest standards of craftsmanship. We cherish the era when robust goods were crafted with the utmost care and meticulous attention to detail. We strive to make our products with a look and feel of old word artisanship, with every cut and stitch executed with care.  Leather, in Rare Form  l  We love leather. There’s no other material that makes such a statement, but carries such a wide array of meanings and potential. Leather can be strong and masculine, a symbol of work and rugged durability. But it’s also delicate, with a soft touch and subdued tones. It can convey whatever the designer and the wearer are willing to put into it. At VINTIK, we specialize in making the most of leather, honoring its tradition, but taking it to new places. We use only the finest starting product, in the tradition of the old world Italian craftsmen. We then draw out its beauty with soft, muted colors, classic black, and the occasional burst of red. Whether a handbag, formal or casual shoes, or other accessories, our leather products complete your look. Women  l  Picture the celebrity photography of Richard Avedon, and how he captured both the glamour and everyday nature of icons like Elizabeth Taylor or Audrey Hepburn. Their uniqueness shines through, but they exude comfort and approachability. This is the balance we strive for in our women’s wear. VINTIK’s vintage dresses are one of a kind, whether you’re headed to a cocktail party or a dinner out.  We’re perhaps best known for our fine leather handbags and shoes for women.  We offer relaxed flats in warm earth tones or sleek black, or our more formal, strappy or solid-piece high heels, and even bold stilettos. And when the occasion demands, don’t be afraid to go knee length now and then. VINTIK has an abiding love for shoes, and we’ve created a timeless line of footwear to simultaneously bring out a woman’s grace and strength. Our handbags and travel bags convey the romance of world travel. With a similar style as our line of women’s shoes, VINTIK’s bags are truly unique, with splashes of color that provide a punch to any look. Men  l  VINTIK’s line of men’s accessories is for the man who has cast himself as the hero in the movie of his life. Bold but still grounded, our men’s collections stand out from the crowd. Our collection of jackets and ties add the perfect, unique accent to the classic look, formal or casual. Sleek black and white leather and narrow cuts are plucked from 1940s Milan. Mint Condition  l  In addition to our main line, VINTIK’s sister brand, Mint Condition, takes the same aesthetic of vintage and modern styles, at the best value available. We believe every customer should have the best in fashion and quality, and Mint Condition loosens our tie a bit, while still delivering on that pledge.   World-Class Customer Service  l  Last, but certainly not least of our concerns, is providing you the best service available. Our online purchasing system is convenient and easy to use, and our staff is responsive to your needs.","Clothing and Apparel, Community and Lifestyle, Consumer Goods, Design, Food and Beverage",1,Omar AV,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
