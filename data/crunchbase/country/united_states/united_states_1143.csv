These markets are growing 50 percent faster than the national average. In each of its daily newspaper markets, McClatchy operates the leading local website, offering readers information, comprehensive news, advertising, e-commerce and other services. The McClatchy Company dates to the California Gold Rush era of 1857, when James McClatchy was one of the founding editors of its first newspaper, The Sacramento Bee -- one of the oldest newspapers in the West. Coverage of California's Central Valley expanded with the founding of The Fresno Bee in 1922 and the purchase of The Modesto Bee in 1927. For more than a century, California was the cornerstone of the company. In 1979, McClatchy expanded into the Northwest with the purchase of the Anchorage Daily News and the Tri-City Herald in Kennewick, Wash. In 1986, The News Tribune in Tacoma, Wash., was added to McClatchyâ€™s growing family of newspapers. The company went public in February 1988 and its Class A common shares are listed on The New York Stock Exchange under the symbol MNI. The companyâ€™s Class B common stock, which controls a majority of shareholder voting power, is not publicly traded. In 1990, McClatchy began publishing on the East Coast with the purchase of three daily newspapers in South Carolina: The Herald in Rock Hill, The Island Packet on Hilton Head Island, and The Beaufort Gazette. In 2004, McClatchy purchased the Merced Sun-Star and five affiliated non-dailies in Californiaâ€™s Central Valley. The newspapers, situated between Modesto and Fresno, serve a fast-growing region and provided a good strategic fit with McClatchyâ€™s other Central Valley papers. In 2006, McClatchy purchased Knight Ridder Inc. to become the second-largest newspaper publisher in the United States. Of Knight Ridderâ€™s 32 daily newspapers, McClatchy immediately announced its intentions to sell 12 that didn't fit its longstanding acquisition philosophy of buying newspapers in fast-growing markets. The 20 daily newspapers retained in the Knight Ridder acquisition were: The Tribune in San Luis Obispo, Calif.; The Bellingham Herald and The Olympian in Washington; The Idaho Statesman in Boise; The Kansas City Star in Missouri; The Olathe News and The Wichita Eagle in Kansas; the Fort Worth Star-Telegram in Texas; the Belleville News-Democrat in Illinois; the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer and The Telegraph in Georgia; the Sun Herald in Biloxi, Miss.; the Lexington Herald-Leader in Kentucky; the Centre Daily Times in Pennsylvania; The Miami Herald, Bradenton Herald and El Nuevo Herald in Florida; The Charlotte Observer in North Carolina; and The Sun News and The State in South Carolina. As part of its analysis of the Knight Ridder acquisition, McClatchy sold the Star Tribune in 2007. The sale of its largest newspaper made McClatchy the third-largest newspaper publisher in the United States. In 2008, The Olathe News converted from daily publication to twice-weekly.","Advertising, Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment",1,James McClatchy,5001-10000,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,2,Public,1998-02-12,,,MNI,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/the-mcclatchy-company-ipo--dfb52868,NYSE - New York Stock Exchange

Founded in 2009 by entrepreneurs with experience in the grocery industry, the Company’s mission is to bring high-quality, farm-fresh food direct to consumers at wholesale prices. Rather than work through distributors, warehouses and grocery store channels, Zaycon fills its trucks with food sourced from the farm based on pre-order demand and delivers the food directly to the customer, thus preserving freshness, taste and nutrition. Zaycon’s customers pre-order their food choices online and then pick up their orders at pre-determined local locations (often large and centrally-located parking lots). Furthermore, by removing the middlemen, Zaycon is able to offer the lowest prices, providing customers with savings of up to 50% compared to prices at traditional grocery stores. In addition, Zaycon’s proprietary business model requires no fixed assets, no warehousing and zero waste all while collecting up-front customer payments prior to delivery. The Company currently offers a wide range of fresh foods including poultry, beef, pork, seafood and fresh fruit and delivers to more than 1,200 locations – through ~7,000 sales events – across 48 states. Zaycon is well positioned for rapid growth within the fast-growing online grocery market. An independent third party consulting study estimates that the online grocery whitespace represents more than 35 million potential customer households in the U.S. Since inception, the Company has quickly expanded its national footprint and grown its customer base to more than 120,000 purchasing customers to date (100%+ growth per annum since 2010). The ~105,000 households that participate in Zaycon’s sales events represent a penetration rate of less than one percent. The Company’s current infrastructure has the capacity to serve more than 80% of the U.S. population representing a significant growth opportunity with further penetration into the Company’s target market. Additionally, average sales per customer have increased 250% since 2010 as customers continue to purchase with higher frequency and higher spending per order. Along with ongoing grassroots marketing efforts, recently adopted online marketing campaigns have shown exceptional early success and present an opportunity to exponentially grow the Zaycon brand name and customer base.","Administrative Services, Commerce and Shopping",1,Mike Conrad,51-100,1,Seed,2500000,USD,2500000,2500000,USD,2500000,"Saratoga Equity, Michael Giunta",,2,,Private,,,,,,

ARMA Global Corporation (ARMA) was built to support the most complex programs within Special Operations Forces (SOF). General Dynamics (GD) is a worldwide powerhouse offering a broad portfolio of products and services in aerospace, combat vehicles, weapons systems, shipbuilding, and information technology. ARMA Global is now a wholly owned subsidiary of GD, and the ARMA and GD combination delivers the best of both worlds: ARMA’s SOF focus, agility, and proven SOF performance united with GD’s diverse and extensive background in delivering world-class services in designing and building everything from nuclear submarines to advanced C4 systems. A responsive SOF mission-focused team with tremendous resources, they bring to the table exactly what their customers require. At ARMA, they have always mirrored the performance of an outstanding SOF unit. This is not surprising given the high percentage of former SOF operators and leaders that guide their company. They grew up serving in SOF as commanders, operators, intelligence officers, logisticians, signal officers, and in many civilian and defense contracting industry roles. They continue to run as a unique business entity within GD; however, now their company’s portfolio of products, services, resources, and expertise have expanded greatly with GD’s extensive expertise in defense intelligence, acquisitions, platform weapon systems, logistics, ship-building, munitions, and communication information technology systems.",Other,2,"James Fugit, Todd Schweitzer",501-1000,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
