The revolutionary healthy ceramic nonstick cookware line is award-winning, features groundbreaking technology, and is sustainably built and toxin-free (free of PFAS, PFOA, lead, and cadmium).  We’re the creators of the original healthy ceramic nonstick coating called Thermolon™, which starts with sand. This plastic-free nonstick is the first alternative to traditional nonstick coatings.  Evershine™, an electro-chemical surface treatment, is applied to GreenPan stainless steel cookware to keep it looking brighter and brand new. And our Magneto™ technology, a thick base with copper-reinforced ferromagnetic particles, helps optimize the induction power of any pan.  At GreenPan, we’re committed to a greener future. Our products are crafted in our eco-friendly GreenPan-owned factory and produced with 30% solar power, 60% less CO2 during the curing phase, and at least 70% recycled aluminum (excluding handles). Additionally, our company owns a wastewater management facility to treat and reuse the water used in production.  Our company holds over 150 patents for technological advancements that help make the culinary experience easy for those just starting their cooking journey and those proficient in the kitchen.  GreenPan’s roster of products includes frypans, woks, griddles, Dutch ovens, roasters, ovenware and bakeware, slow cookers, and cutlery.  Our Valencia Pro collection won the 2023 Good Housekeeping Sustainable Innovation Award, Popular Science Best Eco-Friendly Induction Cookware Award, and made The Spruce Eats Best Eco-Friendly Nonstick Cookware Brands list.
