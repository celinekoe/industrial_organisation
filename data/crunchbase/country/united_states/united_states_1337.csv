However, it has a much harder time answering the question, “Which developer is interested?” That’s the kind of question that we answer.  We do this by collecting the latest needs and haves from 296 million professionals. We match these needs according to the latest haves. Then we display the card stack of most interested people to fulfill your need. Our topics run from funding to hiring with customers, marketing, developers, PR, freelancer, designers, business partners, and dozens of other subjects along the way.
