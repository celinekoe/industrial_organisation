The Dominiqart collection draws much of its inspiration from Zabczyk’s childhood in Cracow, Poland, where she soaked up the old culture and beautiful architecture. As a child, Zabczyk knew that one day she wanted to be an architect herself. So, she pursued that dream and earned a Master’s degree in Architecture and Design.  Zabczyk then worked for almost ten years in architecture and interior design. She enjoyed designing and drafting, but her favorite part was being able to draw or sketch. Drawing and dreaming brought back memories of her childhood, and she realized she really missed that.  Zabczyk felt an urge to express herself in art. The talented Sarasota artist couldn't ignore that voice anymore, so one day she bought supplies and started painting. Thus, Dominiqart was born. Dominiqart’s central theme is nature. Zabczyk couldn’t get enough of it, especially now, when the real world is rapidly being replaced with the artificial. Through her collection, Zabczyk wants to show people the natural beauty of our home, the Earth. She embraces the textures, soft shapes, and diversity of our home planet. Studying nature helps her recreate it in her paintings.  Zabczyk’s favorite mediums at this moment are epoxy resin and acrylic paint, but she also uses pastels, textiles, and plaster. Zabczyk had a very successful collection inspired by drone pictures taken at the Gulf Coast. After the collection sold out, she wanted to explore other parts of the Earth seen from above. That's how her most recent collection started. It's very earthy, abstract, and has a muted color palette.  Additionally, Zabczyk recently created a Limited Edition Surfboard collection. It was a Dominiqart show stopper during an art exhibition at Art Ovation in April this year. In this collection were five surfboards with portraits of endangered animals that are about to go extinct. Through this collection, she wanted to raise awareness about this crisis and call to action. """,,,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

This innovation-drain is a lost opportunity for the local economy to benefit from the jobs, creativity and investement that flow from the our world renowned  research institutions.  The Berkeley Startup Cluster was formed to address this innovation drain. Proximity to the UC Berkeley campus is one a key attribute of the Berkeley Startup Cluster.  But Berkeley has many other features that make it attractive for high growth technology firms. Sixty-nine percent of Berkeley residents have a bachelor’s degree or higher.  Access to BART, public transportation and great bike accessiblity, make Downtown Berkeley easy to get to. Not to mention nearly 100 restaurants in the Downtown alone. While focused on technology-oriented startups, the Berkeley Startup Cluster also encompasses tech-oriented established companies — as these companies are effectively brand name, anchor tenants of the BSC. In addition to giving credibility to the BSC, these established companies provide the funding that supports the BSC community-building events.
