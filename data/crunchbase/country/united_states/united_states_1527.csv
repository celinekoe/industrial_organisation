Neotopica,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/neotopica,Big Data,"Sebastopol, California, United States",Neotopica is a start-up developing an online suite of knowledge driven decision support services.,"3,086,183","San Francisco Bay Area, West Coast, Western US",Less than $1M,Closed,2009-01-01,year,,,,none,For Profit,http://www.neotopica.com,"Neotopica is Big Data start-up effort currently developing an online suite of knowledge driven decision support services based on knowledge extraction from historical and real-time worldwide news and information sources. The initial focus is on risk reduction for large, costly, complex, high risk, cross disciplinary projects such as renewable energy and sustainability. The technology, however,  is inherently cross-domain and can be applied to defense, health-care, biomedical, scientific, political, social or other domains. The objective is to raise project success rates by providing highly tailored parametric data on public perceptions, cost, success rates, vendors, technologies, technology readiness levels, geolocations, econometrics, regulatory, environmental and safety.  Large, complex, technology intensive projects such as renewable energy farms, smart grids, sustainable communities/cities, border surveillance, large scale IT systems, and defense systems have historically poor success rates (Chaos Report, Standish Group 2009). Only 32% are completed on-time and on-budget with all planned features and functions. 44% are completed and operational but are over budget, have slipped schedules or complete restarts, and have fewer features and functions than originally specified. 24% are cancelled at some point during the project life-cycle and never restarted. US$ billions are lost in failed and restarted projects every year as a result. By introducing a decision support and simulation step between conventional design and implementation, we have shown that significant risk reduction can be achieved by capturing lost requirements, revealing hidden costs, identifying technologies with low technology readiness levels, flagging environmental impacts, project side-effects, and more. An example use case is a municipal leader launching a waste-to-energy program to create jobs, increase revenue, foster growth, and improve community sustainability. Typically the municipal leader is not a technical expert but must make the call between competing vendors where cost, experience, technology readiness, environmental impact, safety and other considerations must be quickly mastered.  A graphic recent example of this nearly universal problem is the recent cancellation of Boeing's Secure Border Initiative (SBI), a high tech border monitoring project designed to automate border surveillance for US DHS. Originally bid at for 1,969 miles of protection, the project was cancelled after expending $1.1 billion (initial phase budgeted at US$67 million) and covering just 53 miles for slipped schedule, cost overruns and poor performance of the technology. The daily global news is full of examples of similar technology intensive projects being cancelled or restarted. The technology, however, is horizontal and can be applied to medical, technological, political, commercial, or other domains. It has a fundamental built-in capability of automated crowd building, achieved by sourcing large amounts of ""actionable"" knowledge to customer communities. For example, a company manufacturing sports footwear could use this technology to foster and grow large customer communities by providing ""sports centric"" as opposed to ""product centric"" actionable knowledge. Knowledge that helps the customer achieve success (in a holistic sense) in their activity, be it marathon running, triathlete competition, or other intensive sports activities. At the entry level, mined information from news, search engine, web site, conventional media, and social media sources is filtered, clarified, de-noised, categorized, tagged, and republished as enhanced domain specific news in social media environments to drive automated crowd building. Injected news links back to the decision support site where at a deeper level retrospective knowledge repositories provide role based decision support for social augmented cognition. User roles including investor, educator, researcher, industrial, media, municipal, leadership, consumer, trainer, etc. can be specified to extract finer grained knowledge perspectives. Deeper levels support project specific knowledge discovery and aggregation. The first demonstration of top level data republishing can be viewed in Twitter @SustainableNet. In just under 90 days the synthesized content achieved over 1,000,000 page impressions per day in controlled experiments. The channel remains open today in a daily release mode and continues to grow. Over 60 categories of energy and sustainability news are re-interleaved and delivered through this channel with temporal content structure imposed. Neotopica technology is an augmentation to major search engines such as Google, not a competitor. Major search engines and social media environments are used to provide first pass, coarse grained, firehose ingest streams for Neotopica post processing. We are a knowledge extraction, crowd building and decision support solution as opposed to a conventional search solution. We are, in a sense, a potential fused hybrid model for future news, library, advertising and decision support. The underlying concepts and technologies have been explored and tested by the founders in various domains for over two decades, continuously refining the techniques across various domains and verticals including national intelligence, tactical intelligence, digital libraries, E-Commerce, biomedical & pharmaceutical, energy & sustainability, manufacturing, software development, and investing. The current Neotopica platform represents an aggregation of these resources in a virtualized, cloud based paradigm that can be delivered to globally distributed projects.",Data and Analytics,3,"Irv Beiman, Jon Hujsak, Peter Rowell",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The software, EnterpriseSMS®, was initially developed by Knight O’Connor and Associates in response to this opportunity.  It was based on an existing product that had been used by many Federal agencies over the preceding 15 years.  The software product was spun off to ICS, which was created to develop and market software for such very large integrated security solutions.  One of the areas of opportunity available for funding was airports, so ICS joined with market knowledgeable partners and Airport Systems Group was created to pursue that market.  Airport Systems Group worked with a variety of large integrators (Johnson Controls, Landis Gyr Powers, TRW Integrated Systems, Cochran Electric, National Guardian, Lewis Electric) to provide integrated security solutions for airports including Chicago O’Hare Airport, Seattle’s SEATAC, Houston Intercontinental Airport International Terminal, Hobby Airport, and Memphis International Airport.

We are a startup company, SmartCents LCC, based out of the Northern Virginia and DC Metro area. Our goal is to try to win the lottery jackpot together. The large the pool size creates a greater chance of winning the lottery. With large pool sizes, the chances of winning the lottery jackpot increase because of the large spread of tickets without increasing the amount of money you have to use on buying more and more tickets.  We buy tickets for our clients and enter them into the pool of their choice. We use our automated software that notifies our employees a purchase has been made for a client. Our employees then proceed to purchase and scan the ticket. The scanned ticket is entered into our database for auditing and the receipt is emailed to the purchaser. Our pools are open until a few hours before the official draw date, which allows time for last minute purchases. After the official lottery results are reported, our automated software assigns each member their winnings. Unlike traditional pools where the pool winnings are split evenly, here at Social Lotto Pool the pool winnings are split based on how much a member has contributed to the pool. For example, if member A buys 40 tickets and member B buys 10 tickets, there will be a total of 50 tickets in the pool. If the pool wins a total of $100, member A would receive $80 (40/50 or 80%) while member B would receive $20, based on the 20% equity member B owns. The concept is clear, the more tickets that are in a pool, the greater the likelihood of winning the jackpot. The catch 22, however, is the more tickets that are in a pool, the less equity you own of that pool. Therefore the system works similar to evolution, the more cooperative competition between members, the better everyone fairs buy increase the chances of winning the jack pot for everyone, even the person that entered only one ticket. However, if the person who bought only one ticket and that ticket happened to be the jackpot winning ticket, that person would only receive their percentage share of the pool. We feel it is important to remind everyone that we do not offer a lottery or lottery drawing; the tickets we purchase on behalf of our clients are tickets for the major lotteries such as Mega Millions or Power Ball. Many people try to gain an edge over the lottery and the simple fact is you CAN’T. The best way to increase our odds of winning is to play together!","Commerce and Shopping, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

With MorphInk files, download delays are reduced or eliminated and full motion rich media in any Web ad format become possible. Equally exciting, MorphInk is enabling an entirely new animation realm for the wireless Web, where the memory, energy, CPU capability, and bandwidth limitations require the perfect combination of compact files and economical playback. MorphInk already provides such a uniquely efficient combination, critical to applications on cell phones, PDAs and other wireless devices. MorphInk animation authoring tools are able to publish in their own compact format and in other current Web formats such as Flash (SWF) or Animated GIF, creating a flood of new high-quality animations to be published and shared across the Web and embedded in e-mails or presentations.","Hardware, Media and Entertainment, Mobile, Video",,,,1,Early Stage Venture,3000000,USD,3000000,3000000,USD,3000000,Quantum Fund,1,1,,Private,,,,,,
