Seeing the need for a better way to manage and collect solid waste in the United States Jay went all over Europe to see the different technologies that were being used. He visited areas with high water tables, close to bodies of water, cities, and theme parks. He found that the company NORD Engineering had the best system, and the owner of Nord Engineering is the EU patent holder to invest in and bring the technology to the United States. The first groundbreaking for the underground technology took place in Kissimmee, Florida. This was after two years of challenging work talking to City Management to get the system approved and installed. Since this type of technology has never been in the United States other approvals needed to be obtained for the truck to be allowed on the American roads by the Department of Transportation. The first unit became fully operational on April 19, 2016 in Kissimmee, Florida at Kissimmee City Hall. The underground technology offers many benefits to reshape the solid waste management systems in the United States. Eliminating garbage odors, the underground dumpster also prevents nuisance animals such as rats and bears from having access to the refuse, making it animal proof garbage. The system saves above ground space by being comparable to the capacity of approximately 15 large garbage cans. Storms and winds will not affect this system as it cannot blow over or float in a flood. The system contains all refuse which keeps it from blowing away and has a locking security feature to reduce illegal dumping.","Hardware, Information Technology, Science and Engineering, Software, Transportation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
