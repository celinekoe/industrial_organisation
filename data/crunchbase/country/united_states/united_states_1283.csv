Ayata,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ayata,"Analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Energy, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Predictive Analytics, Robotics, Software, Speech Recognition","Austin, Texas, United States","Ayata invented Prescriptive Analytics with hybrid data. Our software prescribes actions that produce better answers, faster.","205,109",Southern US,Less than $1M,Active,2009-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,http://ayata.com,"Artificial Intelligence, by itself, is not necessarily actionable. While predictions are insightful and useful, they often leave it up to humans to make decisions to take advantage of the foresight. Enter Ayata – our software combines Artificial Intelligence (the science of predictions) with Operations Research (the science of decision making). Ayata’s software predicts what’s ahead and prescribes how to take advantage of this predicted future, without disrupting other priorities. For critical processes at large corporations, Ayata's software ingests videos, images, sounds, text, and numbers - together - to continually predict performance metrics and prescribe how to improve this predicted performance.  Since more than 80% of the world's data is unstructured, any technology focused on improving future performance must be capable of taking into account ALL data - not just numbers and/or text - to generate accurate predictions and actionable prescriptions. Ayata’s software can and does.  In Oil & Gas, Ayata's software has modeled more than 14,000 horizontal shale wells from 6 leading operators in 4 major North American shale plays. Results include 9.8% increase in first year production, 100-day decrease in new well breakeven, and 24% increase in per well ROR. In Insurance, Ayata's software is predicting losses for auto and home insurance policies for all US customers of a ""Fortune 50"" Insurance company, and running their claims litigation process end-to-end. In High-Tech, Ayata's software helped Cisco Systems, Microsoft, Dell, and Juniper Networks improve Customer Service, Field Service, Retail Operations, and Parts Logistics.  Ayata already has 35 US Patents – 9 Issued – and 2 US Trademarks. Ayata’s inventions combine disparate scientific disciplines – such as Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Speech Recognition, Metaheuristics, and Operations Research – to predict what’s ahead and prescribe how to benefit from this future. Our technology architecture is inspired by the Central Nervous System (“CNS”) in the human body. The CNS orchestrates and controls most of the body’s activities even though such processes are rarely conscious. Ayata’s software does the same for complex, mission critical operations. Ayata’s Board of Advisors include prominent senior executives from Google, Chevron, BP, Deloitte, McKinsey, Barclays, and BHP Billiton. Ayata has been featured on Bloomberg TV (twice), HART Energy Conferences (four times), Deloitte Oil & Gas Conference, Deloitte PPMD Conference, Energy Makers Show, Oil & Gas Investor, E&P Magazine, WIRED, GigaOm, InformationWeek, Gizmodo, and other prominent media venues.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Energy, Hardware, Science and Engineering, Software",1,Atanu Basu,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Enthusiasts can enjoy the same top gear and knowledgeable sales staff as they have enjoyed in our stores for more than a generation.

You'll find that our competitors are dreaming of skiing or mountain biking in Seattle or New York City. We live our business and look forward to helping you live your dreams today. In 1958, two skiers decided they loved the sport so much, they would open up a ski shop on West Colfax Ave. Back in those days, Ed and Gale Crist spent their weekends rounding up their customers in a yellow bus to head for the ski slopes. Today, Christy Sports remains a company of skiers and riders who love to play. In the early 70's, we followed our hearts and opened stores at Copper Mountain and Vail. Being closer to the mountains meant we could be closer to the sport. The rest is pretty much history. Christy Sports now has over 40 locations throughout the Rocky Mountains. As a result, most of our employees are serious skiers and snowboarders who have a genuine desire to serve our customers. After so many years in the ski business we know that there's no such thing as the ""best equipment."" There's only the equipment that's best for you. Choosing the right gear requires a great deal of experience and a great selection of product. At Christy Sports, you'll find both. As serious skiers and riders, we take your complete satisfaction personally. That's why you won't find a thing in our stores that we haven't put to the test ourselves.
