"Smaller Than 500, Inc.",https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/smaller-than-500-inc,"Apps, Career Planning, Human Resources, Search Engine","San Diego, California, United States",Smaller Than 500 is a small company job search web app that helps small business owners and career searchers connect.,"3,070,053","Greater San Diego Area, West Coast, Western US",Less than $1M,Closed,2013-10-31,day,,,,none,For Profit,https://smallerthan500.com,"Mission Statement Smaller Than 500 has one simple goal, and that is to help small business owners and career searchers connect. The Inspiration Working for a large corporation can be discouraging, especially for those who have a strong work ethic and want to be more than just a “cog in the machine.” Politics and bureaucracy often become the deciding factors and common sense is thrown out the window. Fortunately, there will always be individuals who challenge the status quo. There will always be individuals who want to see their actions result in positive growth. These are the individuals who should be praised, not only for wanting to better the company despite the roadblocks, but for wanting to better themselves in the process. As defined by the Small Business Administration (SBA), most small businesses must have less than 500 employees (hence the name Smaller Than 500). Recent statistics show that small businesses make up more than 55% of all businesses in the United States. That’s potentially 23 million companies striving to hire and preserve a talented and passionate workforce. It is a monumental task for small businesses, especially startups, to hire employees. Bringing on new employees is not only expensive, but a major risk. It is crucial for small businesses to find individuals who are team players, and are passionate enough to share the load that accompanies the adventure of operating a small business. Smaller Than 500 was designed to do just that. Smaller Than 500 was developed to foster the initial relationship between small businesses and career searchers. We strive to help those who want to make a difference find the career that will enable them to do so. Just the same, we provide an outlet for small businesses to find the newest addition to their team. We hope that Smaller Than 500 is the answer you have been looking for in your search. How It Works (The Searcher) We encourage all those who want to work for a small business to register and create a profile. Once a candidate has registered, he or she will be able to apply for any job they wish. If you are in a time crunch, feel free to fill out and complete your profile later. Although being registered is not necessary to search for postings, it is required in order for one to apply. But don’t worry, it’s free! Small businesses will have the ability to contact an individual directly if career searchers choose to keep their profile contact information visible. (The Small Business) Small businesses that go through smallerthan500.com will initially create a profile page about their company. They must include a few statistics such as their approximate number of employees, what industry(ies) they are involved in, city of operation, etc. Once a business has created a profile page, they will be able to create job postings that will link to their profile. Registered career searchers will be able to apply through the job postings directly. Once an individual has applied, the small business can decide if they want additional information from the applicant, contact the applicant directly, or continue the search. Once a position has been filled, the small business can either remove the posting, or wait for it to expire after the indicated duration. Fees (For Searchers) There is no fee for career searchers to use the website. We want career searchers to stand out to small businesses, not because they have paid to wrap a banner around their profile, but because they have positively represented themselves as individuals who want to make a difference at their future company. (For Small Businesses) Small businesses will be able to create their company profile and search for candidates for free. Once a business has created their profile, they will be able to create a Basic job posting for free. If a business decides that they want additional value from their listing, they have the option to create a Premium listing for a nominal fee. Premium listings are packed with additional features such as: one month visibility, top search results, highlighted search results, and have the company logo appear next to the listing in the search results. Additional features to come! Involvement Smaller Than 500 is always looking for new and innovative ways to be involved with the community. If you would like to partner with smallerthan500.com or if you have a recommendation for other ways Smaller Than 500 can be involved, we would love to hear from you.  Promotions Be on the lookout for special promotions that will enable small businesses to create postings at reduced rates. Enter the promotion code before checkout in order to receive your discount. Continuous Improvement Like those who use smallerthan500.com, we too also believe in continuous improvement. Be on the lookout for site upgrades and new services for career searchers and small business alike as we continue to grow. If there is a service or feature you would like to see, we would love to hear your recommendation.","Administrative Services, Apps, Internet Services, Professional Services, Software",1,Aaron Kantrowitz,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Biopology delivers a report that provides a detailed action plan with steps to balance nutrition through an evaluation of blood and urine tests. This advanced procedure allows medical professionals to identify and address the root cause, rather than chasing symptoms. Biopologyâ€™s analysis typically includes an in-depth analysis of the balance and influence of one organ on another, what foods are best for each specific metabolic type, what nutritional food supplements would be beneficial in order to re-balance the bodyâ€™sâ€™ chemistry.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering, Sports",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Zenno provides commonly used protocols like Infrared, Wi-Fi and RF, supported by a rich, versatile and intuitively software platform and a Software Development Kit (SDK) for customizable extensions. Our device can also act as a thermostat and has real-time control over air conditioning units and all its functions. Home control hubs in the market today do not provide adequate integration to legacy appliance or device using Infrared (IR) as a mean of control, neglecting the most common home electronics: TV, non-smart media playback devices (sound system, dvd player, home cinema) and air conditioners, to name a few. Zenno addressed this one big limitation seamlessly. Alphid has a functional hardware and software platform today, along with the associated App on multiple mobile platforms. We are in the process of finishing up on high accuracy speech recognition, adding more Wi-Fi enabled devices to our database and are developing applications for Android Wear and Apple Watch devices. We are targeting consumers with the following profile: Male and female with technology-affinity, 25-40 years old, home owner, English speaking from North America with 3+ IR home electronics and has a smart phone device. Later we will include consumers with wearable devices. Because one of our most attractive features is voice control, first available in English, we will target first the US, Canada and the UK.
