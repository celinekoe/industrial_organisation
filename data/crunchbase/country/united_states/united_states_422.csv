It is S BRIEFs, and each S BRIEF is a short summary of key news, the assessment of their impact on the market and given assets over the last 4 hours within the system developed by T45, as well as real trades linked to a timestamp and exchange price. This ensures the credibility and public access to the system’s performance. One of the main features is that the company takes nothing under its management and the subscribers’ trading capital remains under control of the subscribers themselves. However they are united under a common strategy — S BRIEFs, a trading schedule and their discipline in execution. T45 expects on a reasonable basis that trading through S BRIEFs would generate income over the year as profitable as the world's best practices with an average drawdown providing the lowest possibility of losing investor's trading capital.","Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Financial Services, Information Technology, Other, Professional Services",1,Alexander Kiselev,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
