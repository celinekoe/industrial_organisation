Concurrently, Monolith will enable investors to create and manage their “Own Hedge Fund Portfolio”, via a compliant platform for primary offerings and secondary exchange transactions. The platform empowers investment advisors, accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers to help formulate their own market hypothesis. This allows the investor to create and manage their own “Personalized Hedge Fund Portfolio” in the alternative investment space from commercial real estate investments, asset-back securities, structured products, mature private PRE-IPO companies, etc. Ultimately, we are building four major revenue streams, with each stream having multiple revenue points and some having recurring revenue streams: Monolith Investment Banking, Monlith2 Real Markets, Monolith Investment Banking Structured Products, and Monolith Investment Banking Private Funds. We are building, where few exist today, an ecosystem that modernizes the capital markets using blockchain-digital-ledger technology and smart contracts via our own Digital Investment Bank and Capital Markets Firm. Our mission is to bring “liquidity rights” to alternative investments. We seek to modernize the primary and secondary capital markets for leading investors, issuers, and sponsors. We shall create compliant broker-dealer solutions for end-user secondary capital markets liquidity. Monolith will bring fair capital markets liquidity and a market value to the alternative investments space, versus the out dated mark-to-market value. Our fully-integrated platform solutions range from investment banking/broker-dealer/capital market services, proactive investor and shareholder administration and governance, and secondary market services via a dedicated compliant liquidity venue. Simply put, we use today’s technology through blockchain-digital-ledgers and digital smart contract technology, with the best practices of traditional finance. Our broad range of investment banking and financial advisory resources and solutions provide corporate and fund clients with origination, syndication, and administration solutions.

We utilize a fully-integrated end-to-end solution for issuers and sponsors to securely and transparently conduct primary and secondary digital securities offerings, along with digital securities reissuance. Digital smart contract securities help provide automated governance and streamline compliance for traditional and alternative investment instruments. A broad range of investors including asset managers will desire these modern securities for helping to assign “fair value” and possibly providing enhanced efficient liquidity solutions and markets. Fiduciary responsibility and pressure on behalf of traders, portfolio managers, regulators and the general industry could force an accelerated adoption of digital smart contract securities over owning their analog counterpart.Bank.

First of all, it means that they really are a company of educators.  Fully one-half of all their employees have spent significant portions of their careers as either classroom teachers, diagnosticians, therapists, school psychologists, administrators, or special education directors.  Even though they have stepped away from the campus, they work diligently to maintain their certifications and continuing education requirements.  They even have a member of a local school board on staff.   SuccessEd is a company of educators. The experience and perspective captured in the first half of their tagline allow us to successfully accomplish the second half.  They do what they do for educators–to improve their lives and the lives of the students and parents that they serve.  As former educators, they understand the challenges and pressures that are so often associated with their vocation.  Always mindful of this, they pour theirselves into their software solutions—developing tools that improve the quality of life of the educator and helping them spend less time with keyboards and more time with kids. The result of this powerful combination–educators building for educators–is a powerful, time-saving, easy-to-use set of data management tools.  SuccessEd software tracks compliance and services provided to students in special education, Section 504, RtI, Medicaid, ELL, and behavior programs.   Use of their programs results in actionable data that allows for continuous review of the effectiveness of implemented strategies, accommodations, and methodologies thereby creating opportunities for every student to be successful. At SuccessEd then, “Built by Educators, for Educators” is more than just a clever marketing tagline.  It captures who they are.  It reminds us of who they serve.  It informs everything that they do, every single day.","Consumer Electronics, Data and Analytics, Hardware, Software",,,11-50,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
