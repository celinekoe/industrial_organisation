For 7 years, MHA grew by selling DIY kits of premium automation systems to ambitious homeowners across the world. These systems were previously only been available through local third party integrators, nobody would sell to do-it-yourselfers. By 2011 MHA had grown into a very successful business, but an ominous new threat arose: boredom. In the seven years we sold automation systems, there were huge technological changes that seemed to hit every industry except ours. The advent of the iPhone, iPad, and HDTV changed the way we consumed media, but the home automation systems we sold had hardly changed at all. We still needed to login remotely any time a customer wanted to adjust a lighting scene or rename a music zone. Software updates were nearly impossible, clients were furious when they found out that $60,000 home automation system was not compatible with the next cool thing that came out a year later unless they dropped 5 grand on a new controller for the system. The UI’s were stale and difficult to navigate, and the systems were such a hassle to program and take advantage of that half the clients never touched them. Josh’s solution? He looked at these $100 million giants like Control4 and Crestron, and decided he could do better with a boatload of coffee and some clever programming. In 2012 he had a working prototype, but he completely scrapped it because he did not like the direction it was headed. Nimbus has been through more revisions since 2012 than I care to mention, but it’s reached a point now where our clients are very happy. We took the strengths of our competitors, added a beautiful and intuitive UI and some very unique features, and sell our Nimbus Home automation system across the country (and the globe) right out of our headquarters here in Denver.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Real Estate, Software",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

GunPro provides headlines of breaking news related to guns, legislation and litigation, and is published as frequently as such gun news subjects occur in the headlines of the nation’s (and some of the world’s) daily newspapers. Frequency is most often every day, less frequently as in three times per week or, rarely, in slightly longer durations. GunProPlus brings to the web viewer a wide variety of products to assure the Constitutional rights of Americans to self protection, home defense, recreational hunting and shooting. The world has become a dangerous place, and GunProPlus advocates for the preparation of citizens to support the efforts of law enforcement to protect and to serve the people of this great country. To do this, we combine breaking news of crime directed at individual Americans on a daily basis, supporting solutions to self protection and recreational shooting with selected products that work. We also pursue our mission by archiving gun-related headline stories from the country’s leading newspapers and magazines to better inform GunPro viewers of firearms activities that surround them, including news articles from infrequent international sources. Additionally, the firearms industry is an ever-evolving and fascinatingly complex universe, so we will bring you news of not only products but opinions of expert analysts with years of experience in observing and reporting on this industry’s manufacturing, legal and legislative activities. Viewers can be assured that the advertisers seen on these pages are as seriously committed as we are at GunProPlus to the safe and sane use of firearms and firearms training, ethics and responsibilities. We strongly solicit your support for our advertisers and their products.
