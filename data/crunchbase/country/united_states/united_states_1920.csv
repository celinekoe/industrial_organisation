Combined with the pressure stabilized vehicle, the engine allows for incredibly high propellant mass fractions.  The engine and propellant design dramatically improves safety while reducing launch costs. In order to monetize this new industry which we are creating, we will make most of our money through propellant sales; as repeat business is the most reliable revenue stream. Several years ago we started with a handful of novel ideas and began prototyping.  Today we have an engine system, two full scale vehicles in testing, and a portfolio of patentable, patent pending, and patented technology. Our next step is to enter the DARPA Launch Challenge (we have already perqualified), where we will be given $400K to continue development, and up to $12M more if we make our orbital launch goals.","Science and Engineering, Transportation",1,David Summers,1-10,1,,,,,,USD,,Creative Destruction Lab (CDL),,1,,Private,,,,,,
