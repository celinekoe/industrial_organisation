They’re successful entrepreneurs, CEOs and tech junkies that approach every investment as a team. They’ve been there before and know what it takes to evolve from startup to market success. Any investor can just throw money at your business, but what most startups need is a capital partner that commits as much sweat equity as they do dollars to your success. Led by their two founders, Paul Vlasic and Raymond Spencer, RSPV’s primary focus has leaned toward technology-based accelerators, green energy, and the health and sustainable living verticals. However, they are always drawn to any market disrupter regardless of industry because that’s where the real opportunities blossom. As experienced entrepreneurs theirselves, they know what it takes to drive innovation. They’re not interested in simply “running the numbers” or “doing deals.” Instead, they work tirelessly to support passionate entrepreneurs and guide their ideas into market-leading companies. RSVP Ventures finances early-stage and growth-stage companies meeting, at a minimum, all of the following criteria: - at least $1M in revenue - high gross margins - established leadership team - proven products with satisfied customers - an ability to scale rapidly - established co-investors - geographically located in the United States or Australia",,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
