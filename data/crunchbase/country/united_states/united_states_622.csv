After the death of one of his sons, S.R. retired from the apple business, selling the company to his remaining sons, John and Frederick, for $1. After John's death, Frederick sold the company, renamed Genesee Fruit Company, to the W.B. Duffy Cider Company for substantially more. In 1914, the two companies consolidated into the Duffy-Mott Company, Inc., a name that remained until it was shortened to simply ""Mott's Inc."" in 1986. Cadbury Schweppes acquired Duffy-Mott in 1982. The Cadbury Schweppes purchase ushered in a new age of innovation for the brand, and in 1985, Mott's was the first applesauce to come in single-serve plastic cups.

Antiwar.com,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/antiwar-com,News,"Redwood City, California, United States","Antiwar.com is a libertarian website which says it is devoted to ""non-interventionism"" and that it opposes imperialism and war.","519,419","San Francisco Bay Area, Silicon Valley, West Coast",$10M to $50M,Active,1995-12-01,day,,,,,For Profit,http://antiwar.com,"This site is devoted to the cause of non-interventionism and is read by libertarians, pacifists, leftists, ""greens,"" and independents alike, as well as many on the Right who agree with our opposition to imperialism. Our initial project was to fight against intervention in the Balkans under the Clinton presidency. We applied the same principles to Clinton's campaigns in Haiti and Kosovo and bombings of Sudan and Afghanistan. Our politics are libertarian: our opposition to war is rooted in Randolph Bourne's concept that ""War is the health of the State."" With every war, America has made a ""great leap"" into statism, and as Bourne emphasized, ""it is during war that one best understands the nature of that institution [the State]."" At its core, that nature includes an ever increasing threat to individual liberty and the centralization of political power.  Antiwar.com is one project of our parent foundation, the Randolph Bourne Institute. It is a program that provides a sounding board of interest to all who are concerned about U.S. foreign policy and its implications. In 1952, Garet Garrett, one of the last of the Old Right ""isolationists,"" said it well: ""Between government in the republican meaning, that is, Constitutional, representative, limited government, on the one hand, and Empire on the other hand, there is mortal enmity. Either one must forbid the other or one will destroy the other."" This is the perception that informs our activism and inspires our dedication. Non-interventionism abroad is a corollary to non-interventionism at home. Randolph Bourne echoed this sentiment: ""We cannot crusade against war without implicitly crusading against the State."" Since opposition to war is at the heart of our philosophy, and single-issue politics is the only avenue open to us, Antiwar.com embodies the politics of the possible. Our dedication to libertarian principles, inspired in large part by the works and example of the late Murray N. Rothbard, is reflected on this site. While openly acknowledging that we have an agenda, the editors take seriously our purely journalistic mission, which is to get past the media filters and reveal the truth about America's foreign policy. Citing a wide variety of sources without fear or favor, and presenting our own views in the regular columns of various contributors, we clearly differentiate between fact and opinion, and let our readers know which is which. The pressing need for ""citizen experts"" is the reason we set up Antiwar.com. In this process, the site evolved very quickly into an online magazine and research tool designed to keep the American people and the world informed about the overseas plans of the American government. The history of our site and of American foreign policy demonstrates the demand for such experts.  The founders of Antiwar.com were active in the Libertarian Party during the 1970s; in 1983, we founded the Libertarian Republican Organizing Committee to work as a libertarian caucus within the GOP. Today, we are seeking to challenge the traditional politics of ""Left"" and ""Right."" At present, none of the existing parties or activist groups offer an effective vehicle for principled libertarian politics. Yet even in the absence of a party of liberty, we cannot abstain from the struggle. We strive to lead the non-interventionist cause and the peace movements that many respected institutions have forgotten. Forged in the experience of the first Balkan war, Antiwar.com has become the Internet newspaper of record for a growing international movement, the central locus of opposition to a new imperialism that masks its ambitions in the rhetoric of ""human rights,"" ""humanitarianism,"" ""freedom from terror,"" and ""global democracy."" The totalitarian liberals and social democrats of the West have unilaterally and arrogantly abolished national sovereignty and openly seek to overthrow all who would oppose their bid for global hegemony. They have made enemies of the patriots of all countries, and it is time for those enemies to unite – or perish alone. Antiwar.com represents the truly pro-America side of the foreign policy debate. With our focus on a less centralized government and freedom at home, we consider ourselves the real American patriots. ""America first!"" regards the traditions of a republican government and non-interventionism as paramount to freedom – a concept that helped forge the foundation of this nation. THE FUTURE Antiwar.com is already fighting the next information war: we are dedicated to the proposition that war hawks and our leaders are not going to be allowed to get away with it unopposed and unchallenged. The War Party is well-organized, well-financed, and very focused. They know what they want: a renewal of the Cold War, increased military spending, and a globalist mission that would project American power from the Middle East to the Korean peninsula and all points in between. And they know how to get it: mobilizing special interest groups and key corporate allies in a propaganda war designed to win the hearts if not the minds of the American people. The antiwar forces, on the other hand, are not so well-positioned. Everyone is for peace, in theory at least, but there is no one group of Americans especially disposed to work for it, outside of small religious groups such as the Quakers and the Catholic Worker movement. Lacking a centrally coordinated leadership, without financial resources of any significance, and incredibly diverse, the organized opposition to the first Balkan war was unfocused and of limited effectiveness. Currently, the antiwar movement against a war on Iraq is considered anti-American and left-wing. However, we are changing this perception by leading the cause of the patriotic peace movement, which understands the true costs of war. Unfortunately, the organizations pushing for actions in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other areas around the world are stronger and better focused. Antiwar.com has become an integral part of the movement against these groups and for peace by disseminating accurate news and commentary. Antiwar.com is dedicated to building an awareness of the globalist and interventionist forces that would enslave us all in a New World Order on which the sun never sets.

The Classical German Training Methods are those taught by the old German Masters and perfected by some modern-day riders. These Methods are based on the Training Scale: Relaxation, Rhythm, Contact, Impulsion, Straightness, Collection. (Losgelassenheit, Takt, Anlehnung, Schwung, Geraderichtung, Versammlung). Every ride should start at the bottom of the scale, and master each step consecutively. For instance, never try for Impulsion when you do not have Contact. This Training Scale is the foundation of the Classical German System and of Dr. Parra’s training philosophy. Dr. Parra’s philosophies by which he conducts his life are courtesy, integrity, perseverance, self-control, sharing, and strength of character. These are the same qualities he tries to pass on to the students and staff who make up his team.

The patented, adaptive, and self-learning algorithms of Giant Gray technology “see” anomalies often hidden in oceans of data, bringing to light actionable insights with an intelligence that is anything but artificial. In short, Giant Gray helps dramatically improve business operational awareness and incident response for its customers – as well as prevent costly interruptions and breakdowns – through its Graydient technology platform with applications in industrial (SCADA/ICS), physical security and surveillance, and cybersecurity environments. Most data analytics technology is challenging to deploy, expensive to use and maintain, confusing to understand, and limited to identifying known problems in a particular domain. Giant Gray’s patented technology reduces costs and simplifies usage and maintenance by teaching itself from observing data – and it excels at detecting the unexpected and providing improved context by correlating various, disconnected data sources. These real-time insights allow customers to make operational adjustments before early-warning signals grow into true incidents that impact safety, security, and business operations.  Graydient stands apart from traditional analytics with its artificial cognitive neurolinguistics approach to machine learning, meaning it creates a custom language to describe the data from scratch and is not limited to primitive, baseline behavior models from the start.

There were three founders: Paul Hyman, Jim Phelps, and Bob Dormer. They left a New York-based firm to create their own practice. The goal of the new firm was to provide service to clients regulated primarily by the Food and Drug Administration, the agency with which the three founders had extensive experience. When Steve McNamara joined the practice in 1984, the firm became known as Hyman, Phelps & McNamara. Later that year, the firm incorporated, and has since been known as Hyman, Phelps & McNamara, P.C. The founders intended to maintain the firm at a size to meet the needs of food and drug clients. Over the years, the size of the firm has grown considerably due to the ever-increasing needs of those clients. As government regulation of the food, dietary supplement, drug, biologic, medical device and cosmetic industries has escalated, our food and drug practice has expanded into many related subspecialties, including controlled substances, fraud and abuse, reimbursement and payor issues, and advertising and claims substantiation, to name a few. (To view a list of our specialty practice areas, see Practice Areas.) The backgrounds and experiences of our attorneys support the breadth of the firm's practice. Our attorneys have had experience in many branches of the federal government, including the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Justice (Office of Consumer Litigation), U.S. Attorneys Offices, and the Drug Enforcement Administration. Three of our attorneys have been general counsels in major pharmaceutical houses, and others have served in industry trade associations. Still others have scientific backgrounds in areas that complement our practice, such as clinical research and the practice of pharmacy. One member is a former judge, and several were law clerks. (To view the individual biographies, see Professionals ). Together the firm's attorneys bring a seasoned focus to the issues that confront food, dietary supplement, drug, biologic, medical device, and cosmetic companies. Further, in addressing clients' issues, we have a vast network of resources at our disposal to supplement our combined expertise. Because aspects of our regulatory practice often involve complex or novel scientific issues, we work collaboratively with physicians and consultants, as needed, who are able to provide targeted medical or scientific expertise to help accomplish the regulatory goals of our clients. In addition, we have longstanding relationships with regulatory counsel in foreign jurisdictions - including the European Union, Asia, Canada, Mexico, South America, and Australia - in which clients may seek to market their products, source ingredients or materials, hold clinical trials, or may otherwise require assistance. Our goal is to provide prompt and economical professional services suited to each client's specific needs. The firm's clients are as diverse as the regulatory issues they face. They range from individuals and start-up companies with no in-house legal staff to large multinational corporations. In addition, other law firms retain HPM to provide targeted expertise in food and drug law to assist their clients. HPM works to avoid legal problems when possible, and to help solve them when necessary. The firm helps companies conduct business as efficiently and profitably as possible by providing advice and counsel on meeting current and future regulatory requirements.","Food and Beverage, Health Care, Professional Services",3,"Jim Phelps, Paul Hyman, Robert Dormer",51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
