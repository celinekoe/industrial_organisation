Our eco-system enables this at the bare minimum costs so the founders can fully focus on delivering the product vision.  Challenges faced by Tech Founders Working in isolation can be a big issue when you’re shaping considerable start-up thoughts into fully developed ideas. Tech founders need people to brainstorm, support and build a roadmap. They require a team consisting of a Product Manager, UI/UX Designers, Architects and Engineers to fully develop an idea. While the technology team behind the bootstrapping of the product is important for MVP success, attracting top talent seems impossible due to money and identity constraints. As a part-time tech co-founder, you can’t take a huge risk by building an in-house team at an early stage. Early-stage startups are mostly self-funded with small capital for MVP development which often compromises the product scope or the quality and stability of the product. The result is a product-fit failure. How do we support Tech-startup founders? We share the founders' vision and start-up risk to successfully bootstrap or launch the MVP and get them investment-ready. We engage through milestone-based equity in the start-up to mitigate both financial and product risks, unlike traditional agencies that are only concerned about billing hours. We engage with start-up founders in three phases. The first stage focuses on prototype development, while the objective of the second stage is to build the product, and the third stage is geared towards self-sustainability. Our goal is to take founders through the first stage to launch your MVP and establish a product-market fit. That means you have a stable and scalable minimum viable product to test with your prospective users and prove the traction to raise the next round of funding. After the MVP launch, we will support you to establish your in-house tech function.",,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Harry's is a family owned and operated business. Harry S. and Wife Magoline H. Tosh began the operation in 1955. After World War II Harry was an FHA & VA Real Estate Appraiser. He also was a builder at the time. He was having difficulty in getting his building supplies from the local dealers. This is where he got the idea to start Harry's building materials. In 1960 their son Harry R. Tosh (Bobby) began work full time and became manager in 1964. In 1974, Bobby and his Wife Hazel purchased his fathers interest in the business and began a partnership with his mother, Magoline H.Tosh. In 1974 the business was incorporated with Bobby Tosh President, Johnny R. Sanders who joined the company in 1964, became Vice President, and Magoline H. Tosh Secretary-Treasurer until her retirement in 2003. After her retirement Teresa Tosh-Langley filled Magoline Tosh's roll as Secretary- Treasurer. In 2014, Robby Tosh was promoted to President. The Rusk location started in 1955. The success lead to the opening of our Jacksonville (1983), Troup (1990) and Nacogdoches (1992) locations. Since then Harry's has opened a Door and Cabinet shop that specializes in custom interior and exterior doors and cabinets. In 2015, Your Home by Harry's was opened to show customers products in a home setting.","Hardware, Manufacturing, Real Estate",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Up until the eighties, no adequate method had been found to measure performance on a bike in training or racing, you still had to rely on lab testing instead. This meant that athletes were forced to go back and forth between their real performance - cycling on the road or cross country - and the ergometer in the lab. With lab testing, they still couldn't tell how their performance had changed over a period of a few hours, either in a race or in training. Lab testing was an intermittent check-up, at best, but couldn't tell athletes anything about how they were performing day-to-day.
