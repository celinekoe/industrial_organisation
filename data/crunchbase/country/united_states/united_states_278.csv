The real problem lies in delivering their","3,196,025",Southern US,$1M to $10M,Active,2014-04-04,day,,,,,For Profit,http://speakerstack.com,"For professional speakers, standing up in front of thousands of people is the easy part. The real problem lies in delivering their carefully prepared presentations to show organizers and the audience. Presentations tend to include an abundance of multimedia content, such as videos and images, making email delivery impossible due to the large file size. Resorting to FTP or Dropbox can be inconsistent and inefficient. This real world task can become quite complicated at a time when speakers need to concentrate on preparing for their upcoming performance. The process is just as problematic for meeting and conference organizers who are responsible for planning every aspect of their events and whose jobs depend on coordinating all of the necessary requirements of their speakers. Meanwhile, they usually like to review presentations to check them for consistency and to make sure they will function properly on the equipment for the session. If materials aren't received until the last minute, the speaker often has to go live without the benefit of review. Organizers also have a substantial need for content not limited to presentations, including things like bios, profile pictures and handouts. Unfortunately, there is no system designated to housing and organizing this information. Fortunately, SpeakerStack is a new platform built specifically for speakers and organizers to help alleviate the time and headaches that go along with being both a speaker and conference organizer. SpeakerStack was developed by a team that has been working in the industry for years and made it their focus to solve some of the inconsistencies that have become so prevalent. SpeakerStack represents a new kind of virtual space where speakers can upload collateral or connect to repositories like Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, Skydrive, and other common locations for content. All of their materials for audience engagement are online and ready to go. Speakers can easily create profiles by pulling their information from their social networks so that they don't need to recreate it for each show or engagement. Organizers using a portal, mobile app, or website can also connect to an API to get their information in a more dynamic way, previously not possible. Show organizers can upload a spreadsheet of speakers with all of their session information, which then maps to the profiles of specific speakers in the system. They will also be able to monitor progress, view documents, approve presentations, and export it all from SpeakerStack. SpeakerStack can be integrated with existing show management software and technologies via APIs, bringing real-time data access to show organizers. SpeakerStack is available now to start helping speakers and conference organizers today! For more information, visit www.SpeakerStack.com.",Software,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Ok this site was built by a fellow job seeker after he spent months looking for a new job. He realized after applying to almost 100 jobs he started getting disorganized quick. Which resume did he send to that job? Did he follow up after applying to this job. What was the contact's name at that other job? Notes would be kept on scraps of paper. Resumes would be kept in a file folder. But when it came time for an interview, he could not remember which resume I had sent... What to do? In his years in IT, he had implemented Customer Relationship Management software many times. After getting frustrated at my unorganized state, he realized that something like a Customer Relationship Management system would manage all of this information around me. So he built Jobsarium.

It cost you some money, but that's okay, because you're confident that your skill and proposal will get you the bid.  A couple days later, your bid isn't chosen, because someone else who is far less qualified got the job just because they can undercut your price. Thought:  What if you had to pay for every bid you placed?  That would reduce the amount of SPAM bidders who bid on every project.  But what about the cost to you?  You've ALSO seen websites where you do have to bid on projects.  Sure it makes for a quality control, but 10 bids later at a crazy amount of money per bid, you're broke and didn't get a single job.  Solution:  You have to pay for a bid, but if you don't win the job, you get your money back.  Doesn't that seem simple?  IT IS! What we do:  You get charged a small monthly membership, at which point you are entitled to make a certain amount of bids as part of your membership.  If you don't win a project, you get refunded the bid cost.  If you win the project, you don't get your bid money back.  Do you have a job you want to post?  For the same monthly membership, you can post a certain amount of projects every month.   How do we make money on this:  Once the project poster selects a winning bidder (not always the highest or lowest, but the best proposal), we take a small percentage of the final agreed upon price. Why does this work:  Your project is posted with the rest after being carefully looked over to make sure it meets standards and quality control.  Then our group of prospective freelancers, whom we have already qualified and verified as authentic job seekers, bid on your project.  Detailed proposals are given, and a price is set which they believe they can fulfill your project needs.  Everyone is qualified and verified before they are even added to the system, project posters and freelancers alike.",Internet Services,,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Really! We're here to address the changes in your life when it comes to meeting new people. Moving. Your friend's getting married. You getting into a relationship. Kids moving away. Transitional life events where things aren't really the same as they once were.  It's not easy to make real friends. There's a lot that goes into it. Interests. Opinions. Personalities. Timing... and maybe the biggest thing - is that other person even looking for a friend! We've got you covered in a few ways that no one else does... first, we have a simple profile that asks questions that you'd want to know of a friend. Sam has top tens to share your interests and soapboxes to share your opinions which the rest don't that are very cool & helpful. We also specifically every user – do you actually want to meet new people… so you can see their reply and how enthusiastic they are! This is all great… but here’s where we start to get into a few concepts that change the game. The first is profiles based on what what you want to do.  In a relationship? Looking to meet other couples as a couple? Form a couples profile with your partner and meet other couples together! Guys… have a few buddies that you like go out with and meet girls? Form a crew profile and meet other crews! Grow your crew and show your friendships! Having online friends on Sam isn’t a quantity thing – it’s a quality one! Do you have kids? Do they need to meet other kids? Do you want to have a place where your family can go to share news? Form a Fam profile! Meet other families or just connect with your family! Your social profile covers the basics of meeting new people, but targeting specific relationship types is special. Sam has a dating profile as well – for those looking to date – but it separates the social relationships from those looking for romantic ones… and that too… is special. The second HUGE way (there’s more) is by providing awesome tools to eliminate the deadly obstacle: availability ;) For most – you’re week is pretty much the same – week in, week out. Let’s say I’d like to go to the gym with someone and workout on Wednesday night. Sam has a standing weekly calendar that says – I’m looking to do something x night, want to join me? You can search by it. They may not be available as everyone’s schedules vary, but it’s the first step in coordinating schedules of similar interests. The other way Sam rocks is by taking the concept of personals to each of these profile types and targeting dates and places! Link your profile and gallery pictures!  We’re making this easy! Sam is not here to keep you online! Sam wants to make your social life better by giving you the tools you need!
