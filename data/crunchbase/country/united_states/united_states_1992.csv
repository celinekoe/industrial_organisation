Our mission is to bring new technology to the market through inventions and products that people actually need and want to use. The Revocharge team is comprised of thinkers and doers who work together cohesively to turn our bright ideas into your bright future. About Us Cemal Samsilova is the Founder and CEO of the Revocharge patent-pending smartphone case that allows users to sync and charge their phones whenever and wherever they want. Revocharge is designed to fit iPhone’s and Androids, and has received full Made for iPhone (MFI) certification. The Revocharge case is ultra-thin, yet remarkably durable, and connects to the Revocharge charge and sync universal mount, allowing users to sync and charge their phones at their desk, in their cars, or in the middle of nowhere. Built with Autosense technology, Revocharge adjusts to a device’s needs, meaning it can provide optimum charging, no matter what the device. Born from innovation Revocharge was born from the imagination and ingenuity of Samsilova. With experience working for Lockheed Martin and IBM, Samsilova has long been exposed to environments that fostered creativity, technology and innovation. Samsilova decided it was time to use his valuable experience to work, and began creating the foundations for Revocharge. The creation of Revocharge While Samsilova has brainstormed and created other innovative and useful products and tools, Revocharge is particularly near and dear to his heart. “Samsilova was tired of having to stay connected to cables and cords in order to avoid being disconnected from friends, family, and colleagues.” Like most 21st century people, Samsilova finds himself on the road often. And like most people, he gets frustrated at how often his phone is low on battery .. or even dead. Outlets aren’t always nearby. Cords and cables break, or lost or even stolen. In an ever-growing mobile world, it dawned on Samsilova that his smartphone wasn’t really all that mobile. Missed calls. Lost photo ops at family gatherings. Missing out on what mattered most in his life. Finally, Samsilova had enough. But what could he do? There had to be a way for him to remain connected to the important people and moments in his life, without having to remain connected to cables or cords. After thorough research, Samsilova realized the tool he needed wasn’t on the market. So he did what any innovator does – he got to work inventing it. Samsilova’s goal was to create a power source that lasted long enough – no matter the smartphone – and could be reused over, and over again. Enter Revocharge Revocharge is a patent-pending smartphone case that allows users to sync and charge their phones whenever and wherever they want. Connecting to a universal mount through the power of magnets, Revocharge is easy to attach, and detach, to your desk mount, car mount, arm band or belt clip. It’s designed to make it easy for users to take their iPhone’s or Androids with them, anywhere in the world, without ever having to worry about losing battery power or data. Simply attach the Revocharge battery to the back of your case, and your phone will receive a full charge – at optimum speed, without your ever having to touch a cable. And thanks to a micro USB input built into the Revocharge case, you can easily sync data (like music and apps) while charging your battery and phone). Stay connected while your phone’s disconnected When you think about it, mobile phones aren’t so mobile. These days, smartphones eat up battery power faster than their archaic predecessors, meaning unless you’re near a power source, you could likely go the bulk of the day without “plugging in.” With Revocharge, you never have to worry about plugging in again. Connect your smartphone to your Revocharge battery pack, and give your smartphone its second wind, and a new lease on life.","Information Technology, Mobile, Platforms, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Our original idea was to create a data platform backed by crawlers and AI (machine learning) to identify trends in the startup ecosystem that would create valuable intelligence for venture capitalists. We later realized, that while this idea was good in concept, the technology was not mature enough to deliver the results we initially aimed for. After much deliberation with our VC mentors, we realized we could create a significant level of value for our clients by building relationships with founders and reaching out to them directly to gather exclusive intelligence and insights on their funding initiatives while tracking and delivering this intel via a SaaS portal. Ultimately, our mentors (who are VC's themselves) recognized how valuable this information would be, since most funding rounds are unknown until they are closed and it is difficult for their research teams to understand what startups to prioritize. Disclaimer: We are NOT a broker and do not generate any income from startups. Our income is supplied exclusively by venture firms, investment banks, and private equity firms who purchase licenses to our intelligence platform. StartupHawk is a research service that operates a SaaS portal forthe types of B2B firms above. Many venture firms use us as an outsourced option instead of hiring internal research analysts to drive deal-flow or will use us to help augment the capabilities of their internal research team. Our analysts reach out to startup founders daily to gather information on their initiatives, progress, timing, and what they are looking for in a venture partner. The benefit to these startups is we provide free exposure to investors by creating a profile for them in our portal. The value to our customers is that we're getting information directly from the source since there is no data publicly available on future funding rounds or the vast majority of funding rounds until that round is complete and therefore, until it's too late. We cannot guarantee startups we interview that our customers will end up reaching out to them. It is completely up to our customers to initiate a conversation based on whether the startup meets their focus criteria. We are not involved in any discussions between the startup and the venture firm.","Financial Services, Information Technology, Lending and Investments, Other, Professional Services, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

As we searched for ways to help her find relief naturally, we discovered the incredible potential of hemp-derived CBD. This led us to delve deep into research and development to create a pure and potent CBD product that delivered real results. This formula, and the relief it provided, was so effective that it quickly gained demand among friends and family. This marked a turning point in our lives. So in 2017 we created Farmacy Bliss to pursue a burning desire to make our pure, full spectrum, solvent-free, medical grade CBD formulation available to anyone seeking relief or who simply wants to de-stress and experience an enhanced sense of wellbeing. We are humbled and grateful to work side-by-side with a dedicated family team and to bring our different backgrounds and skills to something we are very passionate about – contributing to the health and wellness of thousands of people by providing CBD products formulated to deliver the purest and most effective results possible. This is an exciting time for all of us as we continue to learn from the ever-growing body of evidence that hemp-derived, full spectrum CBD has an extraordinary ability to engage our body’s own endocannabinoid system to reduce pain, inflammation, anxiety, and promote a state of greater wellness. If you have any questions about our products and how they can help you, please reach out to us and we’ll be happy to help.
