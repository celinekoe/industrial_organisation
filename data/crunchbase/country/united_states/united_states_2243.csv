The printing and fulfillment process is designed to make very small orders, even down to one bottle cap, economical. BottleMark has no minimum order, and no tiered pricing; shipping is the only factor encouraging larger orders, and even that is carefully minimized. This is in amazing contrast to the traditional bottle cap manufacturing process, which has a typical minimum order of a half-million caps, and also requires lithographic plate creation. The BottleMark website features a hand-coded ""design tool"" to upload, place, size, and order bottle caps. It works on all major browsers. A future version will be based on SVG and allow greater capabilities. Bottle caps are used by home brewers and breweries in bulk, but are also popular in crafts and scrapbooking, as well as jewelry and other decorations.

In some ways, it models the way humans learn language, facts, context, and rules. The whole thing started way back in 1988 and went on the web in 1997. It is unique - not related to any other known AI technologies! The 'general AI' of Jabberwacky stores everything everyone has ever said and finds the most appropriate thing to say using contextual pattern matching techniques. In speaking to you it uses just that learned material and borrows a little bit of your intelligence as it learns more. With no hard-coded rules, it relies entirely on the principles of feedback. This is very different from the majority of Chabot's, which are rule-bound and finite. If you speak in a foreign language it will learn it, and respond appropriately if it has enough to go on. It can be taught slang English, word games, jokes, and any other form of identifiable language trait.
