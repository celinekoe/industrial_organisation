The iHEARtest is available online from iHEAR or at select retail pharmacies across the U.S. The iHEARtest results in a Hearing Number(TM) for each ear that indicates degree of hearing loss. The Hearing Number is then used to determine which iHEAR hearing aid solution will be most appropriate for the consumer's degree of hearing loss using proprietary software applications from iHEAR. iHEAR has over 50 patents submitted with 27 patents issued on the technology, applications and services it provides in its end-to-end closed business model.  iHEAR Medical is founded by Adnan Shennib, who previously founded and led the development of major Silicon Valley medical device firms including InSound Medical which was acquired in 2010 by Sonova-Phonak.  iHEAR Medical is Shennib’s latest venture dedicated to creating affordable and accessible hearing aid solutions for consumers. iHEAR Medical's Board of Directors is comprised of seasoned venture capitalists and advisors who have presided over numerous successful healthcare companies.",Health Care,1,Adnan Shennib,11-50,6,M&A,14494999,USD,14494999,16794999,USD,16794999,"Highlight Capital, Ameritas Life Insurance, Lighthouse Capital Partners, Aphelion Capital, Brother",4,6,,Private,,,,,,

In 2017, the Simetric team recognized an underlying need in the IoT industry- the lack of fundamental support and expertise in IoT cellular connectivity management. The existing connectivity platforms deployed by operators were built with a proprietary focus, impeding any company’s ability to manage their IoT instances across operators effectively. With the initial focus of many IoT efforts being largely automation, the limitations of competing IoT platforms were not fully recognized.  At the forefront of Simetric’s original vision was the customer.  We created a new platform that encompassed a unified management pane that established for a company - of any size and any type - the tools to centrally manage all connectivity needs in a Single Pane of Glass.  In 2019, the company looked at what the next phase of IoT could become to unify connectivity and device performance to enable companies to not only unify non-conforming IoT platforms but also to move IoT business process execution to the device effortlessly across all the operators’ IoT platforms.  We then enlisted proven executives from Microsoft, Cisco, and Verizon to further accelerate our thought leadership that unified the strengths of the cloud with the network and efforts of operators.    With the global IoT market scaling into billions of cellular connections and the next horizon of needs driven heavily by 5G and autonomous driving, companies will need an IoT platform that is highly extensible and analytical for them to evolve their businesses with these technology advancements.

For over two decades, scientists at Hadassah Hospital's Diabetes Unit, led by Professor Hanoch Bar-On, worked to develop a technology designed to enable the oral administration of insulin to diabetics.  A medical breakthrough in 2005 laid the foundation for the founding of Oramed Pharmaceuticals, of which Hadassah remains a part owner. Professor Bar-On helped found Oramed, together with Dr. Miriam Kidron, and served as a director until his untimely death in 2006. From the time of the company’s inception, Oramed has successfully tested its technology via various animal and human studies on its two flagship products, an oral insulin capsule, ORMD-0801, and an oral exenatide (a GLP-1 Analog) capsule, ORMD-0901. Combination therapy (ORMD 0801+0901) showed promising results in pre-clinical trials, and clinical trials are expected to follow.  Oramed's unique oral delivery technology serves as a platform for other vaccines and medications currently available in injection form. The company is approached by pharmaceutical companies large and small looking to test compliance with Oramed’s technology on their product pipeline. Oramed has garnered worldwide support of prominent scientists to its scientific advisory board, a testament to its sound technology:  the former Senior VP of Pfizer, Dr. Michael Berelowitz; Prof. John Amatruda, former Senior VP of Merck and Co.; Prof. Ele Ferrannini, Past President of the EASD*; and Prof. Avram Hershko, 2004 Nobel Prize Laureate in Chemistry, and a leader in the field of drug delivery methods, among others. The office of the Chief Scientist of Israel has also shown its confidence in Oramed’s technology, having awarded Oramed its third consecutive grant to continue its research. Recent and promising developments at Oramed also include 5 patent approvals for its technologies in the Israeli, Japanese, Australian, and New Zealand Patent Offices. Patent approval is particularly important as it validates Oramed’s technology, establishing an international stronghold for its oral protein delivery methods. Oramed has an additional 34 pending patents and expects to see more of them approved in the future.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",2,"Miriam Kidron, Nadav Kidron",11-50,8,IPO,126016643,USD,126016643,227891643,USD,227891643,"Scilex Holding Company, HTBT, Cybele Holdings",2,3,,Public,2006-04-10,,,ORMP,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/oramed-pharmaceuticals-ipo--772c46c7,TLV - Tel Aviv Stock Exchange

It’s as essential as food and water. So much so that human connection is elemental to positive health outcomes. Perhaps this is why, when asked what patients want most from their healthcare experience, 85 percent of the surveyed said: “a doctor who listens.” That’s the essence of delivering patient-centered care—being responsive, respectful, and focused on our unique needs and values. Yet, even with the great strides and investments that we’ve made toward that end, delivering truly responsive, patient-centered care has proven elusive because of varied components, such as efficiency, effectiveness, care coordination, timing, and employee engagement, factor into the equation.  The truth is, patient experience is not limited to a single face-to-face interaction with a provider or care team. Instead, one’s healthcare journey is complex and touches upon a myriad opportunities to connect patients with providers, employees, and members across the continuum of care. Each interaction—good, bad, or somewhere in-between—intertwines with the overall human experience, patient outcomes, and, ultimately, the long-term success of healthcare providers. At Feedtrail, we believe delivering healthcare experiences that are exceptional, patient-centered, and profitable requires a new approach—one shaped by a comprehensive understanding of each person’s unique healthcare journey as it unfolds. It’s by capturing human interactions—as they occur in “real-time”—that we can strengthen human connections and advance better outcomes for patients, providers, employees, members, and the entire health economy. The Feedtrail Experience Management platform empowers healthcare organizations and their  teams of any size to engage with and learn from patients, clinical care providers, employees, and members instantly, at any point during the lifecycle of care. With advanced analytics and seamless EHR automations, Feedtrail facilitates multichannel interactions that are personalized to users and their care journey tied to specific business objectives. The platform makes it easy to capture healthcare encounters at the moment they occur so organizations can respond when it matters most. Our secure platform is easy to implement, requires no additional hardware or devices, and offers a user-friendly interface that fits seamlessly within any healthcare scenario. We reinforce this technology with deep domain expertise and unparalleled, end-to-end customer support that allows healthcare organizations to identify explicit opportunities for improvement across any number of service lines and act immediately to deliver higher-value experiences.","Health Care, Software",4,"Jesse Haka, Matti Lehmus, Mikko Lehmus, Paul Jaglowski",11-50,6,,2570000,USD,2570000,2670000,USD,2670000,"SaaS Ventures, FCA Venture Partners, Cofounders Capital, Cedars-Sinai Accelerator, Scott Garber",3,8,,Private,,,,,,
