Key use cases: -Investment manager due diligence and ongoing monitoring for investors -Asset management research for consulting firms and financial institutions -Sales prospecting e.g. which financial advisers should a fund complex targeting investment advisers, or a brokerage firm targeting hedge funds -Generating investment ideas e.g. using portfolio disclosures and indications of large holders or insider sales We automatically source, extract, and structure information from government regulatory filings websites run by agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Federal Reserve, and Department of Labor (DOL). In addition, we enrich this data from public sources including FINRA's Broker Check website, other public industry websites, news, and social media. Lastly, we acquire and structure market prices and other data on market indices, investment funds and securities from a diverse set of financial data sources such as financial websites, fund complex websites, fund factsheet documents and investor presentations.
