He is now the owner of more than 70 patents in the field of regenerative science and technology, many of which are used directly in his company’s work. One of the primary technologies developed and used by the company is its phototherapy patches. Phototherapy, the term for using light as a therapy tool, is used in many forms across a wide range of disciplines, such as laser light therapy. The company’s phototherapy patches reflect particular wavelengths of light back onto the wearer’s skin in order to elicit certain health and wellness effects. Areas of focus for the company’s patches include pain management, sleep improvement, and the proliferation of antioxidants. One example of this is the first product developed by the company — the Energy Enhancer Patch. This patch works without stimulants or drugs of any kind to increase energy and endurance. This is accomplished through the stimulation of beta-oxidation which allows the body to produce more energy than carbohydrate burning.

BitPlus Hosting (BPH) BPH will offer the only known Single-Phase Liquid Immersion Cooling (SLIC) hosting solution available in North America providing its Cryptomining and Data Center customers a competitive advantage through increased equipment efficiencies. The use of immersion cooling, over time we believe it will render current air-cooled technology obsolete.  In providing greater efficiency to our hosted clients BPH experiences superior client retention and will establish itself as an industry leader in both quality and quantity of clients served, both in Cryptomining and Data. In preparation to capitalize on our power build out, BitPlus Hosting intends to acquire current cryptomining hosting and mining companies and convert them to immersion at their facilities or consolidate their operations to our facilities with extremely low electricity costs.  An added benefit to BPH is that profitability in our own mining operations will be superior to traditional mining and hosting companies, see “BitPlus Capital” below.  Our internal mining expertise is magnified with superior low-cost electricity rates. We produce our own electricity, with our own equipment, from surplus natural gas at rates under $0.03/kWh by way of our owned company, Global Northern Resources, LLC. Global Northern Resources, LLC (GNR)  GNR produces large volume, low cost electricity on owned real estate. We then lease space and land, in conjunction with long-term high margin electricity contracts to clients with large megawatt power needs including; Data processing, Data storage, High-tech manufacturing (I.e. plastics & electronics), Gaming, Cryptomining, Vertical Farming, Logistics & Distribution, Warehousing and Multi-use Land Development projects. Low cost power acquisition is a cornerstone for GNR’s immediate and long-term growth.  Our short-term objective will be to produce 250 MW of electricity by year-end 2021, 500 MW of electricity by year-end 2022 and 1,000MW of electricity by year-end 2024.  We currently have 40MW completed in Colorado Springs, CO with an additional 50MW ready for build out.  In Grand Forks, ND we have 30MW completed with an additional 100MW site identified and in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada we have 58MW available for acquisition.  Our 250MW objective in 2021 will be realized upon meeting our funding objectives.   BitPlus Technologies (BPT) BPT is developing a new, disruptive technology for cryptomining.  Our team of computer scientists have vast experience developing the microchips currently used in the most efficient miners available today.  Our goal is to manufacture a miner specifically designed for immersion cooling.  Once completed and in production our miners will use less electricity and produce the highest possible hashrate currently available in cryptomining.   BitPlus Capital (BPC)   BitPlus Holdings, Ltd (BPHL) also mines cryptocurrency for its own portfolio through our investment firm BitPlus Capital (BPC).  The goal of BitPlus Capital is to generate coins, at institutional volume, below market prices greatly enhancing profitability prior to the management of mined coins. BPC has consistently demonstrated an expertise to generate digital currency far below retail market cost.  Collectively, BPHL encompasses electric power supply and real estate through Global Northern Resources, mining and data hosting through BitPlus Hosting, equipment manufacturing through BitPlus Technologies, and portfolio management through BitPlus Capital.  BPHL in conjunction with BPC, BPH and BPT has as its objective to launch a successful public company while controlling in excess of 10% of Bitcoin hashrate.","Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Payments, Software",4,"Kenneth Abrams, Steven Harris, Timothy Brogan, Tom Blasen",1-10,1,Seed,406957,USD,406957,406957,USD,406957,,,,,Private,,,,,,

In turn, these users tap into a vast wealth of local, regional and national knowledge to increase productivity, yield, and revenue. Our inspiration is the ahupua‘a, a traditional land division in Hawaii that stretches from the mountains to the ocean, containing the many important resources needed for the communities within. Hawaii, home to our global headquarters, is committed to doubling its food production by 2030. We see significant unmet needs here and around the world, as well as great potential in empowering ‘agripreneurs’ – the aspiring, growing farmer.  Today, thanks to visionaries in the field, we are seeing more interest than ever before. Investment in U.S. agriculture technology reached over $700 million in 2017, more than the previous two years combined.  At Smart Yields, we’re using this momentum to think big by thinking small (to medium), using farm-to-screen technologies to enhance your farm-to-table experience.

When renowned psychologist Abraham Maslow created Maslow's hierarchy of needs, he identified characteristics of the fortunate few who—through hard work, a commitment to learning, and humility—can transcend life's difficulties to reach a point of self-actualization. Only those at this level can be fully present in a world where truth, beauty, justice, uniqueness, and other qualities guide life's journey on a day-to-day basis, rather than the attempt to obtain material possessions or other forms of real or perceived security. Importantly, Maslow noted that individuals who become increasingly less focused on material needs tend to acquire more wealth over time. With the right help, we believe the same concept can apply to organizations such as yours. Imagine a world in which more and more corporations and other organizations are committed to a never-ending journey towards ethical, sustainable, and profitable decision-making. Your personal quality of life—and that of your fellow global citizens—would improve, without having to sacrifice any of your or your organization’s drive to succeed personally and professionally. What can you expect from us? Well, we aren't going to bring you the all-too-common marketing company experience consisting of a few fancy buzzwords, recommending a charitable giving program to score social media points, or using some type of new-age unintelligible marketing speak.
