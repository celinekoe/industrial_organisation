We put a $ & ¢ value on each outcome, generating actionable analytics that drive down healthcare costs while improving the quality of care for health plans and workers’ compensation programs. We have two ways of quantifying outcomes depending on the data available to us: Claims + Absence Costs: When we have the medical and pharmacy claims and an employer’s HR absence records we calculate the risk-adjusted total costs (claims + absence) to get an employee back to work and/or keep them there. We use this solution to quantify the employee outcomes for employers that self-insure their health plans and workers’ compensation programs; and we also use it with workers’ compensation insurers and TPAs, who can substitute the indemnity payments to the injured employees for the absence costs. Claims per Heathy Day: When we have just the claims, we calculate the risk-adjusted claims per healthy day. Instead of asking how much it costs, and how long it takes, to get an employee better and back to work, we ask how much it costs in claims per day to keep someone healthy. We use this solution for health insurance companies and TPAs, Medicare Advantage plans, state and other multi-employer health plans, ACOs and provider groups taking on risk, and when measuring the outcomes of the dependents under an employer health plan. The power of our cutting-edge analytics was documented in the case study “How Fort Worth Drove Down Workers’ Compensation Costs While Getting Injured Employees Better Care” that appeared in Public Risk, the magazine of the national Public Risk Management Association (PRIMA). We drove down the City of Fort Worth’s costs by 23%. There was a similar article by D Magazine about our work with Fort Worth entitled “Doing the Impossible: Better Care at Lower Costs.” In addition, our analytics were the subject of “How to Decrease Your Health Plan Costs” that appeared in The Self-Insurer, the magazine of the Self-Insurance Institute of America (SIIA). Our unique approach originates with our founder, Dr. Jack McCallum, who was a neurosurgeon for 30 years. After Jack retired as a surgeon, he began founding and building healthcare technology companies. IntegerHealth is his fifth. The one before us was CenseoHealth, which is now called Signify Health and did an IPO recently at a $5 billion valuation.","Health Care, Information Technology",3,"Bill McCallum, Jack McCallum, Scott Roloff",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
