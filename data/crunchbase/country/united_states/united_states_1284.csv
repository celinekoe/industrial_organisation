At the time, I was a barista at Peet’s Coffee and Tea in Evanston, Illinois—a suburb just north of the great city of Chicago. I left the coffee industry after being in the business for almost ten years to pursue other career interests, but my heart was still with my favorite beverage—coffee. My interests were split in two directions—professional editorial work and specialty coffee. The Table was the great compromise. By starting this blog, I was able to keep one foot in the coffee industry and the other in the corporate world. A Table in the Corner of the Cafe is a blog dedicated to specialty coffee and cafe reviews, primarily, but it also features a wealth of information about coffee, my opinions of the goings on in and of the coffee industry, coffee news, and some fun and games along the way.
