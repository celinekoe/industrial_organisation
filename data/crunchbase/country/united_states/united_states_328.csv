In most industries, as much as 70% or more of the purchase decision is already made up before you’re even looped into the conversation with potential buyers.  This presents an enormous challenge for many legacy sales teams and businesses that are living in the past. But it’s also a great opportunity for those companies that are able to get found by the right people, in the right places, at the right time, and most of all in the right context.  Approached correctly, with the right mindset, your company becomes seen as true industry experts and trusted advisors. You attract smarter clients. You gain much more leverage during the sales cycle.
