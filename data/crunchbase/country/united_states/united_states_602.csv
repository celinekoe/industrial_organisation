ColeTech Group,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coletech-group,"CleanTech, Mechanical Engineering, Public Transportation, Renewable Energy","West Lafayette, Indiana, United States",A novel technology that uses car traffic to create renewable energy,"282,702","Great Lakes, Midwestern US",,Active,2022-05-01,day,,,,,For Profit,http://sites.google.com/view/coletechgroup/home ,"Our start-up based in West Lafayette IN uses car traffic to create renewable energy. The technology is called Electric Humps (e-humps) that resemble speed humps, but rather compress under force when driven over to power a turbine generating clean electricity. This allows individuals to knowingly make a positive impact on the environment by simply going about their daily tasks. The key differentiators of e-hump technology are its efficiency, scalability, and low capital cost. Existing renewable energy technologies in the market cannot provide immediate financial relief from high electricity bills because of high capital costs. E-humps fill this gap. For example, e-humps have a much lower capital expense than solar (e.g., 3x lower) and wind technologies, and much lower land requirement (e.g., - 6 to 8 acers for 150,000 solar panels) while maintaining efficiency on a per kWh basis which cannot be beat by the current competition. According to our business analysis and prototype design, an integrated hump system on a utility scale is expected to produce an estimated 2,023 kWh (or 2 MW per day) or 738,395 kWh per year with daily variations depending upon the traffic rate and represents an annual reduction of 523 metric tons of CO2 emissions annually (EPA, 2022). This is equivalent to the CO2 emissions from 66 homes' electricity use for one year (EPA, 2022). When applying the net-meter price per kWh at a conservative of $0.16 kWh (i.e., the national rate) a utility e-hump system placed on the highway or busy inner city road can generate revenue of $323 per day, which provides a net revenue of $109,794 per year. The projected return-on-investment (ROI) for a $150,000 e-hump system equates to a 73% payback period of 1.4 years.  When scaled down for residential/business, the roadway location (right-of-way) allows homes to share the system as a more affordable option to immediately reduce electric bills- through our E-humps Go App. This system is manufactured for $12,500; that can produce 267 kWh per day (97455 kWh per year) while the average home uses 28.9 kWh per day. When applying the net metering price per kWh at the conservative rate of $0.16 kWh, the residential e-hump system can generate revenue of $42 per day (b) minus 69.1 metric tons of carbon dioxide, which is the equivalent to 13 homes’ electricity use for a year (EPA, 2023). The ROI for a $18,500 system is 62% with a payback period of 1.6 years.  Lastly, the City of West Lafayette, near Purdue Campus has agreed to host and demo an e-hump pilot once it's built. Because we already have in-kind factory space, extremely high expertise on the team to include Dr. Clark Dale owner of BPI in West Lafayette, IN and Mr. Stephen Cole, retired owner and bridge engineer of ED Swett Co., to name a few, and of course Purdue's nearby resources, we believe we can build this technology in 1 year.   We are currently seeking private investment funding of $1,200,000 for 35% of the company.  Our best estimate is that it will require $1.8 million to start up our business- with $1.2 million investment being offered for 35% ownership in the company (valuation of $3,428,571).  This would return $1.3M in the first 2 years of net profit. An itemized capital cost estimate for the 8-piston e-hump is available upon request. The Exit strategy for investors is buyback or sale.","Energy, Science and Engineering, Sustainability, Transportation",,,1-10,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
