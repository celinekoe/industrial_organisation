Finding a decent - let alone great - app amongst the 800,000 other apps in the App Store is a daunting task. AppCurious has built a social network based on trust to make finding the right app for you a little bit easier. When we see peoples phones, we are curious to see what apps they have. AppCurious allows you to do just that and find new apps. AppCurious is a fun social network focused solely on apps. You can sign up via Facebook, Twitter or email. This allows you to find your friends or people you trust no matter what service they happen to use. AppCurious differs from other app discovery services by relying on the people you trust instead of artificial intelligence. AppCurious is a medium for communication and app discovery through the people you trust. And unlike the App Store, AppCurious gives member developers (once verified) the ability to respond to comments and post news updates on their App Page. AppCurious starts by detecting the apps on your device. You can then select which apps you want displayed on your profile, leaving out the ones you don't want displayed. AppCurious profiles not only allows you to share the apps you have on your iPhone with your friends, but also to sort them into awesome collections. AppCurious profiles also shows who you're following and whose following you. With the AppCurious news feed, you can see app activity in real time from people you follow. You can also comment and respond to updates. AppCurious app pages not only allow you to share the featured app with friends on social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Google+, but also add the app to your profile, comment on the app, rate it and love it right on the app page. AppCurious app pages are also a conduit for two-way communication between the app developer and the app users. Let's see your App Store do that!

By combining the real-time power of the Internet with a geographic clustering engine, Mix technology facilitates spontaneous, same-day, meetings between unacquainted people sharing a common interest, and does so without any user-to-user interaction.   Mix clusters individuals into small groups and then geographically optimizes the mixer venue selection to minimize users' travel distance. Reservations are received throughout the day, the clustering engine is run at 4 PM, and then users are provided with their mixer assignments telling them where to go and who they will meet at the specified time.  The user simply makes an online reservation and Mix does the rest.  Upon arrival at the mixer users can locate each other with any of three methods: visual identification, physical table markers, and electronic message delivery.  Typical venues would include bars, coffee shops, restaurants, and other commercial/public locations. For maximum convenience, users can make reservations, receive confirmations, and perform mixer check-in via cell phone.    Mix is free to join and there are no membership or annual subscription fees. Mix has a pay-as-you-go fee based business model with a per use charge (similar to a cover charge) for its products that deliver value by simplifying users' social lives and introducing them to new people through ""Instant Mixers."" However, to balance the site appeal, it also has a large free component, as ""Friends Mixers"" give users a quick and easy way to coordinate real-time get-togethers with their existing friends.    The Mix venture is comprised of 4 business platforms (Singles, Common Interest, Business Networking, and Political Action) plus a technology licensing strategy. Each of the platforms will employ the same patent pending technology in a different context. Mix will launch with its first of four platforms ""Singles"" as MixBoston.com, followed with a national rollout in other major cities, and then proceed to implement its other platforms.   Mix has a two-pronged licensing strategy, the first of which is to license its Business Networking platform in its entirety and give away its Political Action platform to the national political parties as a community service. However, since Mix can add real world interaction and revenue to any website with a virtual community, Mix also plans to provide its technology under shared net revenue agreements to topic or demographic specific websites with virtual communities. For example, Mix has initiated discussions with Eons.com to license its technology in a common interest application for the 50+ crowd. Other ideal license partners would include websites such as iVillage, ClubMom, and Major League Baseball since they have narrowly focused virtual communities that would not cannibalize Mix's core platforms.","Internet Services, Media and Entertainment",2,"Bruce Franco, William Reed",1-10,1,Seed,400000,USD,400000,400000,USD,400000,Raymond Sidney,,1,,Private,,,,,,
