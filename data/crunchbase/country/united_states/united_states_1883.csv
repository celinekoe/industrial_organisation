By 21, he had his first World Champion, Donald Curry. He went on to manage two Heavyweight World Champions, ""Merciless"" Ray Mercer, Shannon Briggs, and other World Champions. Between his late 20s and early 30s, Marc became the first person to ever take a sports management company public on the national NASDAQ, with Triple Threat Enterprises.

In just a few years, he completed over $1 billion in condominium conversions and was a partner in one of the top three condominium conversion companies in the US. Mr. Roberts then focused on assembling prime commercial properties in Miami and co-founded Miami Worldcenter, the second largest mixed-use development planned in the US. Today, the Roberts' family portfolio includes a 13+ acre assemblage adjacent to Miami Worldcenter and Mr. Roberts is the co-founder and owner of Club E11EVEN and the land on which it sits. In true entrepreneurial style, Mr. Roberts is involved in a range of projects and wrote the acclaimed 1998 book ""Roberts Rules!: Success Secrets from America's Most Trusted Sports Agent.""
