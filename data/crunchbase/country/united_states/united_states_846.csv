These cards are often expected to be written in your own handwriting, and yet they tend to be very repetitive and very numerous – and as a result, very laborious to write.  Thankster makes this process simpler by letting you type in the notes, starting with a core message that you can edit individually for each recipient, if desired.  You can use one of the handwriting styles we supply, and, if you’d like, adjust it to something similar to yours or to one you like for some other reason.  Or, you can use your own handwriting by submitting a sample to us which we then make available for you to use with Thankster.  Popular consumer uses have been wedding, Bar and Bat Mitzvah and other thank you notes, and for Season’s Greetings cards.  Using Thankster makes these tasks easier and enables you to create more personalized messages with the time and effort you save. Recently, Thankster has focused more on helping businesses with their CRM, lead generation and nurturing, and marketing automation.  For example, we have partnered with Zapier to make systematizing the sending of handwritten notes and cards much easier.","Apps, Commerce and Shopping, Internet Services, Software",1,Paul Geller,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

GSE green  energy systems, primarily alternative energy pumps, compressors and safety deceleration systems [speed sponges], operate with little or no conventional fuel while increasing the efficiency of conventional fuel usage by up to 100%.  GSE is the originator of many environmental energy designs, with patents and developmental generations of  pumps, compressors and energy redirection appliances  since 1998. GSE specializes in decentralized environmental energy sources including;  static gravity, direct gravitational phenomena (i.e. katabatic wind, hydrostatics, etc.)., and relative, or entropic sources such as animated masses (i.e. fluid flows, vehicles, animals, pedestrians, etc.).   GSE R-series, or relative gravity energy, systems leverage  energy expended by animated masses. Animated masses are entropic  sources typically absorbed, in the environment, as heat, or roadway compression (as stress  or wear).    The concept of gravity, or potential energy as a power source seems revolutionary, but it is already the source of roughly 20% of industrial scale energy production, as hydro-electrics, and related systems.  GSE technologies are a new application of DSE (dynamic state energy) systems, which include wind, solar, and hydroelectric.  An indication of the energy potentials is that roadway compression, a primary rationale for truck limits worldwide, are necessary because each heavy truck expends tremendous energy directly into the roadway and underlying support structures.  Studies show that a car traveling at 45 mph, dissipates 15-20 watts of energy into the roadway each second.  While a large truck dissipates between 150-250 watts of energy into the roadway at the same speed.","Consumer Electronics, Energy, Hardware, Manufacturing, Natural Resources, Sustainability, Transportation",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Because of HIPAA, a set of rules and regulations that define how EHR’s should be transferred, none of these systems can communicate with each other seamlessly, and as a consequence most medical records are largely faxed from one provider to another.  This is a huge problem–providers have to spend time outlining faxed records, which in turn leads to the possibility of mistakes being made in the transfer process. Our solution has 3 parts.  First, we facilitate medical record transfers through our secure HIPAA–compliant blockchain system. Then, we allow for patients to give consent to transfer their medical record through our intuitive and easy to use patient account where they can manage and accept requests. Finally, we streamline the request process for providers by automating the patient medical record request system.  This saves the provider time, money, and gives them the ease of mind that the patient's health record smoothly and securely transfers into their system. No more faxing, no more cases of malpractice due to manual data entry, just one simple to use software package that smoothly integrates into the providers workflow.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Health Care, Information Technology, Sales and Marketing, Software",1,Max Gillespie,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
