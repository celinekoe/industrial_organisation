Back in these early days, the site was still called “Tom’s Hardware and Performance Guide” and its domain was sysdoc.pair.com, pair.com being a Pittsburgh-based hosting company. The current domain, tomshardware.com, was added on September 11, 1997, followed by additional language versions, including the French, German and Italian sites, all of which are run by independent teams. Pabst moved on to other pursuits in 2008, Tom's Hardware and sister site, Tom's Guide, became part of the Purch company in 2013 and Purch was purchased by Future Plc in 2018. Today's Tom's Hardware is more than just a site for PC builders.

He decided to make more research about the industry and discovered that Nollywood Content is highly demanded for in the diaspora, and that began the journey of iBAKATV. He started in his room with a laptop, and with support from family members and friends, the company was birthed in 2011. He later brought in partners that injected some funds into the business. September 2012 marked the turning point for iBAKATV, after its acquired YouTube Premium Partnership with Four major channels, iBAKATV|NOLLYWOOD, iBAKATV|YORUBA, iBAKATV|AFRICAMAGICCLIP and iBAKATV|EVENTS, with a monthly hit of about 6M to 20m at Estimated Watch Time of about 80m to 200m as at today.

Winworks engineers worked closely with local shop owners to re-design the work order writing experience from the ground up.  Special care was taken to the flow of work for the service adviser and the growing need for comprehensive management information for owners.  The result was the Winworks AutoShop Management System introduced in February 1995 to an overwhelming response.  Since that time, we have continued the process of carefully listening to our customers, continuously improving the software to increase the efficiency of service writing while also providing valuable insight into business information.  Providing the key information in innovative ways has allowed our customers to increase not only efficiency but profitability.  We have also introduced multiple work order formats and a custom format option to allow service advisers to communicate the work done and the pricing in an effective and streamlined way.
