Their journey began with the challenges they faced in the North Dakota oil fields, where misplacing a unit or not tracking its runtime could result in several additional hours of travel. Their quest for a suitable telematics solution led them to try five different companies, but none met their expectations in terms of affordability and compatibility with their diverse fleet. Dissatisfied with the available options, they took matters into their own hands and crafted the telematics system they had envisioned. This system, Clear Telematics, is a GPS telematics device paired with fleet monitoring software, tailored to meet the practical needs of equipment owners without breaking the bank. What sets Clear Telematics apart is its affordability compared to other IoT fleet management solutions and its user-friendly design. Users can monitor vehicles, equipment, and machinery from various manufacturers all on a single dashboard. This includes heavy machinery, construction equipment, and commercial vans. Additionally, Clear Telematics offers an open API, allowing businesses to integrate their telematics data with their existing management software. The system is designed to be straightforward and durable, avoiding unnecessary features that could complicate the user experience and increase costs.

While planning his own wedding in 2005, Reid (CEO) became aware of the challenges associated with scouring the internet to find the perfect wedding photographer. With literally hundreds of thousands of engaged couples struggling each year with the same problem, and tens of thousands of wedding photographers searching for new and cost-effective ways to expand online presence and display their work online in a visually meaningful way, Reid and his Dartmouth College roommate Mike (COO) set out to solve this problem. SnapKnot was created in 2010 with the vision of infusing online technology, beautiful imagery, simplicity, and social interaction into the wedding photography industry. The end result has been a self-service online marketing platform for wedding photographers, and a free online search and collaboration tool for engaged couples that helps them quickly and easily find their perfect wedding photographer.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The company locally owned and operated in Weatherford TX, initially focused on fitness and healthcare utilities. They soon found themselves involved in the rapidly developing agriculture and livestock management application genre. The first of the series was iCattleMgr, (formerly named iCattleLog). Originally built as a prototype to replace handwritten log books that keep track of show cattle. When version 1.0 was released in iTunes they quickly realized that there is a dire need for applications like this for the agriculture industry. The response was exciting, they received numerous request for enhancements and struggled to keep up with demand. Because of this they realized the initial prototype design would not be flexible enough to keep up with request for enhancements.
