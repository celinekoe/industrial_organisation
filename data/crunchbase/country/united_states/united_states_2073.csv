The CFW franchise network has served over 3 million people to date in Kenya and is now expanding to Rwanda. A short-list of inexpensive generic drugs can effectively treat 70-90% of the children suffering and dying from infectious diseases in the developing world. Too often, people do not have access to these drugs. HealthStore seeks to improve access to these essential drugs using its micro-franchise business model. To develop a large network of healthcare clinics that consistently deliver care to the poor, all the while maintaining the standards necessary to effective treatment. <BR/>What we call HealthStore`s ""Three Point Test"". <BR/> (1) It maintains both business and clinical standards. Business standards so that the standardized business format of a medical clinic can be replicated-what is not standardized cannot be replicated. Clinical standards so that all clinics will follow the same system to ensure that the quality of care necessary to effective treatment will be consistently delivered across a large network of clinics, no matter how large the network grows. <BR/> (2) It can scale geometrically. Because the business format and clinical requirements are standardized, clinics can be readily replicated to grow into a large network. And multiple networks can be developed so that results can be scaled geometrically. HealthStore is about to license its brand to another organization which has access to millions of dollars from a major pharmaceutical company for development a large network under HealthStore`s CFW brand. <BR/> (3) It can achieve economies of scale. The larger a CFW franchise network grows, the lower to cost to serve each person. Generally, the top-down-command-and-control bureaucracies that now deliver substandard care to the poor generate higher costs per person served as they grow. Meanwhile, large franchise businesses gain economies of scale that lower costs per person served. This not only makes them more competitive but also allows them to allocate capital to never-ending improvements in service to customers. <BR/> No healthcare intervention in the developing world can deliver high quality care across a large and growing network of clinics all the while maintaining the quality standards necessary to effective treatment,unless it can pass the Three Point Test.","Biotechnology, Community and Lifestyle, Health Care, Science and Engineering, Social Impact",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
