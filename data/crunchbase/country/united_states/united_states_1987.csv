The company began as a distributor of education-oriented toys, childrenâ€™s books, stationery and souvenirs, supplying to museum gift shops exclusively.   In 1997, we shifted our focus from being a distributor of other manufacturersâ€™ toys, gifts, souvenirs, promotional premiums and published products towards the development, establishment and distribution of our own proprietary brands and products.  In 2001, the company shifted to a manufacturer model and licensed products to other entities as a principal source of income.  Historically, our principal source of revenues had been the sale of products to retailers.  In 2008, the company restructured and exited the toy business. In 2010, the company relocated back to New York and  reinvented itself as an Internet services company.
