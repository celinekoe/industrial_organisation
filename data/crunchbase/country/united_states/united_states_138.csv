Longtime friends Ryan Hart, a twenty six year old entrepreneur, and web designer Scott Dahl's conversation flowed to the success of Alex Tew's Million Dollar Homepage. Both admired the simplistic genius of selling a million pixels of ad space at one dollar a pixel, but felt that the idea could be improved upon. ""What would happen if that idea could be reapplied so that someone could 'own' the virtual pinpoints within Google Maps,"" Hart mused. ""Someone could virtually own an entire city."" Plans began forming and soon they reached the final product: MillionDollarEarth.com. Clients can now purchase one of 1,000 cities worldwide for approximately a thousand dollars each. Primary pricing is based on each city's audience or population size. Each city comes equipped with many options included on its map tab including: a Facebook fan page, Twitter feed, YouTube videos, as well as a custom text box. Unfortunately, while Hart was working through the details time stopped—or at least his watch ceased ticking. ""The first thing I am going to do is buy a watch that ticks,"" declared Hart while taking a glance at the exposed tan line on his arm. Simply putting this idea into action or buying a new watch to fill in the white stripe on Hart's arm is not the main reason for embarking on this online adventure. Both Hart and Dahl are passionate about using the platform and the proceeds from MillionDollarEarth.com to make a difference in the lives of people around the world who do not have safe water to drink. Ten percent of the proceeds will be given to Charity: Water, a non-profit organization dedicated to bringing clean and safe drinking water to millions of people developing nations. ""Online there has been no unique voice in advertising,"" says Hart.

Josh Hagler was at Target when the idea struck him. At home, his walls were bare, lacking personality. So while shopping for apartment décor with a roommate, Hagler found himself wholly disappointed with the megastore’s limited supply posters. Since he wasn’t in the market for cheesy One Direction posters or Marilyn Monroe prints, Hagler wound up taking his business elsewhere – by creating his own. At 22, Hagler, a Florida State student, is the founder of RoomScapeU.com, a website specifically designed to help college students design their dorms and apartments. That day at Target, he knew he could make something better, something that would appeal to college students. Right now, the target consumers are primarily Florida State students. Hagler explained that RoomScapeU isn’t only a website for college students to shop online--it’s a website that’s main goal is to help other people. He’s even made moves to engage local artists in the effort. Hagler envisions RoomScapeU in 10 years ranging across nation as the No. 1 online market place for college student’s room decorations and furniture. But 10 years from now, it won’t just be for college students, but also for graduated students and beyond. Hagler wants to provide a service that will grow up alongside its consumers.  “We want to be at every school who gives a dang about buying their team’s stuff,” Hagler said. “So basically every school across nation. We don’t want it to stop at just college stuff though. Let’s say we get a high school senior coming in. He’ll buy stuff from us for the next four years, but what about beyond? We want a system where we have products aimed for graduate students and alumni.”","Commerce and Shopping, Community and Lifestyle",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
