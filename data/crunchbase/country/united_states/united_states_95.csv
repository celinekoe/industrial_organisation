The mission of 1ON1 is to offer search engine optimization training to entrepreneurs, small business owners, marketing professionals, website designers, and other individuals who have a website in a format that can allow them to directly apply lessons to their own businesses and learn based on their own needs and at their own pace.   1ON1 SEO training course was designed by Bruce Jones, an SEO tutor and industry expert who realized that there existed two main flaws with SEO that were inhibiting results. First, traditional SEO services offer optimizing websites as part of a digital marketing strategy. While these can work wonderfully, the client must continue to pay for search engine optimization, or else it will overtime become ineffective, since the client does not know how to keep up with the strategy after the optimization package is no longer being paid for. Second, those individuals that are wise to seek out an SEO teacher are offered group classes where they are taught at a fast pace about general information and are not given the chance to apply teachings to their own website.   Ultimately, your best investment when it comes to SEO is knowledge and a functioning skillset which will allow you to become your own expert. That is why the best SEO training course is one that gives you individual classes and works on your own website with you, based on your goals and needs.   Online Courses with your own SEO teacher  Our service offers a comprehensive one on one SEO training with an expert SEO tutor, who uses a virtual classroom to teach individual lessons that cater to your skillset and needs. Based on your existing knowledge, our SEO teacher will adapt a course on fundamental topics, from keyword research to optimized content writing to Google analytics and more. Classes are adapted based on the individual’s business goals, current website, and learning style so that learning and benefit from each class can be maximized.","Education, Internet Services, Sales and Marketing",1,Bruce Jones,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
