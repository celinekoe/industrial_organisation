Atlanta-based NHC Beauty Enterprises, Inc. d/b/a NSP Intelligence, Inc. (NSPIntel) has embarked on an ambitious project to design and implement a managed services platform called BeautyDirect. The vision behind BeautyDirect is that it will be an integrated supply chain management system designed to secure, simplify and enable efficient purchasing integration for beauty and cosmetics businesses not owned by a mega-chain.  The BeautyDirect platform will be implemented as a managed services platform to complement and extend routine inventory management tasks at the salon level, and up to the raw materials level.  The beauty and cosmetics industry has experienced explosive growth over the years, but in many parts of the industry, it is still siloed, in some cases paper-based, and is very inefficient using its present disparate processes and methodologies. Beauty and cosmetics industry players face many competitive and operational challenges as part of doing business; by implementing an integrated system that has a solid foundation based on strong product manufacturer partnerships, the goal is to create a secure supply chain, improve the distribution process, and control as much of the distribution workflow as best efforts allow. Best-practice supply chain management features in BeautyDirect are envisioned to help connect consumer trends with product development, mitigate product diversion risks, enhance partner collaboration, improve distribution operations, and enable a seamless workflow across raw materials, manufacturing, distribution, and consumer sales.","Consumer Goods, Transportation",1,Nam Chang,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
