Launching with an initial database of over 20,000 entities across multiple industries, SpokeIntel helps drive businesses forward with its robust crowd-sourced data gathering model, paired with automatically-updated enterprise-specific news. Business professionals turn to Spoke in search of the latest company information, including executive profiles, company milestones, industry trends, news, blog posts, and much more. VBProfiles also allows business professionals to create user-friendly profiles of companies and people in a smooth and organized process that replaces existing inefficient data gathering techniques. Profiles are shared with the community at large, including peers, partners and industry experts – all able to interact and collaborate to create relevant insights about people, companies, industries and trends. What makes us different? The Spoke Intelligence Network provides a 360 degree view of an industry, industry trends, a company and its people from all the information available on the internet — no more spending hours Googling for all the different information you need on a company. Ultimately such a view across thousands of businesses enables professionals to derive insights and drive business around an industry, a trend, a company and people. Most importantly, The Spoke Intelligence Network is community-based. We believe that information on the Internet shouldn’t be simply limited to what people publish about themselves. We envisioned a collaborative space where communities can respectfully interact around companies and people outside the control of those companies and people. The Spoke Intelligence Network will become the premier network for this kind of vibrant community. We are curating information by giving the community at large the power to update profiles and provide insights. We have created a moderation platform to provide enough oversight to ensure that community-provided content is appropriate. Our focus is business information, so this will not be the venue for airing customer support issues or maligning someone’s reputation. We are doing this in partnership with companies and individuals. In compliance with our privacy policy, individuals are able to opt-out of their profile at any time. And, is doesn’t stop there. We’re regularly aggregating additional third-party information. Over time our profiles will continue to evolve with a current mix of community-supplied and third-party relevant public information.","Community and Lifestyle, Content and Publishing, Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Media and Entertainment, Software",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The team at Munee imagines a world where paying for things is easy and safe. We offer lower transaction rates, instant deposits to vendors and easy payments without needing emails, phone numbers, or credit cards at point of sale. Additionally, businesses and retailers need no additional hardware to start accepting payment from customers. With the current state of security and payments, consumers are becoming more conscious about how and where they use and store their credit card information. Nearly every online retailer requires a customer to save their payment details on the same platform used for purchasing. This creates a security risk in and of itself. Even Apple Pay and NFC payments can be compromised because the data is sent to and from the user's device. With Munee, we're providing an alternative way to pay for things--a secure digital wallet. By separating the consumer's payment method from the retailers and online platforms, the consumer is given more security and control. Using QR codes and Stripe as our processor, customers store their cards in the app (actually it's a reference to the card) and can immediately start using it to checkout at verified Munee merchants both online and offline. By simply scanning QR codes to checkout, Munee not only creates a safer method of payment but it’s much faster than any other payment platform available. From a business standpoint, we offer a frictionless and equipment-less way to accept Munee, including lower transaction fees and instant deposits (currently for U.S. based businesses).","Financial Services, Mobile, Payments, Software",2,"Nicole Garner Scott, Vaughn Dabney",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
