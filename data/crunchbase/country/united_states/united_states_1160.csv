Our retail brand AC Gears is located in the heart of Greenwich Village, New York City. Currently AudioCubes.com is the only online retailer that is sanctioned by Audio-Technica Japan and Elecom Japan to sell their domestic Japanese electronics and accessories online to consumers outside of Japan. AudioCubes.com was founded in 2001 in Boston, and was one of the first online retailers that made Japanese consumer electronics available worldwide outside of Japan. Within one year, AudioCubes expanded from consumer end goods to include high fidelity audio gear. By 2002, Audio Cubes Inc established AudioCubes2.com (AC2) to accommodate the increase in demand for high end audiophile electronics and accessories. AC2 has since then become a force of its own in making high end Japanese audio gear and accessories available worldwide. In 2007, AudioCubes moved its headquarter to New York City, and openned AC Gears - an one-of-a-kind gadget store featuring both imported and domestically made electronics that are often unavailable beyond the Internet, or on the shelves of generic big box electronic stores. At the time when counterfeits and knockoffs are rampant on the Internet, AudioCubes sources only from the original manufacturers, even with higher costs, to ensure our customers receive the latest, genuine products from Japan. Even though our products are shipped out from Japan directly to you, AudioCubes Inc is a US company, so call or email us anytime if you have questions regarding your order. Don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or a particular product in mind that you can't seem to find anywhere else.
