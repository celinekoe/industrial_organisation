In other words, having a primary bank is not necessary, thereby eliminating monthly rent charges, overdraft fees, payday loan and check cashing company abuse, and various other fee generating schemes. Utilizing a combination of various Asian ""cashless"" banking systems, like India's UPI, Dapple Pay was created to start a revolution that says, ""People do not need to pay a bank to conduct day to day business."" Dapple Pay is a small Startup created by 2 South Florida Civil Rights Attorneys who wanted to create a way to reduce the Florida's high and often undisclosed Child Support ""tax"" levied on child support payments. As their brainstorming expanded, these former financial services professionals reexamined the available mobile wallets and payment systems and realized that the over 25% of unbanked and underbanked americans, mostly Minorities and Immigrants, needed relief too. Dapple Pay Wallet was born. Upon launch, Dapple Pay will be available in iOS and Android devices. Dapple Pay can be used internationally, and where contactless (NFC) payment consoles are used. Additionally, Dapple Pay will be available in Ecuador, El Salvador, and all other locations where US Dollars are used as primary currency (except for Zimbabwe and all other OFAC banned countries.) Dapple Pay is PCI-DSS Compliant and soon will enable in-App Cannabis Sales transactions. Dapple Pay's Developers are UPI (system used in India) experts.
