Our founder wanted to know why there was no centralized retailer for all things Cannabis related. He knew that although THC products couldn’t be sold online he didn’t know why everything else Cannabis related couldn’t be. After exploring and researching this topic he found that although many Cannabis products had their own individual sites there were no sites that sold absolutely EVERYTHING. There was no one stop shop for everyone’s Cannabis needs.  The goal of Cannabist is to make EVERYTHING Cannabis related available, easy to acquire and purchase. This goes far beyond just your typical head shop items like, portable vaporizers, pipes, rolling papers, grinders, etc. Cannabist want to offer EVERYTHING! We want to offer, ALL CBD and Hemp products, including but not limited to, beauty products, cosmetics, hygiene products, sports supplements and drinks even Hemp clothing and jewelry. We even want to get into the kitchen and cooking departments by offering all sorts of different kinds of kitchen appliances that will help people cook and bake their own homemade edibles. To take that even further we want to have an entire hydroponics and grow yourself section of the website where we supply all the products, tools and step-by-step guides on how to grow your own Cannabis plants.  With all of that being said we also recognize the fact that Cannabis needs to be consumed safely and stored securely. That is why we have an entire section of our site dedicated to discrete child-proof storage containers of varying sizes. Just like how alcohol is in hard to open bottles or is locked away in a liquor cabinet, we want to provide the same security and peace of mind for our customers’ when storing their Cannabis.  The end game is to create a place where shopping for Cannabis products becomes more normalized. We want our customers to feel just as comfortable ordering Cannabis related products from our site as they are ordering products from Amazon. By creating an online retailer like Amazon to cater to these specific needs we are pushing the needle further ahead to pave the way for new businesses and brands to enter the market and to integrate Cannabis use into society even more.  In order to stay competitive with other online cannabis retailers and even conventional online retailers, we at Cannabist are constantly updating our product lists and adding new product categories. We want to cater our shopping experience as much to the consumer as possible. But it is not enough to keep our customers satisfied, we need our brands to be satisfied as well. By giving no brand any special treatment we allow smaller brands to compete and sell their products at similar rates to those larger and more established brands. There is plenty of market share to go around to include everyone. We are just as much champions of the little guys as we are for the big guys as well. Not only we do we keep our brands happy, but this allows us to offer a wider variety of products that you will not be able to get at other stores. Therefore increasing the competition between brands which results in the best possible price for you the consumer! By creating an environment where big brands have to compete with smaller brands it keeps prices at a palatable value. We know that many cannabis products can be very expensive; especially CBD products. But with this methodology we will be able to guarantee the lowest possible prices across all our brands.

ConsultADD Inc. (“ConsultADD”) is a company established in 2008. We are focused on bulk data management and data analysis.    We are an authorized reseller (both application and technology), training provider and Oracle golden partner, responsible for three main channels for the Oracle Data Integrator (an Oracle flagship product for bulk data management). First, we are an Independent Software Vendor and Original Equipment Manufacturer, providing development/demo licenses; tool kits; support services; pre-integrated open platforms; and education. Second, we are a reseller/value added reseller (VAR), providing discounts to resell; incentive plans such as rebates; and selling cost-effective complete stack/unparalleled product portfolios.  Third, we provide System Integrator (Implement, Integrate, and Consulting) services by providing education and training; support such as upgrades and patches; recognition on referrals; tool kits; and development/demo licensees. In 2011, ConsultADD developed OrMAN (Oracle Data Integration-Risk Management) which provides customized implementation solutions for Oracle Data Integrator (ODI). OrMAN caters to the constant and ever increasing problem of managing data movement.  We offer two main services to customers. First, we offer a Proof of Concept/Prototype service for a fixed price within the range of $15,000 to $50,000. The Proof of Concept/Prototype includes developing and customizing a scalable Oracle data integrator solution by gathering requirements, developing plans and prototypes, and in depth discussions with the customers. Overall, ConsultADD will spend about 30-40 hours working on the Proof of Concept/Prototype for the customer.  If the Proof of Concept is accepted by the customer, the customer has the option to further engage ConsultADD to develop the product in-house to be used by the customer in their Data Center.  The fees for this service are within the range of $150,000 - $300,000, depending on the time limitations and complexity.  Last year, ConsultADD received five (5) contracts totaling over half a million dollars.  We successfully completed engagements with Amplifi Commerce, a major eCommerce agency, for $15,000 and Chico’s FAS, a major retail store, for $15,000.  We have ongoing, multi-year engagements with several well-known customers including: PNC Bank, the 5th largest bank in the United States for services totaling $300,000; HP/USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) for services totaling $100,000; Reed Elsevier, a major publisher in science, medical, legal, risk and business sectors, for services totaling $100,000; First Data; Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd.; Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, a government-sponsored regional bank; and Bank New York Mellon.  We had a very profitable first year with revenues of $160,000.  We are continuing to develop OrMAN and we have over twenty customers interested in purchasing OrMAN.  We have a solid sales team working to increase our sales and expand our business.  ConsultADD is a rapidly growing business and we are able to offer services to customers who are unique and require specific technical challenges because of our vast industry experiences and exposure. We have established relationships with various customers who accept ConsultADD as their preferred vendor for Oracle Data Integrator, Oracle Business Intelligence and other products which compliment Oracle Data Integrator.  ConsultADD receives new customers through various channels. We receive many referrals as part of the Oracle Network and recognition as an Oracle Golden Partner.

A Tel Aviv inspired, falafel-focused vegetarian and kosher restaurant that Zagat calls “bliss in a pita.” Taïm means tasty in Hebrew. Whether it’s falafel or sabich or cauliflower shawarma, the taste is where it’s at. What began as a tiny storefront in the West Village has grown to include a second Taïm restaurant in Nolita, the newest opening in Urban Lex and two more soon to open in the Financial District and Flatiron. Taïm is the story of a hard-working Israeli chef who put her years of international cooking experience, as well as her Israeli roots, into creating a menu centered around the street food she loved.  Einat was born and raised in Tel Aviv, cooked by her mother’s side, served in the Israeli army both as a driver and ad hoc cook, went to culinary school in Israel, worked in many of the best restaurants, and ultimately went back to her roots—Israeli street food. She made a falafel recipe that bested the best in Tel Aviv. But she didn’t stop there. Einat extended her passion and skill to every mezze, salad, and smoothie on the menu. Taïm is a total reflection of Einat and Stefan’s passion, personality and unrelenting desire to make people happy with food. Crispy on the outside, warm and welcoming on the inside. Taïm has won accolades and awards for their incredible falafel through the years – the New York Times, Zagat, Time Out, Eater, NY Magazine and more -  have acknowledged the flavor and quality that will leave you craving more.","Food and Beverage, Travel and Tourism",1,Einat Admony,101-250,1,,,USD,,,USD,,Fernbrook Capital Management LLC,,1,,Private,,,,,,

(KMM), Lincoln, Nebraska and Maryville, Missouri Kawasaki was the first foreign vehicle manufacturer to open a manufacturing plant in the U.S.A.. Several far-sighted Kawasaki executives germinated the idea way back in 1974, and it was simple. If you're selling in America, why not build there too -- save time, save shipping and employ local labor. It worked, and years later firms like Nissan, Toyota, VW and Honda followed Kawasaki's lead. Since personnel are the most important part of any business, KMM strives to make working conditions safe and comfortable. Kawasaki employees, working as a team, insure that the same quality standards are incorporated through all processes. Each worker takes personal responsibility for quality and feels pride in a job well done. The consumer products manufacturing facility in Lincoln, located on 335 acres of land, has grown since its opening in 1974 from the original 286,000 square feet to nearly 1.3 million square feet of manufacturing, office and warehouse space. In 2001, the rail car plant was completed at the Lincoln site, adding 437,000 square feet for light rail car manufacturing. Over 1,000 people work at the Lincoln facilities, making KMM a major employer in the Lincoln area. In 1989 the Maryville Plant was opened for production of general purpose engines. The Maryville facility has grown to over 700,000 square feet on 113.7 acres of land employing over 600 people. KMM Research and Development Centers are located at the Lincoln and Maryville facilities to meet customer demands as quickly as possible. The plant operates on a ""just in time"" supply method which eliminates expensive warehousing and over-ordering of parts. Production methods combine the best of Japanese and American techniques, resulting in the unique Kawasaki Production System, of which we're quite proud. For instance, certain parts and pieces are made on special presses located right on the assembly line. This means no shortages or excess inventory on these items for more efficiency and less cost. In many cases, it also means the worker makes the part he assembles, and thus enjoys a full sense of accomplishment. ","Manufacturing, Transportation",,,251-500,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Jeff and Nancy Stack are the parents of a child with a rare, metabolic disease called cystinosis. On the eve of their daughter Natalie's twelfth birthday, she made a wish that no child should ever have to make; ""to have my disease go away forever"". Her wish, scribbled on a napkin because she was embarrassed to say the wish out loud, catapulted the Stacks into action. They had to share her story and formed a non-profit foundation called the Cystinosis Research Foundation. Cystinosis is a rare, genetic, metabolic disease that slowly destroys every organ in the body, including the liver, kidneys, eyes, muscles, thyroid and brain. There is a medicine that prolongs the children’s lives, but there is no cure. Prior to the establishment of the CRF, cystinosis research studies were few and far between and cystinosis clinical research and multi-year research studies were rare. CRF has raised more than $25.8 million for research and fellowships in 12 different countries making CRF the largest fund provider of cystinosis research in the world. Every day, researchers around the globe are working to find a cure for cystinosis. The Cystinosis Research Foundation is grateful to all who have supported its efforts to make Natalie’s wish become a reality.

This approach eliminates toxic carriers, permits safe dose-escalation and facilitates multi-drug deliver thereby maximizing the therapeutic index. Initially, Co-D will focus solely on its lead product, Triolimus, to treat the rare malignancy angiosarcoma, breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Preclinical studies demonstrate that their ability to eliminate toxic drug carriers while simultaneously delivering multiple synergistic drugs minimizes harmful side effects and maximizes therapeutic effects and strongly support advancement of this novel nano-medicine into human trials. Triolimus combines three tried-and-true drugs (paclitaxel, rapamycin and 17-AAG). This strategy presents a relatively low research and development cost compared to the development of new chemical entities. Co-D will develop its lead product Triolimus under an orphan drug designation to treat angiosarcoma. Co-D’s long term goal is to seek approval to treat malignancies with known sensitivity to the agents incorporated in Triolimus (e.g. breast cancer, NSCLC).
