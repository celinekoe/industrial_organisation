Easy to wear and most accurate uses patented multi-sensor technology that looks at the entire spine,"1,620,043","Greater Los Angeles Area, West Coast, Western US",Less than $1M,Active,,,,,,,For Profit,https://www.TruPosture.com,"TruPosture is the world’s first smart shirt to use our patented 5-sensor technology to measure the complete spine (T1 to the pelvis) for optimal posture training and monitoring. It’s a comfortable and lightweight sports shirt that is available in men’s and women’s styles and in 5 sizes for a perfect fit. You can wear TruPosture under your regular clothes comfortably to work on improving your posture discretely.  For most people bad posture habits start at work where they spend 8 or more hours every day sitting and hunched over a keyboard, and in most cases in an uncomfortable work environment. By 5pm bad posture has slowly set in and over time leads to back pain and other complications. TruPosture is most effective in this environment where it counts the most. It can be worn discretely to remind you to sit up and prevent the slow slide into bad posture habits and back pain.  There are no braces, straps or uncomfortable rubber bands in this shirt. The TruPosture smart shirt uses accurate feedback to help you strengthen your back muscles and core so they provide the strong support for your spine and upper body just as nature intended. Five sensors embedded in the TruPosture shirt along the spine measure the curvature of the spine accurately. During posture training you will feel a gentle vibration when your posture deviates from your healthy reference posture to remind you to straighten up. Unlike other products in the market that only use one sensor, TruPosture provides accurate vibration feedback in the area of the spine where your posture is off so you can correct and achieve the healthy double curved posture for your spine. You can set and re-set your reference posture at any time to fit your specific training regiment. Three training levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced), a selectable training timer, and programmable interval training make your posture training effective and comfortable.  The TruPosture smart shirt is self-contained with a rechargeable battery that lasts up to 72 hours. It also includes Bluetooth to connect to your favorite smart phone, tablet or computer using our free iOS and Android Apps for smart phones and tablets, and Windows App for Intel computers. The Apps help you easily set and select the various functions of the TruPosture shirt.  In addition to posture training the TruPosture smart shirt can be used in conjunction with our Apps to monitor and record your posture accurately in real-time. Use this feature to verify and improve your workspace (desk, chair, keyboard, computer monitor) to achieve a healthy and ergonomic work environment.

DayJam users are allowed to post one song, video, status/blog, photo, and a link and thus creating one combined post. Why limited post? Setting boundaries and limitations can bring out the most creativity in a human being. It establishes a canvas, It can also be a prerequisite for critical thinking, bringing out what's most important from within; a natural filter. This methodology also sets a level playing field for content to be seen, reducing the possibility of being drowned out by spam. What's Your DayJam?

PhoneTell is free to its Users.  Users need only type or speak the name of the contact they're trying to reach and PhoneTell's proprietary and patent-pending CallRank(tm) algorithms search not only scours native phone contacts, but the User's linked social accounts such as LinkedIn and Facebook and over 300M public and private business and personal listings...including thousands of ""secret"" customer service numbers assembled and hand-verified by PhoneTell to assure that human being answers the call and not an IVR system!  Search returns are User-experience informed; noting frequency, location, number of times successfully called by the User and his peers and are presented with one click to call simplicity. In addition, PhoneTell's Call Assistant services ensure the User always knows who's calling via instant reverse Caller ID, even if the caller isn't in the User's contact file...and even alerts Users to inbound calls from telemarketers.  Users can elect to return these calls when busy in a meeting or in a movie with a one-click custom SMS message that automatically lets the caller know the the call has been received and acknowledged.  It's as simple as turning on the PhoneTell Do Not Disturb feature and just turning the phone upside down.  PhoneTell even puts a reminder to return the call on the User's calendar.  What could be more useful? Finally, PhoneTell represents a major opportunity for marketers and businesses to place a highly targeted promotional message in the hands of a User who is looking for a product or service (via contextual search), physically close to the merchant (via geo-location) and ready to buy (during business hours).  This allows merchants to deliver a time-sensitive promotional message, perhaps redeemable in-store within a given time window, with zero waste, thus taking mobile lead-generation to its most useful and valuable level.","Apps, Internet Services, Mobile, Sales and Marketing, Software",,,11-50,1,Seed,1000000,USD,1000000,1000000,USD,1000000,"Ronald Conway, Scott Weiss, Cyan Banister, Matt Symons",,4,,Private,,,,,,
