In the United States, it is estimated that around 4 million people have the virus, with the majority of these cases being among baby boomers (born between 1945-1965). However, the number of new cases has been increasing among younger adults, particularly among those who inject drugs. The virus is primarily spread through blood-to-blood contact, such as sharing needles or getting a tattoo or piercing with unsterilized equipment. However, it can also be spread through sexual contact, or from mother to child during birth. Many people with hepatitis C may not have any symptoms, and therefore may not know they have the infection. However, when symptoms do occur, they can include fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, and yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice). Hepatitis C disproportionately affects certain populations in the United States, including veterans, people who inject drugs, and people with HIV. These groups are at a higher risk of contracting the virus and may face unique challenges in accessing testing and treatment. The good news is that hepatitis C is curable with the new treatments that are available such as Epclusa, Harvoni, and Mavyret. These treatments have high cure rates and have significantly reduced the duration of treatment. However, despite the availability of these treatments, many people with hepatitis C are not being diagnosed and treated. This is partly due to lack of access to healthcare, lack of awareness, and stigma around the virus. It is important for people who may be at risk of hepatitis C to get tested and for everyone to know the importance of getting tested and treated. This can help to reduce the number of new infections and improve the health outcomes of those who are living with the virus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Any visitor can create their own rating form, or to use forms already developed by the OppStreet or other members. In addition, when developing the rating form, each indicator in it can be assigned an interpretation and the weight, according to which a visitor assesses the company. When ranking the company the user selects a certain rating form and evaluates the indicators provided in it. In addition, while assessing each indicator the user can give the reasoning that would explain reasons behind the certain evaluation. The Internet contains a vast array of information on investment and often it is general in nature or is concentrated only in a narrow area. However, OppStreet application also solves this problem. Why? How? OppStreet members, by evaluating companies, can provide the reasoning for each indicator evaluated, so the OppStreet visitor can find the company-specific indicator arguments of other members and the same indicator’s numerical evaluation from 1 to 10. For example, in order to obtain information about General Electric Company's cash flow, you can simply choose a company and the indicator in which you are interested.

The production of sausage is a natural result of effective butchery. To help preserve various tissues and organs, such as scraps, organ meats, blood, and fat, sausage makers used to salt them. They'd then pack them into tubular casings made from the animal's cleansed intestines, giving them the distinctive cylindrical shape.
