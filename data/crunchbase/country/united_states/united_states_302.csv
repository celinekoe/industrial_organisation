Renovacor’s lead program is a recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV)‑based gene therapy for patients suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) due to mutations in the Bcl2‑associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) gene. Dilated cardiomyopathy is a condition affecting over 3 million patients in the US and growing steadily. Many patients develop DCM due to ischemic heart disease. Recently subpopulations have been identified that develop DCM due to mutations in specific genes that have been shown to result in the development of DCM. One of these specific genes is the BAG3 gene. The prevalence of disease‑causing BAG3 haploinsufficiency is estimated at approximately 35,000 individuals in the United States, representing an orphan disease by FDA guidelines. It is estimated a similar number of DCM patients with BAG3 mutations exist in Europe. These patients are typically younger and progress to end-stage heart failure sooner than patients with ischemic heart disease. Currently, DCM patients with a BAG3 mutation are treated with standard of care for heart failure. Despite improvements in pharmacotherapy and care, the five‑year survival of a patient with DCM is only 50%. The development of a BAG3 gene replacement therapy for patients with DCM that carry BAG3 mutations could potentially prevent the progression of disease in this otherwise healthy population of young adults.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",1,Arthur Feldman,1-10,2,M&A,41000000,USD,41000000,41000000,USD,41000000,"BioAdvance, RTW Investments, Surveyor Capital, Novartis Venture Fund, Affinity Asset Advisors",3,15,,Public,2021-09-03,,,RCOR,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/renovacor-ipo--ad69929f,NYSEAMERICAN - NYSE American

Based on 20+ years of research from the University of Washington (UW), our hybrid organic electro-optic technology enables low-voltage, low-power, high-performance transfer of data between electronics (the ubiquitous computer chip) and photonics (the technology used in fiber optics, LIDAR, and other groundbreaking technologies). NLM’s technology enables tighter and more efficient integration of electronics and ultra-fast photonics.  NLM’s Hybrid Organic EO (OEO) Technology is a patented combination of materials and process technologies, enabling efficient EO modulation in datacenter and computing hardware that meets the demand of future growth in networking for AI and other applications. Photonics is transforming networking, computing, and sensing. The largest use to date has been for data transmission and networking in telecom and datacenter infrastructure, using light to efficiently move data over fiber optic networks. Silicon photonics is the incumbent platform for integrated photonics in datacenter network hardware, but signal conversion between electronics and photonics on this platform is power-hungry and cannot scale to sufficient bandwidth to meet future needs in AI and other applications. This has created a need for alternative electro-optic (EO) modulation technologies that can be integrated with silicon photonics and address this bottleneck. Alternate emerging modulation technologies have limitations in bandwidth, device footprint, thermal stability, or cost and complexity of integration with silicon photonics and conventional CMOS VLSI electronics. NLM’s Hybrid Organic EO (OEO) Technology uniquely solves these issues. It can be retrofitted into silicon photonics processes in late-stage advanced packaging steps, minimize changes to complex chipmaking processes and infrastructure while providing superior modulator power efficiency (10-1000×) and enabling scalable bandwidth. The technology can be deployed through multiple fabs as a semiconductor IP block for broad reach, and has been demonstrated at leading translational research fabs, leading to extensive recent interest by hyperscale datacenter operators and commercial fabs. NLM’s deployment is also accelerated by strategic investors including TOK (a major photoresist manufacturer with extensive materials supply agreements with fabs) and photonics components leader Hamamatsu Photonics.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Science and Engineering",5,"Bruce Robinson, Ph.D., Delwin L.
