Creating Highways and Byways for the Digital and Autonomous World.

Local governments are struggling today with permitting disparate infrastructures that need to be a single open and intelligent infrastructure. The integration process is ready for a jump start. The country that does this well first will likely capture the preponderance of the economic benefit. Conceptually, the autonomy landscape is the cloud computing landscape writ large. The digital infrastructure at the edge needs intelligent system developers to have a market and the intelligent system developers are equally dependent on the digital infrastructure being deployed at the edge. The autonomy infrastructure permits “apps” like optimized traffic management, autonomous cars, or drones that respond to 911 calls, or autonomous delivery, or automated road and bridge inspection. The digital infrastructure these “apps” need is the public, open, locally controlled intelligent and autonomous infrastructure. The Public Infrastructure Network Nodes will support 5G wireless, Edge Computing, Radar, Sensors, Enhance GPS, and Intelligent Transportation Systems. The edge computing will convert real-time and stored data streams into information that can be used by the various apps.

Frustrated by a widespread absence of standardized dosing, or healthy edible options available at dispensaries, Ruben developed Kushy Punch’s classic organic, non-GMO full spectrum gummy. Driving the pursuit for wellness with FDA-standards of development and compliance, our gummy delivered the much-needed consistency that was famously lacking in the wild west days of pre-recreational cannabis in our home state of California.  Since then, they have continued to elevate their standards in the lab and on the shelves, investing in the highest quality oil, natural ingredients, compliant packaging and manufacturing facilities as they strive to deliver the best, most reliable experience to our customers.  Today, as the cannabis sector expands at a dizzying rate, Kushy Punch and Kushy CBD remain widely recognized amongst the most pioneering and enduring brands in the industry.

Hundreds of millions of parts are processed by CNC machines worldwide every day. The vast majority of CNC machines are still loaded by people; a tedious and dangerous job. Traditional CNC automation technology has engineering and setup costs that typically limit applications to very high volume production of a single part. The majority of CNC machines process many different parts in low to medium volumes and have not been suitable for traditional automation technology. MultiGrip was engineered specifically for mixed-part, low to medium volume production. For many CNC manufacturing applications, MultiGrip is the only viable automation technology available. Automating the CNC manufacturing process typically reduces the cost of production by 30-70% and reduces labor required for production by 50-90%. The VBX-160 is VersaBuilt's first product incorporating MultiGrip technology and was officially launched in fall of 2016. More than 40 VBX-160s are now in production. VBX-160s are currently deployed manufacturing parts for the aerospace, medical, industrial equipment, power sports, firearms and sporting goods industries.","Hardware, Information Technology, Manufacturing, Science and Engineering, Software",1,Albert Youngwerth,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Their company now employs about 3,000 people. Their corporate headquarters are located in Reston, Virginia. In the second half of 2013, Nextel Brazil commercially launched services on its wideband code division multiple access, or WCDMA, network in São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and surrounding areas and extended those services to other areas in Brazil by expanding the coverage of its network and utilizing roaming services and network sharing arrangements pursuant to agreements that it reached with another network operator in Brazil. Nextel Brazil currently offers services supported by its WCDMA network in approximately 260 cities in Brazil. Their WCDMA network enables us to offer a wide range of products and services supported by that technology, including data services provided at substantially higher speeds than can be delivered on their legacy integrated digital enhanced network or iDEN. Prior to the deployment of their WCDMA network, their services were primarily targeted to meet the needs of business customers. With the deployment of their WCDMA network in Brazil, their target market has shifted to individual consumers who use their services to meet both professional and personal needs. Their target subscribers generally exhibit above average usage, revenue and loyalty characteristics. They believe their target market is attracted to the services and pricing plans they offer, as well as the quality of and data speeds provided by their WCDMA network. They also offer long-term evolution, or LTE, services in Rio de Janeiro and continue to provide services on their legacy iDEN network throughout various regions in Brazil. Their transition to standards-based technologies such as WCDMA also gives us more flexibility to offer customers the option of purchasing services by acquiring the subscriber identity module, or SIM, cards from us separately, and by providing the customer with the option to use the SIM cards in one or more devices that they acquire from us or from other sources. The services they currently offer include: - mobile telephone voice service; - wireless data services, including text messaging services, mobile internet services and email services; - push-to-talk services, including Direct Connect®,Prip and International Direct Connect® services, which allow subscribers to talk to each other instantly; - other value-added services, including location-based services, which include the use of Global Positioning System, or GPS, technologies; digital media services; and a wide ranging set of applications available via their content management system, as well as the AndroidTM open application market; - business solutions, such as security, work force management, logistics support and other applications that help their business subscribers improve their productivity; and - voice and data roaming services outside of their coverage areas. As of December 31, 2015, their ending subscriber base in Brazil was 4.342 million.","Hardware, Internet Services, Mobile",,,1001-5000,,IPO,,,,,,,,,,1,Public,2002-11-29,,,NIHD,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/nii-holdings-ipo--80f4e468,NASDAQ
