Loop Genomics technology transforms short-read DNA sequencers into high-throughput, long-read, single-molecule DNA sequencing machines. Loop Genomics long-read DNA sequencing technology provides phased sequencing solutions across a diverse repertoire of research and clinical applications. Sequencing of partial rRNA gene sequences results in reduced phylogenetic resolution. Full-length, high-throughput, phased sequencing that covers all 16S variable regions is becoming the gold standard for profiling the microbiome. Achieve the highest resolution microbial community profiling with long-read, next-generation sequencing of the microbiome. Characterizing polymorphisms in HLA genes inside and outside of the protein-coding regions is important for organ transplantation compatibility testing and for strengthening causality association studies.  The length of homologous sequences between HLA alleles extends beyond the capabilities of short-read sequencing platforms, resulting in diploid ambiguities and a reliance on imputation.  Sequence full-length HLA DNA and/or RNA with phased, high throughput, long-read sequencing that resolves allelic discrimination and diploid ambiguity. Viral genetic variability is a major determinant of viral drug resistance and viral vaccine efficacy.  Accurately mapping viral genetic variability is a critical step in choosing the optimal course of therapy and developing efficacious vaccines.  Key mutations are typically located throughout long stretches of viral genomes, making the retrieval of critical phased data challenging using short-read sequencing technology.

RelGen captures the spinning force of the vehicle’s drive shaft through a custom center bearing. A belt transmits this kinetic energy to an alternator where it is converted into electricity. It is stored for later use to power almost any accessory – like electric APU’s, liftgates, autonomous truck sensors, cameras. The technology benefits heavy commercial truck fleets that utilize battery power for accessories. Long-haul drivers need cab climate systems to live and work comfortably. Fleets whose drivers use liftgates to deliver products and services need battery power too.  RelGen is the fastest charging system on the market and allows users to reduce fuel and maintenance costs related to engine idling and helps fleets increase uptime and profits while eliminating tonnes of CO2 per truck per year. The Energy and Combustion Research Laboratory at the University of Massachusetts Lowell analyzed our data from customer trucks to assess fuel savings and emissions reductions. Their results confirm our industry value: One Year ROI, eliminates engine idle on trucks with liftgates saves 3-5 gallons of diesel per day resulting in $3,000 saved per truck per year.

In healthy patients, valves inside the veins of the leg assist in propelling blood up the leg, and back to the heart and lungs. Affecting approximately 2.4 million people in the United States, CVI occurs when valves inside of the veins of the leg become damaged, resulting in the backwards flow of blood (reflux), blood pooling in the lower leg, increased pressure in the veins of the leg (venous hypertension) and in severe cases, venous ulcers that are difficult to heal and become chronic. Implanted into the femoral vein, the VenoValve is designed to act as a one-way valve, to help restore proper blood flow in the leg.","Health Care, Manufacturing",,,11-50,1,IPO,28000000,USD,28000000,28000000,USD,28000000,"Perceptive Advisors, Nantahala Capital Management, Kingdon Capital, L1 Capital, Velan Capital",1,5,,Public,2018-05-31,,,NVNO,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/envveno-medical-ipo--7c6455d4,NASDAQ
