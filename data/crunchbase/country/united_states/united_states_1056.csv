The animation of the logo/icon replaces the functionality of the standard waiting indicator (or loading bar.) This is a form of banner advertising. The significant benefits of Icon Advertising are: * As opposed to many forms of banner ad (which are often ignored or not seen at all) Icon Advertising receives the user's full attention. The user stares at the animation while waiting for the application to load. * Icon Advertising can be entertaining. Waiting events range anywhere from a few seconds to more than 10 seconds. In the hands of creative talent, this time can be converted into entertaining animations that help elevate a company's brand above the digital advertising noise. * Icon Advertising can be highly interactive. In the simplest form, an animation may be clicked in order to open a link. In more complex forms, Icon Advertising can represent an branding campaign with multiple animations and a high level of user interaction. * Icon Advertising does not consume valuable page space. Because it replaces the standard waiting indicator (or loading bar), Icon Advertising is transient. The advertisement disappears when the waiting period is over. However. Icon Advertising includes parameters which allow the application developer to extend the time which the animation is displayed, resulting in increased exposure. * Icon Advertising is perfect for branding activity * Icon Advertising is covered by two (2) patents which apply to the use of animated logo/icon to replace the standard waiting indicator and/or loading bar.","Advertising, Sales and Marketing",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Across America, the craft beer industry is flourishing!  Washington State, most notably Seattle, is a top 5 craft beer market  that is under supplied with local lagers, ranking 11th as a state in breweries per capita. Most beer served in the US today is a lager style, pilsner, however, most craft beer is focused on ale styles.  Ales are a flavorful and bold contrast to lagers, but are certainly not intended to be crisp & easy drinking like pilsners. ECB makes craft lager beer for those who want it all, flavorful & easy drinking! ECB primarily targets the young and social crowd, individuals with an active social life, and often stressful professional life, who frequent a wide range of venues for entertainment including, restaurants, bars, sporting events, concerts, outdoor activities and various community events.  ECB has some exciting goals for the next year! We currently offer a year-around lager, and two of four planned seasonal lagers. Our year-around lager is the only style available today in 16oz aluminum cans. The plan for the next year is to release the final two seasonal lagers and put all four of the seasonal lagers into cans. We'll then release a variety pack of ten 16oz cans that includes all five different beers styles and 4-packs of the individual style when in season. ECB currently contracts the large production batches of beer with another local craft brewery in Western Washington. This allows ECB to better focus resources on building demand for our beers, instead of investing in supply assets that make them. In the next five years, we aspire to reach 15k barrels of annual production, qualifying us a regional craft-brewery. At these production volumes, it'll make sense for ECB to either sell it's brands to a larger brewer, or to build-in it's own facility, so to recapture the production margin for our investors.",Food and Beverage,,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
