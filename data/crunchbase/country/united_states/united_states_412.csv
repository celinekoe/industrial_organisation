Have clients ever wanted to book a trip online? In the last ten years the travel industry has almost completely moved online. The hunting and fishing industry are responsible for billions of travel dollars every year. However the actual booking process is overwhelmingly omitted. My Outdoor Calendar now allows customers to book online. Hunting and Fishing business owners can now use the same technology that their main stream destination counterparts have been using for years. The system also provides management for all payments that come to the outfitters, and creates reports that help the business track sales and trends. My Outdoor Calendar offers outdoor businesses a way to create the ultimate experience for customers, whether they are booking online or using a custom built point-of-sale system. After asking John where he felt the outdoor industry was going, he explained how outfitters could enhance their product offering and take advantage of all thier existing web efforts. Price says, ""Prepare for adjusting your product for what your customers want. The company was originally set up to fix the way people booked hunting and fishing trips; but what ended up happening was much more. The designed system is used not only to help the outfitter book more trips, but to track sales, discover trends, promote specials, and manage the business."" His partner Sam chimed in, ""I feel like my job is two parts, education and implementation. You can have the coolest site in the world but if you dont have a way to monetize your traffic then you might as well not have a website at all."" My Outdoor Calendar assists guides and outfitters in their mission to grow their outfitting business through technology. Dryden states: ""There is a need to keep people in the field hunting and fishing, and My Outdoor Calendar enhances the possibilities to reach outdoorsmen, young and old, and to keep the timeless tradition alive. You have to adapt to the way the next generation of hunters spends their money."" With the introduction of My Outdoor Calendar, outfitters can now leverage the widespread accessibility of the Internet, as well as the total online booking and management package that the Calendar offers, in order to reach more customers and to make booking their outdoor adventures easier than ever. My Outdoor Calendar has already grabbed the attention of clients such as fly fishing shops, marinas, and dude ranches from coast to coast utilizing this tool to increase sales. Hunting Square, which is the parent company of My Outdoor Calendar, plans to launch the full version of its website in the near future. The new site will allow users to search for hunting trips, book online, read reviews, and many more features. John and Sam continue to keep the ball rolling by enhancing the hunting and fishing communities experience online.","Commerce and Shopping, Community and Lifestyle, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Sales and Marketing, Software, Sports",2,"John Price, Sam Dryden",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
