From a healthcare perspective, our technology allows for localized therapeutic activation with adjustable intensity. MagGenix-enabled CAR-T cells may replicate and function exclusively at tumor sites, while engineered regulatory T cells can secrete anti-inflammatory antibodies only at inflamed locations (e.g., arthritic joints). In doing so, we allow for localized immunostimulation/immunosuppression without disrupting the entirety of the body’s immune system, all through non-invasive electromagnetic stimulation. Within bioproduction, our system allows for cellular activation and modulation in batch or chemostatic bioreactors. It grants the ability to modulate, change, and halt synthesis in large-scale bioreactors with ultra-cost-efficient magnetic stimulation. Within research, the MagGenix-platform can solidify magnetogenetics as the clear successor of opto-/chemo- genetic processes to perturb and study biological systems. ​ MagGenix looks to pioneer its magnetogenetic cell therapy platform for patients, pipettes, and production.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",1,Joshua Devier,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

NLL teams each play an 18-game regular season schedule (nine home and nine away) that begins in December and runs through May, followed by the Champion's Cup Playoffs. All games are played on the weekends. Professional indoor lacrosse combines the physical play of hockey with the high scoring, fast pace, and play-making style of basketball. Indoor lacrosse is played inside the confines of an ice hockey rink, with glass and rink boards intact. The playing surface consists of a green dieter turf carpet that is laid down over the hockey ice. The two teams combine to score a total of 25 goals on average during an NLL game. Each team has five runners (forwards, transition players, and defensemen) and a goaltender on the floor during the game. Each team dresses 18 players (16 runners and two goaltenders) per game, and the players rotate on and off the floor in shifts, similar to ice hockey. The game consists of four quarters, each fifteen minutes in length. A game that is tied at the end of regulation is decided in a sudden-death overtime. There are no tie games in professional indoor lacrosse.","Commerce and Shopping, Other, Sports",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Expenses are broken down with charts, graphs, and tables. The website benefits independent travelers that desire a comprehensive breakdown of travel expenses. Travel expenses are entered by current travelers to categorize costs. This financial data is aggregated and used to develop average travel costs for other travelers estimating future expenses. Budget Your Trip is one of the first trip planning tools to use real time data provided by travelers to estimate costs and breakdown expenses on a detailed geographic and categorical level.  An upsurge in independent travel has created a demand for travel planning tools with accurate and current information. Independent travelers are scouring the web for approximate travel costs and web based tools to assist them with trip planning. The ""Gap Year"" or ""Travel Year"" concept, which began in Europe, has taken hold in the United States. Budget Your Trip meets the demands of this growing group by providing them with a tool to monitor their expenses, see their breakdown of spending, and predict future costs. The proliferation of internet availability in developing countries provides travelers with immediate access to technology and communication tools at an unprecedented level. Internet applications are now allowing travelers to stay in touch with friends and family via email, blogs, and social networks. Budget Your Trip builds on this trend by providing a budgeting tool and data gathering resource. Travelers can submit and monitor their own personal financial data from anywhere in the world. The Budget Your Trip expense tracking tool gathers data from an otherwise unmonitored group. Independent budget travelers typically use cash to purchase products and services from local businesses in foreign cities. Thus, much of their spending is not tracked or recorded by the travel industry. Budget Your Trip provides a means for the commercial travel industry to understand the spending habits of travelers that are not utilizing a travel agency, tour company, or industry specialist.","Financial Services, Professional Services, Travel and Tourism",2,"Bryan Tighe, Laurie Tighe",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
