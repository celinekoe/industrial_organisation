Beer Citizen is a new way of reviewing beers, where a beer is evaluated by quantifying the intensity of its individual traits, and reviews from other users (or “citizens”) are combined to build a beer's overall profile.  The Beer Citizen iOS app takes this data-based review model, makes it mobile, and gives citizens the added capability to publish photos of the beers people enjoy and the breweries they visit, on the go. The free app is compatible with the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch. While other beer review apps and websites often focus primarily on the issue of “how good” a beer is, the objective of Beer Citizen is to create data-driven beer profiles to answer the broader beer question of “what’s it like?” by aggregating the trait data entered with every review of a beer. To review a beer, citizens find the beer they’re sampling, and add traits to one of four main categories (appearance, scent/aroma, taste/flavor, and body/mouthfeel). The relative intensity of each trait is then entered by simply adjusting a slider to note a little or a lot of that trait. During the review process, users can also add tasting notes, indicate how much they like the beer, upload photos, and check in at a location. Other features include the ability to follow other users, beers, and breweries, to add beers to their wishlist or to their cooler, and share reviews on their Facebook and Twitter feeds.","Apps, Food and Beverage, Mobile, Platforms, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
