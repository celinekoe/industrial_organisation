With the birth of Americas Best Value Inn, he did just that, but never foresaw the industry-leading trendsetter that would quickly evolve.  Today, Vantage Hospitality Group is a full-service hospitality company that, directly or through its affiliates and subsidiaries, offers hoteliers the choice of five brands, covering the budget through upscale markets; hotel management; real estate and hotel brokerage services; and a hotel-focused insurance agency.  Throughout its expansion, Vantage has remained true to Roger's mission. Answering to its members, not to Wall Street, has allowed Vantage to continue to provide its brand members low fees and straightforward contracts, brand standards with a purpose, and A Voice and A Vote in their brand's direction. Vantage's Freestyle® model has become a hallmark of the hospitality industry, allowing hotel owners the best of both worlds - the resources of a hotel franchise and the freedom of a membership, ensuring that brand members are truly ""In Business for Themselves, Not by Themselves.""  As the company has grown, so, too, has the need to extend the Vantage philosophy beyond the economy segment. Vantage first answered with the Lexington by Vantage brand, positioned in the upscale market, and in January 2015, Vantage acquired the America's Best Inns & Suites, Country Hearth Inn & Suites, and Jameson Inn brands, and acquired and re-launched the Signature Inn brand. All new members of these brands will enjoy the same robust platform of resources that every owner should expect from its brand, while maintaining greater autonomy and more of their hard-earned money.  Roger Bloss, the longest-tenured CEO of a hotel branding company, has steered the company from its inception. He and partner Bernie Moyle (COO & CFO) are as accessible to their members as ever and are as eager to speak with the owner of a 40-room budget property as with the managing director of a publicly-traded REIT that owns a 300-room upscale hotel.",Travel and Tourism,1,Roger Bloss,51-100,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,6,Private,,,,,,

This diverse and collaborative team creates and tests the devices that are ushering in a new era of transformative neurotechnologies. Using a baby aspirin-sized array of electrodes implanted into the brain, early research from the BrainGate team has shown that the neural signals associated with the intent to move a limb can be “decoded” by a computer in real-time and used to operate external devices. This investigational system, called BrainGate (Caution: Investigational Device. Limited by Federal Law to Investigational Use.) has allowed people with spinal cord injury, brainstem stroke, and ALS to control a computer cursor simply by thinking about the movement of their own paralyzed hand. Current research is focused not only on improving the ability to operate a computer, but also on providing people with ALS, spinal cord injury, and stroke with reliable, constant control over their environment. The technology may ultimately give “natural” control over advanced prosthetic limbs, provide people with paralysis easy control over powerful assistive movement and communication devices, and, eventually, enable naturally-controlled movements of paralyzed limbs.
