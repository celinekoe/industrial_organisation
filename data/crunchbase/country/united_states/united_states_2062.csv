The HUSH Hat filters out these startling sounds so that babies can sleep longer and wake happier. Parents report that babies sleep 2-3 times longer wearing The HUSH Hat.    But it doesn't stop there. Activities where sounds can overstimulate a baby include family gatherings, noisy restaurants, sporting events, outdoor concerts, theme parks, air travel, even running errands. The HUSH Hat is comfortable enough to wear everyday and it softens the sounds of their noisy lives.    Finally, many parents are unaware that everyday sounds can actually harm a baby's hearing. Information from The Children’s Hearing Institute revealed the following: - Noise over 85 decibels is hazardous to your child’s hearing. The Institutes Recommends avoiding noise over 80 decibels. - Common sources of noise to which babies are exposed include: - Ambulance sirens- 120 db Motorcycles, firecrackers-120-140 db Noisy toys- 90 db Restaurants- 80-90 db - Alarm clocks, city street traffic - 80 db Vacuum Cleaners- 70 db The HUSH Hat will limit the upper end, potentially damaging impact of these every day sounds.    The HUSH Hat utilizes a soft, medical grade foam that has been vigorously tested by Owens Corning Labs to ensure that the product will perform as marketed.

At BTU they provide two things that college students desperately need; a scientific and objective way for them to determine what career they would enjoy and succeed at and a personal guide to help them navigate a process that is completely foreign to them and for which they have almost no training or experience…finding their first real job.     A recent Accenture study found that 61% of college graduates leave campus without a job. And if that wasn’t bad enough, only half of the employed graduates find jobs that even require a college degree. The net result is college graduates have on average over $35,000 in student debt and about 80% have no suitable job to show for it.    The marketplace for college recruiting is simply an unstructured, inefficient mess. Companies are making important hiring decisions on extremely limited and subjective information. The results are predictable. Over 40% of new college hires “wash out” in the first 18 months after beginning their first post college job. Mis-hires cost a company on average $60,000 per college recruiting failure. Many of the remaining placements are ill suited to the job function and company they join due to their desperation to find any job that can help them begin to make a dent in their mountain of debt and limited suitable job options. This lack of early career success is extremely costly both to the college graduate and the companies that hire them.","Education, Media and Entertainment, Professional Services",1,Dennis Schroeder,1-10,1,,,,,275000,USD,275000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The infant Company had no capital and was housed in one room of a bank building.  Auto-Owners operated in Mt. Pleasant for a little less than a year. In 1917, V.V. Moulton literally picked the Company up, placed it under his arm and in his pocket (the Company consisted of one book of policyholders' names and $174.25 in assets), and moved Auto-Owners to Lansing, Michigan. It wasn't long before the Depression began, and Auto-Owners weathered even the lowest point of that era - the bank holidays of February 1933. The Company demonstrated its corporate toughness and financial stability by paying all claims promptly, daily, and IN CASH! The firm was then writing more than $2.5 million in insurance premiums. Auto-Owners entered the general casualty insurance field in 1940, having previously written only automobile insurance. During the next five years, the Company found it necessary to acquire three more buildings in the vicinity of its main office to accommodate its continued growth.

Calling an electrician was out of the question -- the cost and obtrusiveness of having to re-run wiring behind the walls is nightmarish. Mike wanted a better option. After way too much time spent searching online for a product that met his needs, Mike came up empty-handed. If this didn't exist already, then the mission was clear: make it. So Mike applied to AlphaLab Gear, one of the top hardware accelerator programs in the country, located in Pittsburgh, PA, and got to work. After many hours of development, design and testing, Switcheroo was born. A successful Kickstarter campaign raised over $29k in pre-orders for over 1,000 units, proving that Mike is not alone in his desire to fix his home lighting without Wi-Fi, smartphone apps, complicated pairing/setup processes, or busted up walls.","Hardware, Internet Services",1,Mike Neilson,1-10,1,Seed,25000,USD,25000,25000,USD,25000,Innovation Works,,1,,Private,,,,,,

The powers and duties of these branches are further defined by acts of Congress, including the creation of executive departments and courts inferior to the Supreme Court. The outline of the government of the United States is laid out in the Constitution. The government was formed in 1789, making the United States the first modern national constitutional republic. The executive power in the federal government is vested in the President of the United States, although power is often delegated to the Cabinet members and other officials. The President and Vice President are elected as running mates by the Electoral College, for which each state, as well as the District of Columbia, is allocated a number of seats based on its representation (or ostensible representation, in the case of D.C.) in both houses of Congress.
