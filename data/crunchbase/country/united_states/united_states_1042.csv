Make your day special with colorful socks, bow ties and pocket squares. Wits + Beaux was founded with a single thought in mind. Where can they find a pair of well made socks with expressive patterns, at a reasonable price? The search in the marketplace left us frustrated. There was the colorful but too expensive, the affordable yet uncomfortable, and everything in between was uninspiring. They wanted to be the ones to make the perfect pair of socks that fit this criteria, and Wits + Beaux was born. The name comes from their love of the fashion and culture of Regency-Era England. ""Wits"", as they were known, were the poets, orators, and politicians of their time and the ""Beaux"" were the trend-setting gentleman of fashion. Beau Brummel's impeccable style set the standard for the modern gentleman, and this inspired us to create a line of men's accessories with a twist, to complement the personality of today's refined man. Quality for us means that they need to last and be comfortable while wearing. They noticed that most socks in the market would fall to your ankles after only a few washes. They wanted to assure their customers they were getting a pair of socks that would stay up. Their signature socks extend above the calf for all day wear without slipping down to an uncomfortable bundle around the ankle. While they started with Socks, their collection now includes colorful Beaux-Ties, Pocket Squares, and Junior Beauxs for matching fathers and sons, all created with the same innovative outlook paying close attention to the details, the craftsmanship, and choosing the colors and patterns that reflect the trends of each season.","Clothing and Apparel, Commerce and Shopping, Community and Lifestyle, Design, Other",1,Kevin Dexter,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
