It requires a group of extraordinary people who understand what it takes to be successful. We bring together the expertise necessary to succeed; we know our customers, and we have learned how to apply our technology to their problems.    At our beginning, we sought to make comprehensive acquisition lifecycle management solutions, and we have done this with the Open Acquisition System (OAS).  But we found out by listening to our customers that something important was missing that no one was addressing.  The need was contract management that supports large-scale programs by managing substantial amounts of data as an integrated system that serves a multitude of stakeholders.  nGAP does this now! nGAP TODAY Today nGAP is composed of highly skilled Subject Matter Experts, teams of highly specialized software engineers, business analysts, and researchers focused exclusively on the challenges of acquisition system automation and improvement and bringing state-of-the-art innovation to the Federal Government contracting process. nGAP’s latest innovation is called Open Concurrent Contract Modification (OCCM). OCCM is designed as a module of the OAS platform. The OCCM Module automates the change management process for large weapon platform maintenance programs inside the DOD. These large platforms include U.S. Navy Assets such as carriers, submarines, and destroyers; U.S. Air Force flight platforms and U.S. Army assets with long lifecycles that require significant maintenance and sustainment budgets.   nGAP currently offers a machine learning-based data processing, formatting, and export API microservices. The service is designed to constantly ingest, transform, and analyize technical data derived from common forms and documents.","Apps, Information Technology, Software",2,"Mark Beninger, Thomas Graham",11-50,1,Seed,60000,USD,60000,60000,USD,60000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

His innate inquisitiveness drove him to revolutionize the home wheat milling industry, taking it from stone grinding to his patented stainless steel milling heads. Like most inventors, Tom didn't stop there. He envisioned the perfect mixer using the freshly milled flour from his mill to make wholesome bread in minutes. When back in the lab, Tom developed an autoknead feature, enabling the mixer to knead the dough, develop the gluten and turn off automatically when finished. Tom continued to improve the mixer and decided to add a blender with a square jar, rather than the conventional round jar. As Tom expanded his mill and mixer business, new ideas developed. He enhanced the blender and began developing commercial blending machines just as the smoothie era began. Fast forward a few decades to the present: Tom is still inventing and the company is still growing!

A software factory is a new way to develop and maintain enterprise applications. Instead of traditional, expensive time and materials based approaches, the software factory relies on extensive standardization and automation to reduce costs and improve results.  The fundamental premise behind the software factory is that many enterprise application maintenance/development can be done using standard service types. Enterprises can now complete common maintenance tasks by “ordering” a specified number of each of these services. This level of standardization lends itself to automation – another key tenet of the factory. Development, testing, acceptance and integration processes are completely automated using standardized tools thereby eliminating manual processes.
