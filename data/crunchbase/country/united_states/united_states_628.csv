They don't know how much their case is worth, whether they will win, and if so how much money they could recover in damages. This leads them to settle for far less than what their claim was worth.

It was established in 2008 as an outcome of a Blue Ribbon Commission on ending homelessness led by then San Jose Mayor Chuck Reed and then County Supervisor Don Gage. In 2011 Destination: Home became a program of the Health Trust and in 2013 took on the role of Santa Clara County’s Continuum of Care (CoC) Board.  In this role as the local CoC Board, Destination: Home has worked with regional partners to develop a new five year Community Plan to End Homelessness.  In late 2017 the Destination: Home leadership board voted to move Destination: Home from being a project of The Health Trust to a Supporting Organization under the umbrella of the Silicon Valley Community Foundation.  Read our FAQs regarding our move to become a Supporting Organization here. The Community Plan addresses public system disruption to enhance services and efficiency, creating more housing opportunities in our land and housing-scarce community and ensuring the appropriate housing interventions and case management resources are available for unique populations, including preventative measures. This Community Plan is based on a proof of concept collective impact campaign, Housing 1000, which uses a nationally recognized Housing First model that focuses on getting clients into housing as quickly as possible and provides supportive services to ensure recovery, stability, and a decrease of public systems usage. Destination: Home drives and aligns resources to create permanent housing and sustainable support systems built for the long term. The organization is improving how systems work together to end homelessness, as well as protect individuals and families at risk of becoming homeless. In this role, Destination: Home’s Board also serves as the HUD Continuum of Care Board for the San Jose /Santa Clara City and County Metropolitan area and works with the Santa Clara County Office of Supportive Housing as a Collaborative Applicant to expand local allocations of federal funding.","Community and Lifestyle, Other, Social Impact",,,1-10,1,,,,,,USD,,Cisco,1,1,,Private,,,,,,

When you’re dealing with narrow profit margins, these fees can hurt — especially when they range as high as 7 percent in some cases. However, it doesn’t have to be this way: Global Payment Source can help eliminate your credit card processing fees altogether, allowing you to accept more forms of credit card payment (to include international transactions), which translates into more revenue for your bottom line.   When you elect to use our services, your customers will receive a flat-rate 4 percent service charge — for example, if they’d made a $50 purchase, their total would amount to $52 with the fee included. That way, you’ll never have to watch your profits eroded by ever-increasing merchant fees. If this sounds like the solution to your NYC credit card processing concerns, give us a call today to learn more. It’s a simple answer that will translate to more online sales profits flowing to you.   For all the convenience of card-based commerce, credit card processing can translate to a huge hit for NYC business owners’ bottom line — the sheer volume of profits lost to merchant processing fees can be staggering. For some methods of payment, it might be 2.5 percent — but in other cases it can often top 7 percent, never mind the additional cost for processing international transactions. However, it doesn’t have to be this way. With Global Payment Source, you can avoid fees altogether and instead pay nothing. Your customers will instead pay a negligible 4 percent transaction fee at the point of sale, regardless of payment type.   Over the years that we’ve run our service, we’ve noticed that customers almost never object to the processing fee, especially when they’re able to pay with a card instead of being forced to use cash or reach a minimum transaction threshold. It’s a convenient solution for your customers and for your business as well, and it allows you to minimize the amount of funds siphoned off for fees.   Call us today to learn more about our NYC credit card processing options. We’ll talk you through the processes and start an assessment of your business finances. If you’re a business that handles EBT, we can also help make sure that you’re getting the most profits possible. There’s no need to let your hard-earned funds disappear as a result of fees or service charges.
