Does the diet allow the flexibility to allow the member to eat whatever food they want -- does the diet allow the flexibility to adjust the diet or work with a nutritionist to input their preferred foods while maintaining their goal? Most weight in the review was put on those factors. Other criteria factored into the weighted rating are the additional features offered that allow the members to have an intuitive way to plan and monitor their nutrition and tactical priorities to get them to their desired results. The features include a daily checklist of important tasks to complete, automated charts, a daily notepad, a shopping list, and a community.
