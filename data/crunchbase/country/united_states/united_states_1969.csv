Agile's out of autoclave technology is applicable to thermoplastic CFRP, (PEEK, PEKK, PAEK), as well as many other composites including CF braid, tape and pre-consolidated laminates of varied thickness and overlap, running continuously for any width or length of material. Agile Ultrasonics is engaged in a multitude of system design projects with leading carbon fiber material makers and a number of OEM and tier-one aerospace companies.  More information on the companies can be made available through follow-up conversations. A key aspect of Agile Ultrasonics is the ability to customize and optimize the transducer and booster with the horn design to precisely control amplified ultrasonic energy whereby: higher power gives better consolidation at lower force, precise temperature control is enabled, heat is generated only at the point of consolidation, fast weld times are measured in milliseconds, scalable size, and consolidating multiple plies at the same time for higher throughput. The company has assembled a uniquely qualified team of experts to build rapid, dynamic, adaptable, ultrasonic systems. The equipment can be designed for automated consolidation of flat panels, 2D and 3D geometries, unlimited length, and continuous run processing. Our approach to tacking, placing, pre-consolidating and fully consolidating composites opens the door to lighter, thinner and less expensive final components, permitting engineers to rethink component design. Such as the optimized stiffened panel concept shown below eliminating the need for adhesives & fasteners.",Manufacturing,1,Jim Stratton,1-10,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,Rev1 Ventures,1,1,,Private,,,,,,
