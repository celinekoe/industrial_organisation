Unlike their recruiting counterparts, job seekers have few tools available to them to successfully carry out a job search.  Most job seekers, when unexpectedly thrown into the deep end of the pool during a layoff, end up devising their own ad hoc system to track all their job search information.  As a result, information is often spread across a variety of tools and websites, and much time is spent managing this data to ensure no opportunity slips through the cracks.  The time spent managing that data is time NOT spent actually finding a job.  Additionally, career coaches preach that upwards of 7 of every 10 jobs are found through professional networking.  However, most job seekers do not actively engage their network in the job search process.  So they default to job boards, where they are in competition with hundreds or thousands of other people.   JobCannon provides a CRM-style tool for job seekers to manage their contacts, companies, job postings, qualified opportunities, documents, emails, tasks, meetings, and other activities.  This unified tool ensures the job seekers spends as little time as possible staying organized.  JobCannon then provides email templates and an opt-in email system that enables the job seeker to request help from his/her network, and communicate during the job search.  This is the link into the hidden job market where jobs are found through one's network before they are ever posted on a job board.

The company produces thermal energy from five boilers located in two plants in downtown Seattle. In the fall of 2009, the company made the commitment to begin generating thermal energy primarily from a sustainable, non-fossil fuel source known as biomass. Enwave Seattle provides a heat source for use in heating buildings, generating hot water, humidity control, and sterilization. Its energy is distributed by Enwave Seattle through 18 miles of pipe under approximately one-square mile of downtown Seattle to many of the city’s office buildings, hospitals, hotels, and college campuses. In addition to purchasing thermal energy for heat, Enwave Seattle’s customers use it for a myriad of other applications. Hospitals use its high temperature steam for onsite purposes, including sterilization of medical instruments. The company’s heat source is also used for humidity control at institutions like the Seattle Art Museum, where art installations have precise humidity and temperature requirements. Several of Seattle’s artisan food and beverage producers, such as Beecher’s Cheese and the Pike Brewing Company, use Enwave Seattle’s heat source in their production processes. In the fall of 2009, the company began its conversion to renewable energy by installing a new boiler that can burn clean urban waste wood, making it possible to use renewable biomass as its primary source of fuel. At full load, the biomass boiler reduces the carbon footprint of Enwave Seattle and its customers by 50 percent, and provides an improvement to the region’s sustainability goals. Enwave Seattle was founded in 1893 and is based in Seattle, Washington.","Energy, Food and Beverage, Sustainability",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Rentricity,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rentricity,"Energy, Water","New York, New York, United States",Rentricity is a leading supplier of smart in-pipe hydro systems for water utilities.,"517,967","Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",$1M to $10M,Active,2003-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,http://www.rentricity.com,"Rentricity is a renewable electricity generator that targets water utility companies and other large fluid conveyors that install pressure-reducing valves (PRVs) within their pipelines to maintain pre-set pressure ranges.  Rentricity focuses on an innovative application of hydrokinetic power generation - electricity that is generated by harnessing energy from flowing water, such as the water that flows through municipal drinking water pipes. Water continuously flows through mains and offers the capability to generate electricity year-round, 24 hours per day. Over-pressurization occurs where water is stored at significantly higher elevation than the customers it serves, and must therefore flow downhill to reach them. Utilities and industrial manufacturers typically install pressure reduction valves (""PRV"")—usually hydraulic devices that maintain pre-set pressure ranges—to relieve the excess pressure. However, PRVs do not perform useful work with the dissipated energy.  Rentricity's Flow-to-Wire systems mimic the functionality of PRVs while converting the excess pressure into clean electric power. Wastewater, industrial outfall and recycling facilities that return water to natural bodies of water or reservoirs are also addressable using Rentricity's energy recovery systems.  Integrated sensors enable Rentricity to offer its RenFlo information services, which provide real-time system performance data, monitoring flow, pressure, intrusion and contamination while maximizing operational efficiencies. Rentricity's Flow-to-Wire systems are attractive to water utilities because water utilities currently use about one third of their operating budget to pump water. The Flow-to-Wire system provides very attractive project economics, produce between 30 and 350 kilowatts (kW)—enough to satisfy the demand of between 30 and 300 average homes, or a portion of an industrial facility. Rentricity systems are located within existing water-systems reducing permitting, installation time and environmental issues.","Energy, Natural Resources",3,"Al Spinell, Frank Zammataro, Jason Scharfspitz",1-10,4,,,,,435868,USD,435868,NYSERDA,,1,,Private,,,,,,
