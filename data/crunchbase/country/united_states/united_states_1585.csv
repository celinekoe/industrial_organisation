Surrounded by Copano Bay and Aransas Bay and sheltered from the Gulf of Mexico San Jose Island this area offers some of the best inshore fishing in Texas. These local bay systems are stocked full of all your favorite species of fish including Redfish, Speckled Trout, Flounder and Black Drum with the occasional Spanish Mackerel and other species normally found in the Gulf of Mexico sprinkled in. The crazy amount of fishing options around Rockport are pretty much unlimited which is why is has become one of the most popular destinations in Texas for inshore bay fishing and flats fishing. Copano Bay offers a lot of shallow oyster reefs and oil rig platforms that have been removed but the bases left in the bay creating some of the best structure to hold redfish and trout all year. It also has a lot of grass flats with a mix of hard sand bottoms and muddy bottoms depending on the area. These crate awesome locations to get out and wade fish. Aransas Bay offers open water reefs and channels connecting it directly to the Gulf of Mexico making it a main area during the fish and shrimp migrations creating a blossoming eco system that delivers some of the best fishing around. Some of the well-known fishing locations in the area include Allyn’s Blight, Cavasso Creek, Goose Island Reefs, Little Bay, Mud Island, Pauls Mott, San Jose Island Shoreline, Cow Chip Cove, Fence Bayou, Fourty Acre Reef and Indian Head Point. These are just a fraction of all the places locals have names for. The only problem with so many great fishing spots the locals have found and named over the years is knowing which one to go to when. This depends on all the common factors like the weather, tide flow, depth of water in the bay, seasonal shrimp migrations and a lot of other factors. The main advantage we have is we are here all year and fish these waters on almost a daily basis. This give us the edge because we can find the patterns year after year and use this information and patterns to help pin point exactly where the fish have the highest probability of being.
