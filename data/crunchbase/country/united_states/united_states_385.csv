StitZii was designed to prevent the contamination of fast food packaging, thereby improving the recyclability rates of these containers post-use. By serving as a barrier between prepared foods and the packaging containers used to house them, StitZii absorbs and traps FOG materials, neutralizing them. Learn how StitZii works. StitZii doesn’t just stop at preventing contamination of fast food packaging materials: the liners themselves are environmentally friendly and add nutritional benefits.

Their founder was an early employee at Apartment List, a San Francisco startup, and his duties included accounting & financial work. When he left after a few years to return to the Midwest, the remaining team didn’t have time (or desire) to take over the accounting back office. They needed a reliable accounting solution as they scaled, but it was still too early to hire a full time CFO or Controller. Justin agreed to support Apartment List from Ohio so that the founders didn’t get pulled back into accounting and payroll, taxes and bookkeeping still got done each month on time. With that, Apartment List became airCFO’s first client.  In the 4+ years since, airCFO has grown its presence from Silicon Valley to the Midwest.  airCFO helps angel- and venture-backed startup founders by managing the accounting back office and acting as part-time CFO, so these startups have an experienced and trusted business partner from day one.

We've seen time and again how important it is to service customers quickly, effectively, and accurately. Most businesses struggle to get customers everything they want and need when they ask for it. CSMs spin their wheels with data pulls, engineers that should be working on product have to come up with quick queries, and there's no time to service the long-tail of smaller customers that are all trying to gain value from your business or product. That's where the idea for Locusive was born. Our goal is to create an AI assistant that feels like a guide or concierge for your business. For users, it's about streamlining those moments of ""how do I...?"" and turning them into ""oh, that's how!"". And for the CSMs, it's about filtering out the noise, letting you focus on the deeper, more strategic aspects of your role. We're on a journey to blend technology with a bit of that human touch, making the digital space feel a tad more navigable and friendly.

Cario has created an end-to-end, secure and private distributed ledger technology solution. This allows all participants in the title transfer and management process -  including DMVs, dealers, wholesalers, commercial lenders, captive lenders, insurance companies, taxing authorities, auto repair firms, and consumers - to seamlessly participate in any title transaction.

At Saia LTL Freight, our relationship with our customers isn't quarter to quarter, we're in it for the long haul. Saia's Core Values Customer First Doing what it takes, in everything we do, means putting the customer first. It doesn’t mean short-changing safety, policies or procedures, or respect, but it means understanding that fundamentally, our customers are at the heart of our business – in everything we do. Safety Safety is not a policy or procedure. Safety is a fundamental behavior and practice. It is the unified practice that we can efficiently and effectively all work safely and perform our functions to support individual employees and company goals. Taking Care of Each Other Teamwork, empathy, and giving 100 percent. Taking care of each other means leaders caring about employees, employees caring for each other and for customers, and everyone at Saia caring about the company's purpose and goals. Dignity and Respect Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. Every employee at Saia has a sense of worth and value that they bring to their role at the company. We must all recognize the humanity in each other and treat others respectfully. Do the Right Thing Doing the right thing means making the conscientious choice, the ethical choice, even when no one is looking. Doing the right thing demands commitment to excellence and an awareness that why you do something can be as important as what you do. Community As a company and as a team of employees, we must embrace our responsibility to our neighbors, the environment, those with whom we work, and the communities that sustain us. We realize that it is always easy to talk about being a good citizen and yet it is another to put words into action. QUALITY MATTERS A concept often discussed but seldom defined. Not at Saia. For us, as well as our service groups, quality is everything that goes into creating and a positive customer experience.  It is the positive tone in our voice when you call and the care with which we handle your shipments.  It means showing up when we say we will and delivering your freight as promised.  Quality involves every employee, whether they interact directly with you or not, and influences every decision we make as a company. At Saia, we have developed various signature programs and initiatives to ensure consistently high quality that continues to improve.",Transportation,1,Fritz Holzgrefe,10001+,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

With our focus on fun, safety, convenience and good sportsmanship, i9 Sports offers traditional kids sports leagues without the traditional headaches! Some key features of i9 Sports: - All skill levels welcome - No tryouts! No drafts! - Everyone plays – every game! - No fundraisers of any kind! - No mandatory volunteering! - One day per week - practice is conveniently scheduled prior to the game. - Trained officials at every game. Our mission is to help kids succeed in life through sports. There isn’t a better tool to teach a child the skills necessary to succeed in life than sports. Self-discipline, determination, teamwork and good sportsmanship are only a handful of the many valuable life skills learned through sports participation. Unfortunately, anyone with a ball and a whistle can offer a sports league for kids, and many kids leave organized sports because of a negative experience. Research has shown that the number one reason kids play sports is to have fun. It is not surprising then, that the number one reason they quit playing sports is because they stop enjoying it. Our goal is simple: to put the fun back into youth sports.","Community and Lifestyle, Education, Gaming, Sports",1,Frank Fiume,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

As a USA based design house, the company has continued to enhance the value of its brand and its offerings by extending its capabilities in the rapid design and prototyping space.  This coupled with it's turnkey manufacturing model has help improve Noitavonne's position in the global space as one of the preferred vendors  for mobile device design and development,     Since 2012, Noitavonne:tm: has an established a growing presence in China, Europe, the Caribbean Islands, Brazil and the United States.  The company's alliance with Siecom Communication & Technology Co, Ltd proved beneficial to both parties.  With designs created by Noitavonne's and the capacity of Siecom the companies enjoyed two solid years of growth, ending the year on high notes being sited as one of the fastest growing Design houses in Asia.  The NoitSiecom marriage fits merged its image in late 2012 to embed its USA design team in its logo appropriately designed by Noit's Founder, ""Lael Alexander"". 2014 kicked off with Noitavonne being named one of the most Innovate Companies at the Consumer Electronics show, where it could be scene in action boasting designs for its customers and brands like Aston Martin, Alcatel, Delphi, Blu, HSBC, Sony and more...  CURRENT EXPANSION PLAN 2015 Market expansion efforts are underway to establish an even greater presence in the United States. Domestic consumer product launches with companion service packages are scheduled for late fall 2014.  This will be the first direct to consumer product launch that the company has made.  A multi-pronged market saturation plan incorporating, public relations, advertising, strategic marketing/partnership development, viral marketing, social media, consumer sales and B2B sales initiatives is in the final stages of development.  Two of the markets targeted by  Noitavonne:tm: are Smart Appliances and Wearables which both have a tremendous long-term potential for growth.  Noitavonne of course has had the Joystick project in development for almost 2 years now and anticipate that chip-set makers may have finally caught up with their creation in order to make it feasibly viable for the consumer market to adopt.     FUNDING ROUND Noitavonne has never received any venture round of funding through any agency or institutional investor.  The company's momentum has been perpetuated by  its ability to create unique Id's and form factors for clients that are wiling to push innovation to the edge and can afford to pay for it.   Noitavonne is still privately owned and operated with its Original Founder and members in place.  No part of Noitavonne has been sold or allocated to any of its affiliates abroad or domestically.   Past Post (2011-2012) The Spirit of Noitavonne:tm: is best expressed through its very name which is “e-nnovation” spelled backwards. It is the technology house where innovations merge with possibilities and transform into an experience. The company’s patent pending “LOOP Connectivity Protocol” has become just one shining example of the high level of technological innovation that is produced at Noitavonne:tm:. Another is “The Loop Tablet”, which has many capabilities including cellular, computing, video, e-Reader, music and controlling wireless IR remote applications. The device acts as a phone or it can be a smart phone companion where the cell phone wirelessly displays in the Loop Tablet User Interface allowing the user to perform all the cellular phone functions in addition to the full spectrum of tablet functions. The visionary behind this product, Lael A. Alexander, has a knack for building upon ideas to continually improve on what others might deem perfection. However, it is his experience in technology that spans decades and crosses multiple functional industry sectors ranging from healthcare to energy related segments that continue to prove up his concepts from a practitioners approach. Currently, the company is focused on the launch of its developed line of products including the Noitavonne:tm: A357 series of Android smartphones; The Noitavonne:tm: Loop tablet which comes in two sizes (7” & 10”) and the company’s premier tablet, The Noit:tm: Embrace which won “Best In Show” at the CTIA Wireless Technology conference. All products are set to debut 2012-2013. In an ever changing environment, the last forty years has led to a rapid pace of technological advancement leaving consumers to shed personal computers for tablets, landline phones to smartphones and physical storage units to the “cloud”. However, the breakthroughs that Noitavonne:tm: has innovated will advance technology with lightening force into the realization of connectivity beyond the space age. Noitavonne:tm: finds itself on the cusp of one of those great moments, the birth of a new breed of technology, the Microsoft and Facebook moment when the intangible becomes tangible and the impossible becomes reality.","Hardware, Mobile, Software",1,Lael Alexander,11-50,1,Seed,250000,USD,250000,250000,USD,250000,,,,,Private,,,,,,
