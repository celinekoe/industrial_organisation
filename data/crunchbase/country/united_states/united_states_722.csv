The year was 1988 and programming of Morse Data's second software product, BookMark, began. State of the art for the time, BookMark meant that Morse Data customers were running the same software application, which allowed Morse Data to upgrade customers with new features, thus extending the life of the application and giving their customers long term value for their investment. By 1992 Morse Data Corporation had doubled in size and BookMark was a leading order management system across the country. By 1995 big changes taking place in software in parallel with the light speed success of Windows. By 1998, Morse Data decided to author a Windows-based application. In 2001 Morse Data introduced InOrder - a new product launched into the heart of the ""dot com boom (and bust.)"". ""That was one tough storm to weather as a company,"" Morse said.
