Masimo is best known for its pulse oximetry technology, Masimo Signal Extraction Technology® (SET®) — which today is considered to be modern pulse oximetry. Masimo SET® addresses the limitations of conventional pulse oximetry, such as its poor performance during patient motion or low perfusion. Founder and CEO Joe Kiani was inspired to develop more reliable, accurate technology after observing ineffective pulse oximetry in the neonatal care unit (NICU).  Masimo’s pulse oximetry is at the heart of many of its monitoring devices and products. In 2023, SET®’s origin — as a way to more reliably monitor NICU babies — came full circle with the introduction of Masimo Stork™, a baby monitor that uses SET® and other advanced technologies to help parents track their babies’ health indicators at home. In addition to Masimo SET®, the company has developed numerous noninvasive measurements (collectively known as the rainbow SET® family of measurements), a suite of advanced devices like the Root® patient monitoring and connectivity platform, many other innovative bedside, handheld, and tetherless devices, and remote patient monitoring and management solutions like Masimo Patient SafetyNet™ and Masimo SafetyNet  These devices and solutions help caregivers monitor numerous physiological parameters including blood oxygen saturation (SET® SpO2), total hemoglobin (SpHb®) carboxyhemoglobin (SpCO®), fluid responsiveness (PVi®), methemoglobin (SpMet), respiration rate from the pleth (RRp®), brain function while sedated (SedLine®), regional and cerebral oximetry (O3®), cardiac output (LiDCO™), end-tidal carbon dioxide and other capnography measurements (NomoLine®), acoustic respiratory rate (RRa®), and more.  Masimo also develops therapeutic products like Masimo softFlow™ which delivers respiratory support to patients with spontaneous breathing. Additionally, Bridge™ by Masimo is a non-drug device that alleviates symptoms of opioid withdrawal through neuromodulation — making recovery safer and easier. Masimo also offers the first FDA-authorized device to alert users in the event of an opioid overdose, Opioid Halo™, and wearable devices like the Masimo W1™ advanced health tracking watch.

Since cell therapy is currently produced for a single patient at a time, it is expensive to manufacture, requiring significant time and resources, and is difficult to scale.
