We notice that they are many migrants, many overseas students, and many corporate professionals on oversea assignments. One of them was Andy, a 32 years old Singaporean Chinese who lives and studies in Canberra, Australia.  He was not able to find authentic Singaporean food in his place. He wanted to find a sense of belonging with his community and food is the source of connection. The only solution was fast food restaurants and food outlets that were expensive and lack that sense of connection. He got stomach cancer scare due to lack of rest compounded by the fact that there were only Macdonalds and Domino pizzas within 3 km of  his workplace and home. Throughout his work life across Germany, China, Singapore, Thailand, Australia and Malaysia, he was seeking for that solution. Till one day, he was in a student dormitory that held multicultural festival in which he experiences connections and understanding through sharing food with people from all parts of the world. He figures that such festivals are occur only sporadically and wander what if this can happen anywhere anytime with anybody. Along the way, he met G, his long-time friend who recently his job as a leader of a global investment bank to operate his food franchise. G realize that chefs who are employees will never be as motivated as self employed chefs. However, not all chefs are good business managers and running food business on a scale can be risky.  Most chefs want to be lifestyle entrepreneurs instead of big time entrepreneurs. They want to choose who to cook, when to cook and how to cook. As such, food meet and match is born. Vision We aim to instil a sense of community belonging for foodie and a sense of economic empowerment for chef anywhere, anytime with anyone of the same group in any context. Everyone who have go overseas for more than 72 hours gets to experience the goodness of foodmnm once in their lifetime. Mission We aim to reach this vision by: 1.	Enabling you to find your authentic food with your own people wherever you go at anytime 2.	 Empowering you to have a lifestyle by cooking and sharing with the community 3.	Ensuring our practice are sustainable  Why food meet and match? 1.	100% localized your way: You get to find and pickup the specific food you want. 2.	100% 24/7 access:  You get to find more than just fast food outside odd hours 3.	100% unlimited choices of food: You get to choose more food than any possible food menus","Community and Lifestyle, Food and Beverage, Internet Services",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

FTFun, based in Jersey City, NJ was conceived just as Steve Jobs, the CEO of Apple, introduced FaceTime to the world at WWDC - 2010, on June 7, 2010. The service was launched on June 26, 2010, only two days after Apple's iPhone 4 was released. FTFun is a FaceTime Community that was created with the initial purpose of simply allowing iPhone 4 (now including iPod Touch and Mac) users to try out the FaceTime feature of their device. It uses a Web Application to connect its users. As of October 23, 2010, the FTFun service released an App in the Apple App Store. FTFun's population of users has since grown to span over 80 Countries (Top ten: United States, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, China, Canada, United Kingdom, Spain, Mexico and Australia) History At WWDC 2010 Apple initially announced their groundbreaking FaceTime technology that would forever change how we commonly use video conferencing. Two days after the launch of the iPhone 4 and FaceTime the founders of FTFun launched what they would hope to be the first FaceTime Community on the web. Since its inception, FTFun has steadily grown in terms of its user count. Furthermore, the service continues to regularly refine its main web application. Since its launch, 50,000 unique visitors have been reported to have visited the site with over 6 Million page views to date. Application and Release The free FTFun! App was released onto the App Store on October 23, 2010. After a long awaited approval process, the 0.3 Version was uploaded and had over 350 downloads on just the first day of its availability. The FTFun! App enables a community member to access the FTFun service and all of the features of the Web Application from the convenience of an iOS application that can be downloaded for either an iPhone 4 or a 4th Generation iPod Touch. Technology The iPhone 4 features a front-facing VGA camera as well as a 5-megapixel rear-facing camera, which is capable of recording HD video in 720p at 30 frames per second. These cameras provide the means for FTFun's services, as users enter FaceTime chats with other online individuals of their choice. Currently, FaceTime functions only in combination with a Wi-Fi connection, as there is no official 3G (UMTS/HSPA) data support at the moment. FaceTime can only work by connecting an iPhone 4 to another iPhone 4, 4th Generation iPod Touch or FaceTime for Mac; the previous generations of the iPhone are not supported.",Sales and Marketing,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
