It is designed for the millions of cyclists, local retailers, and small and large manufacturers around the world who are constantly creating, buying and selling, new and used bicycles, parts, accessories and gear. Our platform solves the problem of no existing single marketplace for individuals, retailers, and small and large brands to buy and sell their new and used items, and create brand awareness in a single common persistent marketplace of like minded buyers and sellers. The  platform is designed to connect buyers and sellers in a community of liked minded cycling enthusiasts which is local, national and international in scope. We are particularly interested in the opportunity presented by operating at the nexus of the transaction between buyers and sellers, in a community of passionate users. The platform does not take the place of existing social networks rather it leverages all the current existing hooks which allow users to create accounts using their existing social profiles and get viral distribution back out through these social networks. While initially focused on the passionate cycling enthusiast marketplace, the pedalr platform is by design one that can be easily ported to other verticals creating a nearly limitless market for processing the transaction and subscription SaaS opportunities. pedalr derives income from a percentage of each sale, premium accounts and placements, strategic partnerships with local and national brands, traditional advertisement, and ultimately software as a service.","Commerce and Shopping, Software",2,"Andrew Korf, James Hayden",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The RabbitRack system is heavily vetted and highly scored by industry specialists, MIT and Baylor University.   We want to make this point “perfectly clear”… right from the very start…  It is NOT our intention to manufacture the RabbitRack…   As you will see… This project is much bigger than we are…  It’s a game changer…  It will require a major industry player or champion in the industry… It is our intention to refine the concept, develop the prototypes, and finish the UL Approval process to improve the RabbitRack’s monetary valuation prior to its sale. A key component to advancing the sale value of the RabbitRack is centered around its Patent Protection.  While we currently hold a US Patent on the core technology (and we have several other patents that are currently pending) it is our desire to file a landmine field of patents around those currently filed.  In addition, since the international of the RabbitRack exceeds the US potential, it is our desire to file an array of international patents to bolster the sale value of the RabbitRack IP. Our investors can anticipate a relatively quick exit strategy with a significant ROI from the initial sale of the RabbitRack…  More importantly, investors can anticipate long term “follow on” royalty payments…   It is our intention to structure the sale of the IP with an irrevocable link to the RabbitRack registered trademark.  In doing so, the royalty payments will not expire with the Patents 20 years from now, but continue through perpetuity.
