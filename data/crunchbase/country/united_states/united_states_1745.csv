NTellers LLC,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ntellers-llc,"News, Social Media, Software","Los Angeles, California, United States",NTellers is a website and mobile app that combines social media with news reporting in an innovative way,"3,232,064","Greater Los Angeles Area, West Coast, Western US",,Closed,2016-05-25,day,,,,none,For Profit,http://www.ntellers.com,"NTellers is a website and mobile app that combines social media with news reporting in an innovative way. NTellers was developed to give young Americans, as well as young people around the world, a new kind of platform for promoting peace, hope and optimism.   Ntellers was Created by two visiting students from different corners of the world, NTellers will provide a new kind of platform for discussing and promoting what really makes America great – diversity, tolerance and opportunity. In recent years, many people have seen an erosion of the ""American Dream,"" coupled with a rising surge of negativity in politics. The goal of NTellers is to help the younger generation recapture this dream and push back against the mistrust and paranoia that have gripped politics and society. The NTellers website and mobile app will officially launch on July 7.   ""We share an admiration for the American Dream and all it represents,"" says NTellers Co-founder Bachir Gueye. ""But fundamental changes in society have jeopardized that dream. People with a positive outlook on life and the world seem almost to be a minority today. That's why we created NTellers – to give likeminded people a place where they could gather with a sense of purpose, and a belief that together they can change the world.""   Multiculturalism has long been a defining characteristic of America, but recently the melting pot has approached a boil – stoked by politicians looking to score points with fearful constituents. In the last year, Donald Trump has been the self-appointed ringleader of this regressive, reactionary movement. According to a column in U.S. News & World Report, Trump taps into a trifecta of fears that haunt many Americans – China's economic power, Mexican immigration and Islamic State terror.   A recent Pew Research Center survey showed that only 35% of Americans hold a favorable view of China. Meanwhile, 36% of Americans have a negative view of Islam, while almost half of American Muslims said they experienced racial or religious discrimination in the past year, according to Gallup.   Fear, as most people know, is frequently built on ignorance. Many surveys and studies consistently show that people who know the least about Islam or immigration or foreign trade are likely to be suspicious of them – and that's despite research showing the important of immigration to the national economy, to use one example. NTellers' mission is to prove that hate speech and exclusionary ideologies have no place in today's world.   Gueye and Nass see Twitter, Instagram, Vine and the major news outlets as their key competitors. Because the news media is so corporate in nature, though, the stories that see daylight often skew negative. Uplifting stories that show humanity's potential to live in harmony simply don't attract the same number of eyeballs and clicks. NTellers looks to change that by providing a more complete picture of the world, and creating a community where people can share stories and discuss topics that matter right now.   ""NTellers is more than a phone app, and more than a platform for people communicate,"" concludes Founder Mohammed Nass. ""It's a new way of telling news that matters and communicating across borders to make the world a better, happier place. We firmly believe NTellers will be the next big thing in news and social media, and we encourage everyone to stay tuned for our launch on July 7."" NTellers aims to Give American and Global Citizens a Platform to Fight Back Against Hateful Speech and Ideologies.","Content and Publishing, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Software",1,Mohammed Nass,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Using a matrix system that both the job seeker and the recruiter completes, the matching technology will then send the matched resumes to the recruiter.  At that point, the recruiter can review and contact job seekers for additional information.  The system performs matches throughout the day as new positions are posted or edited.  This website will  greatly reduce the sourcing time for recruiters. As for job seekers, they no longer have to sit in front of the computer submitting resume after resume.  The system will do this for them- if they actually qualify for the position.  The system will also generate a very basic PDF formatted resume for the job seeker to print and use for interviews.
