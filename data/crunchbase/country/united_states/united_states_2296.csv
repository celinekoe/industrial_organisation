For many years, the company's stock in trade was roofing asphalt, shingles, felt, accessories, and a small metal shop for fabrication. MG initially serviced the metropolitan Baltimore area with just 5 employees and approximately 7,000 square feet of office and warehouse space. MG grew steadily, albeit modestly, until 1979, at which time former ownership began to grow the company more aggressively. Over the following years, MG worked hard to strengthen its partnerships with many of the major roofing manufacturers and expanded the product mix to include commercial roofing products and sheet metal goods. The company also developed meaningful relationships with several key commercial roofing accounts in the metropolitan Baltimore and Washington, D.C. area and expanded its delivery capabilities to include rooftop loading. These efforts enabled MG to grow revenues nearly 10-fold over the 25-year period between 1979 and 2004. In 2004, management led a series of initiatives to further leverage MG's strong vendor position and position the company to realize its next, accelerated stage of growth. In March 2004, MG expanded its physical footprint beyond Baltimore, opening a second facility in Herndon, Virginia. During this timeframe, the company also invested heavily in personnel, fleet, equipment, and systems in order to better serve its customers. In October 2007, Morris Ginsberg was acquired by N.B. Handy Company, a privately owned company based in Lynchburg, Virginia. N.B. Handy is one of the country's largest independent wholesale distributors of commercial roofing products, sheet metal, precision metal fabricating machinery, and HVAC equipment and supplies. More information about N.B. Handy In July 2010, MG moved its branch facilities from Lorton, Virginia to Chantilly, Virginia to better serve their customers. Their two facilities are strategically located to service customers throughout the greater Maryland, Washington D.C., and Northern Virginia area. Their workforce consists of approximately 48 committed employees, including outside and inside sales professionals, drivers, equipment operators, material handlers, and dispatch personnel; as well as support from NB Handy in product management, marketing, procurement, credit, and accounting. They maintain a modern and efficient fleet of vehicles, forklifts, and rooftop loading equipment. They offer a comprehensive portfolio of products from the industry's leading manufacturers. All of these resources are dedicated to ensuring that they consistently deliver exceptional service and bring superior solutions to their customers.","Manufacturing, Real Estate",,,,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

As support for covering arcades had almost completely dried up in game magazine circles and by only getting an occasional glance on mainstream gaming websites, there was very little to find in the way of news for coin-op video gaming. You could find news for specific genres if you knew where to look but no one was really diving into the news for the industry at large and that needed to change. The site first started off with two members, who wrote articles under the aliases Pointything and Twisted Supreme, both based in the UK. It wasn’t long after the site started that the premier arcade industry newsletter, The Stinger Report headed by industry expert Kevin Williams, began to contribute stories and articles to AH. Stories and links provided by Stinger Report are accompanied by the Stinger Report banner in every post and they have sent in over 1000 newsfeeds at the time of this writing.  In April 2007 Shaggy joined the editorial team and was followed that year by MetaFox and SaraAB87, all three of whom are in the US. The latter two have stopped posting to the site but Twisted and Shaggy were joined by UK poster Heavy Electricity in February 2008.   Each post features the title of the author underneath the headline in case you are curious as to who is posting what. Other major contributors have included Phil Arrington(US), Aaron Auzins(US), Kieran May (UK) and Oga Shi (Japan); Eric ‘ECM’ Mylonas(US) ;as well as marketing directors from every company involved in producing games in the arcade industry. We also would like to thank everyone who has provided tips to us in the past. We also appreciate it when sites who discuss the news we break give us credit for it as that is simple netiquette. In May 2010, the ownership of the website was transferred over to Shaggy, aka Adam Pratt. In addition to being an avid arcade fan, he also owns and operates his own arcade location in West Valley City, Utah called The Game Grid Arcade, thus providing a perspective to arcade news from the point-of-view of a player and an operator.  Arcade Heroes will continue to provide news about coin-operated video games, pinball machines, new arcade locations, arcade game reviews and more. Where other game sites choose to ignore arcade releases unless it happens to carry some big name with it like Guitar Hero or Metal Gear, we seek to cover everything, even if it is obscure.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment",1,Adam Pratt,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
