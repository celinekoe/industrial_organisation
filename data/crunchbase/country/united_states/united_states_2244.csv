Jay, an owner of J's Tailor & Cleaners, began his journey in 1970 in Seoul, Korea. At 14 years old, Jay had no choice but to drop out of school and immediately seek employment in order to eat, find housing and provide for himself. He eventually found employment at a custom-made suit shop in Seoul’s downtown area, where he started off as nothing more than an intern, bringing the coffee and utensils that professional tailors needed. Slowly, but surely, he began to learn how to make patterns, cut fabrics and sew pockets. Eventually, through observation and diligent study of fashion books, he learned how to make full custom suits. By the age of 23, he became a custom designer and tailor, designing, fitting, making patterns and crafting masterpieces. At the age of 29, Jay moved to New York with only $100 in his pocket. Jay found employment in New York at a dry cleaners as well as a sewing and manufacturing company, where he met Jackie, his current wife, and mother of their three children. One year later, Jay moved to Dallas, Texas. After another six years working in another tailor shop, Jay had saved enough to open his own business. In 1991, Jay and Jackie founded J’s Tailor & Cleaners. Jackie and Jay have been together for over 30 years, and co-own J’s Tailor & Cleaners. Since the opening of J’s Tailor & Cleaners, Jay has gained the loyal business of numerous individuals within the Dallas area, even including a handful of celebrities. Jay has over 40 years of experience as a tailor and cleaner and provides his customers with unmatched expertise through each of his family-owned business’s services.

His mission was to establish a truly collaborative relationship with clients, providing publishers with an alternative to cookie-cutter composition services. The result is a company that works closely with clients to produce high-quality books and journals using the latest proven technologies along with time-honored principles of publishing. What Makes Us Kinetic? Our small size allows us to respond quickly to changes in technology and to tweak our processes to meet the unique needs of each of our clients. We named our company Kinetic because we regard that flexibility as one of our greatest strengths. Rather than force you to conform to a large, unwieldy process that may not suit you, we work with you to create the most efficient process, and we continually strive to improve that process. Because of our size, we don’t have the high volume that some of the larger comp houses have, but we would rather succeed in delighting a handful of loyal and happy clients than struggle to satisfy scores of them. Our Staff Our small staff of 10 has a combined experience of over 100 years in publishing, and each staff member has a variety of experience. It’s likely your project manager has a background in layout, your typesetter is an expert in XML, and your copyeditor has done project management. This depth and variety of experience means we can spot inefficiencies in a workflow as readily as we can spot typos and hyphen stacks.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment",,,11-50,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
