For $14.95 per month and 30 minutes each quarter, anyone can build and manage their own ETF portfolio and grow their money like the world's smartest investors. Traditional wisdom suggests that being successful in the stock market is about picking the right stocks or hiring the right financial advisor to manage one's money.  Study after study proves, though, that it's not possible to ""beat the market"" with any consistency, and that the most successful investors ride the market by allocating their assets across broad sections of the market and re-balancing when their asset allocations get out of whack.  While mutual funds purport to do this sort of thing, they typically charge investors 2% or more off the top, whether they're making money or not, and have tax implications that are often unfriendly to investors.  Over time, these taxes and fees can erode 30-50% of an average portfolio! MarketRiders allows investors to take control of their own money in a three step process as follows:  1. User inputs data points such as age and risk tolerance, and based on those factors, MarketRiders suggests a portfolio based on ETFs (low-fee index funds typically associated with buckets of stocks or commodities).  User can customize the portfolio or copy a successful portfolio from another MarketRiders user. 2. MarketRiders sends user a lists of trades to make at his or her online broker. Once user confirms purchases and prices, MarketRiders begins monitoring user's account for necessary changes based on rules and alerts that user can configure.  3. MarketRiders watches each user portfolio and alerts user when he or she needs to make changes.  If for example, a user wants to maintain 10% in coal, and coal makes a run such that 15% of the user's portfolio is now in coal, MarketRiders suggests the necessary trades to bring the portfolio back to the desired asset allocation.",Financial Services,3,"Mitch Tuchman, Ryan Pfenninger, Stephen Beck",11-50,1,M&A,200000,USD,200000,200000,USD,200000,"Stephen Beck, Mitch Tuchman",,2,,Private,,,,,,

When combined with cancer immunotherapy, CytoCure's drugs will enhance patients' ability to recognize and destroy their own malignant tumors. CytoCure scientists have discovered a process by which tumor cells lose expression of genes encoding immune targets. This process of ""antigen silencing"" is a common finding among tumors. CytoCure scientists have shown that the loss of these antigens is often due to reversible gene regulation. Proprietary CytoCure technology is based on overcoming tumor-produced factors that induce loss of tumor antigens, thus assuring that the tumor cells continue to express the antigenic structures that will allow the immune response to destroy all tumor cells in the tumor mass. Since the loss of tumor associated antigens currently represents a significant limitation to the success of cancer vaccines, the re-introduction and/or up-regulation of antigen expression will be a necessary adjunct to these therapies. Although the anti-tumor immune response can be markedly enhanced by strategic vaccination, the ability to destroy the tumor is dependent on the continued expression of the target antigen. CytoCure's technology provides for a platform to assure the continued expression and regulation of ""antigen silencing"" to enhance immunotherapeutic treatment of cancer.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
