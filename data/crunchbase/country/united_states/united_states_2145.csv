Snocap,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/snocap,"Content, Content Delivery Network, Music","San Francisco, California, United States",Snocap is a digital rights and content management company helping content owners register their content and set business rules.,"651,895","San Francisco Bay Area, West Coast, Western US",,Closed,2002-01-01,year,2008-02-01,day,,none,For Profit,http://snocap.com,"SNOCAP was a digital rights and content management startup founded in 2002 by [Shawn Fanning](http://crunchbase.com/person/shawn-fanning)(creator of the original Napster file-sharing service), [Jordan Mendelson](http://crunchbase.com/person/jordan-mendelson), and Silicon Valley investor [Ron Conway](http://crunchbase.com/person/ron-conway).  Fanning, Mendelson and Conway founded SNOCAP in the days immediately following Napster's demise. Many of the company's employees, including its COO, [Ali Aydar](http://crunchbase.com/person/ali-aydar), were veterans of the original Napster team. SNOCAP's initial focus was on developing technology content owners (in particular artists and labels) could use to register their content and set business rules controlling where and how that content is available on the web. SNOCAP eventually secured deals with all four major labels (Universal Music Group, EMI, Warner Music Group, and SonyBMG Music Entertainment) to register their content in SNOCAP's digital registry.  SNOCAP's ultimate goal was to license this technology to file-sharing services, enabling a new wave of ""legal P2P"" services that used SNOCAP's technology to track and filter music sharing within a network, blocking registered content that labels & artists didn't want shared but allowing sharing of anything else. While two file-sharing services, Mashboxx and Grokster, signed up to use SNOCAP's technology, their SNOCAP-powered services never launched. In late 2006, SNOCAP and [MySpace](http://crunchbase.com/organization/myspace) announced that they were partnering to give independent artists and labels a way to sell music on MySpace through SNOCAPâ€™s MyStore widgets. Eventually, over 110,000 artists signed up to sell their music through MyStore widgets. These early experiments were a precursor to MySpaceâ€™s efforts to sell downloads directly to consumers through its [MySpace Music](http://crunchbase.com/organization/myspace-music) venture.  In March 2007, SNOCAP announced it was partnering with the social media site [imeem](http://crunchbase.com/organization/imeem) to track music being played on the site and share ad revenue with artists and labels, utilizing SNOCAPâ€™s content fingerprinting and digital registry technology. The goal was to provide a way for consumers to upload and share music with their friends, for free, and to do so in a way where label and artists can both make money and have greater control over where and how their music was available. imeem rolled out this new offering in June 2007. In April 2008, imeem acquired SNOCAP, confirming rumors first reported on TechCrunch two months earlier. That acquisition reunited several members of the original Napster team, including SNOCAP's then COO, Ali Aydar, who is now imeemâ€™s COO. Aydar was a key early advisor to imeem and served on its board of directors from 2003-2007. imeem continues to operate the SNOCAP digital registry, and uses the technology acquired from SNOCAP to power imeemâ€™s ad-supported streaming music service. SNOCAP was backed by Ron Conway, Morgenthaler Ventures, WaldenVC, and Court Square Ventures. In total, the company raised over $25 million in funding from WaldenVC, Morgenthaler Ventures, and Court Square Ventures.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio",2,"Jordan Mendelson, Shawn Fanning",1-10,4,M&A,27400000,USD,27400000,27400000,USD,27400000,"Morgenthaler Ventures, Amicus Capital, Ronald Conway, Walden Venture Capital, Court Square Ventures",2,6,,Private,,,,,,

We’re the online leader for health insurance alternatives to Affordable Care Act insurance (“ACA” or “Obamacare”). As a nationally licensed health insurance agency and A+ rated by the Better Business Bureau, we stand by our mission--to offer consumers the most comprehensive and simple-to-use platform for comparing the private health plan options that you will not find on the government websites like Healthcare.gov. Agile Health Insurance offers Obamacare alternative health plans: Short-Term Health Insurance - major medical insurance that can be obtained any time of year and protects you in case of injuries or illness. Health Benefit Insurance - Indemnity insurance that pays you a set amount for doctor and hospital services. Dental Insurance - Agile has partnered with some of the best dental insurance companies in the country to help keep your mouth happy and healthy. Telemedicine - you can speak to a doctor 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, administered by Teladoc, the nation’s leading provider in telemedicine services. All of the health insurance plans offered on our site have several important advantages: Usually less than half the premium cost of Obamacare plans. More freedom to choose preferred doctors and hospitals. Can be purchased year round with no blackout dates or Open Enrollment Restrictions. Are underwritten by financially strong entities who are committed to the highest level of customer service. We know shopping for health insurance online can be a difficult, confusing, or a downright opaque experience, so we created the Health Insurance Learning Center to provide answers to common problems experienced by consumers. Buying health insurance with Agile, you can feel confident that you purchased your health plan from a team of experienced healthcare innovators. We were founded by the same team that pioneered the very first online sale of health insurance in 1999 and collectively, we have helped millions of consumers get coverage. Our team also created HealthPocket, the only website where consumers can compare every Obamacare and Medicare health plan in one step. Please visit HealthPocket.com to compare your Obamacare options.
