The opportunities for the workplace were endless, but so were the challenges. Technology was embraced by many business owners; and feared by many others. The potential was obvious, but it was also obvious that the business world would now require new levels of technical expertise to properly integrate the potential of these emerging technologies into every day functions and more importantly, growth opportunities. Sea Change had a vision. It was unrealistic for most small businesses to hire the required talent; and it was unlikely that existing staff could be trained to learn and keep up with what was proving itself to be constant changes in what technology brought to the table. Small business owners needed outside help and Sea Change would fill that void. They assembled a talented team of certified Information Technology professionals with backgrounds in a number of diverse markets, and the Sea Change approach to IT was given purpose. Since then, so many things have changed and yet so many things have remained the same. PCs virtually exploded. Software became more sophisticated than most could ever imagine. Networking, wireless applications, security, servers, file storage, etc. became issues to be addressed. And now, new and varied devices are offering a glimpse of the next generation. Today, just like in 1993, many small businesses have the fears of managing their office technology in a way that increases short-term productivity and long-term success. Some have trained their staff; some have hired in-house IT personnel, and some need outside help. Virtually for all, there is a place for the team at Sea Change Systems.",Information Technology,,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

This video game publishing company was based out of Austin Texas and was founded on the idea that Gamecock Media didn't need to micromanage its developers. Wilson, Stults, and Miller were no strangers to the video game industry. The three had previously worked together to create Gathering of Developers along with Doug Myres and Jim Bloom. G.O.D., as it was usually called, had the same hands-off approach that the three later brought to the company. However, in 2000, Take Two purchased G.O.D. The founders were not happy with the new management, and after Myres passed away, the three negotiated a release from Take Two. Several years later, the three decided to form Gamecock Media Group to once again offer developers the chance to work without a lot of management. In addition to this approach, they offered to let all independent developers retain all rights to their intellectual property. This meant that the company didn't make as large a profit off material associated with each game, nor could they develop the property into a series themselves. However, it made more developers willing to work with them.","Content and Publishing, Gaming, Media and Entertainment",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
