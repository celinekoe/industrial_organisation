When a birthday comes up, everyone with that birthday on their list will be reminded with one simple tweet.  They can send a tweet to that person from within TwellWishes or they can send a virtual gift such as a cake or a comfy pair of slippers. The idea came about after noticing there was no way to keep track of followers' birthdays.  Facebook users get that information automatically, but on Twitter users are only likely to know of another user's birthday either from seeing others tweeting about a birthday or if they actually know that person offline.  Furthermore, people usually end up with some kind of gift for their birthday, so TwellWishes includes a virtual gift store.  Users can send gifts with either credits or cash (via PayPal).  Everyone is given 100 gift credits upon signup to send at least one free gift.  When users run out of credits, they can easily purchase more.

In short, we are an e-commerce company with proven track record of changing the way how individual services behind Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions are promoted and contracted. We have started our quest back in 2013 with the most difficult challenge in event management – weddings – and solved broken process of their cancellations. As most of you know, weddings are expensive, very personal and therefore very difficult to handle. Canceling them isn’t much cheaper. Only in the US, each year 13 % weddings get cancelled making it a market worth $7bil of the total $55bil wedding market. Our secondary marketplace project CanceledWeddings.com offers unique social brokerage features for wedding service contracting, negotiation and secure transfers to cost savvy couples. It’s a win-win for everyone because the selling couple doesn’t lose all their money sunk in nonrefundable deposits and cancellation fees while the buying couple gets a really good bargain. At the same time, wedding service providers have now a simple solution how to deal with wedding cancellations and unsold late availabilities. They don’t lose a date that they weren’t able to sell at full price and even enjoy new incremental revenues. But wait, it’s not all only about e-commerce of weddings and honeymoons. If you look around at how different market segments and whole industries have changed due to the Internet and the network economy, you realize that for the MICE industry to adapt, it has to change. We, at TRACTIMO, are here to disrupt the status quo and enable this change.","Commerce and Shopping, Events, Media and Entertainment",1,Peter K. Ulrich,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
