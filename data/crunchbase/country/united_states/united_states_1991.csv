It is within this fringe of gold that Kilconquhar lies.  The inhabitants of Fife are known to be 'fly' and even their hens are supposedly so cunning that they do not cackle when they lay an egg.  Their ancestors were Celts whose descendants now occupy only the Highlands of Scotland and parts of Ireland, Wales, Cornwall and France, where they speak modern forms of the original Gaelic language. This language lives on in Fife only in place names and in the names of rivers and other natural features.   Druids, at the time of the occupation, often marked their places of worship with standing stones, some of which can still be seen at Lundin Links, not far from Kilconquhar. They were converted in the course of the Fifth and Sixth centuries to the type of Christianity practiced by St. Columba on Iona and spread by his missionaries. These missionaries were known as Culdees, one such being Conquhar or Connacher who founded a cell or church which thereafter became known as the cell or church of Conquhar, that is Kil-conquhar, pronounced in local parlance as Conneuchar. The site of this cell is where the present church stands.   Modern Kilconquhar clusters around its church, which was bestowed on the convent of North Berwick in the year 1200. It is mentioned as existing as early as 1177 and is dedicated to St. Monan. The nuns of North Berwick made regular visits to their church at Kilconquhar, travelling via the village of Earlsferry (of which more later ) and the ruins lying to the East of the present church at one time formed part of a church used and built by them in the 15th century. When the existing Gothic church was being built in 1821 and the old one removed, the foundations were found to be twelve to fifteen feet below the surface and immense quantities of human bones were uncovered, both from within and out with the building. The site had evidently been used for a long time for burials, and although there is no proof that the Druids used it for this purpose, it is supposed that they did as we shall see later.",Real Estate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
