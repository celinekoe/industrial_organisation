Computrols designs, manufactures, and services state-of-the-art building automation systems throughout the U.S. and abroad. With over 35 years in the industry, Computrols has established a solid reputation as a leader in automation systems for large facilities. High-rise office towers, military bases, hospitals, schools, data centers, and government monuments across the United States and the world benefit from the power, simplicity, and reliability of Computrols building automation products. Through our branch offices and dealer network, Computrols continues to grow its customer base and distribution channels, as well as expand its product line into new markets. In 1983, Computrols began providing first-rate professional technical service for large building automation systems. These were the formative years for Computrols. A complete dedication and commitment to customer satisfaction provided valuable lessons that would carry the company for years to come. Computrols learned that simplicity, flexibility, and power were the cornerstones of success in the building automation industry. And it’s this first-hand knowledge of what’s important to customers is what continues to drive Computrols product development today. In an effort to gain better control of the systems that Computrols was servicing, we began developing our own building automation software known as CBAS. We found software development to be a tremendous mechanism for implementing our company philosophy. Through a simple yet powerful software design and an array of 3rd party interfaces, the software package brought Computrols a host of new customers and opportunities. Even though there are many parts to large networked building automation systems, the software brings a face to an otherwise complex collection of components. That’s why Computrols continues to dedicate tremendous focus and resources to our software products and CBAS remains the flagship of the Computrols product line. Customers who use CBAS enjoy a first-class driving experience. Not only do they feel the power of controlling their building’s operations from the convenience of a high-powered CBAS workstation, they actually enjoy it. With the success of our software, Computrols decision to begin designing and manufacturing our own line of electronic controls was simple. So in 1993, we launched our electronic design department. Since that time, Computrols Electronics Engineers have remained loyal to the company’s mission of simplicity, flexibility, and power. They continue to produce controls and automation products with the same quality that Computrols customers have come to expect from their service and software divisions. And because senior management oversees all user-related aspects of electronics products–from keypads to LCDs, from usability to ease-of-installation–Computrols products continue to reflect the same values upon which our reputation was built. In recent years, there has been a flurry of activity. Computrols has expanded into new international markets, launched a successful dealer network, and targeted new market segments like retail chains and small commercial properties. But through all of this, Computrols has still managed to push the envelope in research and development. Web-based controllers, wireless products, and advanced energy management techniques are just a few of the recent developments. For Computrols, the future is brighter than ever. With a solid commitment to great customer service, cutting edge software, state-of-the-art electronic controls, and a continuing passion for an ever-evolving industry –success is certain. Great things are in works, and Computrols is committed to providing their customers with the latest technology and continued excellence in service.","Energy, Real Estate",1,Roy Lynch,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Peter ended up getting a digital marketing internship in Boston, and Max was a waiter in Cape Cod. Neither of us could believe there were no local jobs we could find. So, we started investigating where all these jobs are. It turned out, most of the companies in Vermont are small, as in less than 10 employees. These businesses don’t normally hire students for internships because internships are often too big of commitments. They do need help executing marketing strategies, making graphics, and communicating with customers, but they can’t afford that for 30 hours a week.

Sellers save time (by not calling around for quotes); they achieve maximum hammer price (by selecting the right expertise); and they save up to 50% on seller fees.  Meanwhile, auction houses are rewarded with a robust inventory pipeline with zero marketing costs, which they can access 24/7 to maximize revenues for each auction.
