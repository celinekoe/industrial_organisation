It's a new way to search that takes advantage of the size and bandwidth of today's Internet and the increasingly visual way that we all interact online.  The idea for Searchme came when Mark Kvamme, Searchme's chairman, got tired of looking through a bunch of unrelated results for articles on motocross. He suggested to founders Randy Adams and John Holland that they create a search engine that sorted results into categories.  The Searchme visual interface came about when Randy, a father of seven, helped his four-year-old son search for children's web sites that he'd seen on TV. It struck Adams that if a search engine could show big pictures of the pages it found before users clicked through to a site, it'd be much easier to quickly find what they were looking for.  After more than three years of engineering, imaging billions of web pages, and fine-tuning our approach many times over, Searchme was born.","Advertising, Design, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Sales and Marketing, Software",2,"John Holland, Randy Adams",51-100,6,Late Stage Venture,43600000,USD,43600000,46914300,USD,46914300,"Sequoia Capital, DAG Ventures, Tenaya Capital, Randy Adams, Mark Kvamme",2,8,,Private,,,,,,
