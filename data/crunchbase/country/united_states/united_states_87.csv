The Anesthesiology Refresher Course Lectures, the genesis of the Dannemiller Foundation's Anesthesiology Review Course, began in 1953 when Dr. Arthur B. Tarrow moved to prepare Air Force anesthesiologists for the board exams. In 1970, Dr. Joseph Dannemiller, their namesake, was informed that the Air Force could no longer continue supporting this event. Dr. Dannemiller then founded the Society of Air Force Anesthesiologists to ensure the continuation of this important educational meeting. The Dannemiller Memorial Educational Foundation was formed in his memory in 1984. In 2009, the company changed its name to Dannemiller, Inc. Dannemiller has grown to become a leader in continuing education and has been an accredited educational provider by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) and California Board of Registered Nursing (CBRN) for 30 years. In the most recent survey by the ACCME, Dannemiller was awarded Accreditation with Commendation, the highest honor of accreditation by the ACCME, and their status as a provider was extended through 2019. In 2009, Dannemiller became accredited by the American Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP), Accreditation Council on Pharmacy Education (ACPE), and the Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR). Dannemiller is comprised of: doctors (MDs, DOs, PhDs, and PharmDs), nurses (NPs, RNs, PhDs, & CRNAs), JDs, educators, instructional designers, continuing education accreditors, publishers, editors, meeting planners and coordinators, and a comprehensive IT and audio/visual support team. With roots in Anesthesiology and Pain Management, Dannemiller continues to expand its offering to a wide range of specialties in the medical and supporting communities. Although Dannemiller is widely known for its own continuing medical education (CME) activities, namely their Anesthesiology and Pain Review Courses, they also partner with other educational entities to provide credit for a combined total of more than 250 medical education programs and over 90,000 credit hours in a broad range of subject-matter each year. They are proud to offer these programs in a variety of educational modalities such as live, print, and interactive online formats. Program evaluations document that over 95% of Dannemiller CME activity participants learn something they will incorporate into their profession, meaning that they are hugely successful in producing positive results among activities intended to improve participants’ competence in their profession. Dannemiller.com is owned and operated by Dannemiller, Inc. who funds the content on this website.
