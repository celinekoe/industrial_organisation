By institutionalizing lessons learned from the Inc. 500 successes and applying those principles to the tech-transfer industry, the company properly addresses the needs and solves the inefficiencies of the current system. Using techniques prevalent amongst the fastest growing companies in the country, and then improving upon these based on real-world lessons, The Incubation Factory has successfully established two tranches of portfolio companies and is in the process of creating a third tranche. 1993 – 2003: TIF Tech Fund evolved from Anthony, Allan & Quinn, Inc. (“AAQ”) which was founded in 1993 by AAQ’s current CEO Dan Schmitt and two partners. AAQ successfully launched eight companies from 1993 to 2003, three of which grew rapidly enough to qualify for the Inc. 500 List of the Fastest Growing Private Companies in America. In 1997, recognizing a tremendous need and opportunity for streamlining back office claim processing for the healthcare industry, AAQ founded Advanced Business Fulfillment (“ABF”) to serve insurance companies, managed care organizations, HMOs and third-party administrators. By 2003, ABF ranked No. 23 nationally and No. 1 in Missouri on the Inc. 500 List. In July 2003, ABF was sold to publicly-traded WebMD for $260 million. Through this experience AAQ performed an in-depth study of their Inc. 500 peer group, analyzing what made these companies successful as well as why other companies fail. These findings created an opportunity to introduce a paradigm shift in the innovation process, as it was discovered that companies make the same mistakes and missed out on the same opportunities across industries and businesses.","Financial Services, Lending and Investments",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
