It's flagship product, TuneUp has quickly become the #1 selling plug-in for iTunes that also supports Windows Media Player, and has amassed millions of registered users worldwide. Founded in 2007 by avid music lover and industry leader, Gabriel Adiv, TuneUp was born out of personal frustration with the shortcomings of his own digital music library. He had too many songs titled ""Track 01"", no cover art, and no easy means of accessing additional album, artist or concert information. Everything he loved about his vinyl and CD collection was lost in translation, as the digital music industry scrambled to catch up. TuneUp Media develops products to not only address these issues, but also tap the broader digital and social media universe to create an experience far beyond anything Gabe could have found in his liner notes. Now, millions of digital music consumers around the world have used TuneUp to clean up and organize their music metadata, intelligently find and remove duplicate songs, fill in missing album cover art, explore their world of music and share it with friends. Best of all, TuneUp works ""automagically"". Behind it's simple interface lies cutting-edge acoustic fingerprinting technology, backed by the Gracenote's MusicID, the world's largest database of music-related metadata, boasting over 90 million indexed tracks.","Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio, Software",2,"Gabriel Adiv, Raza Zaidi",11-50,3,,9300000,USD,9300000,9300000,USD,9300000,"Ridge Ventures, KPG Ventures",2,2,,Private,,,,,,
