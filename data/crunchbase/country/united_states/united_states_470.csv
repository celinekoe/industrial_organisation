The first edition primarily focuses on the mitral valve  This unique educational tool of the 21st century contains four independent components:  Historic Review, Current Status, Case Study, and News and Events. The Historic Review is organized into the following four sections: The first section describes in a Mitralvalve 16th-century chronologic approach the development of knowledge of the structure and function of the heart, circulatory system and subsequently the diseases of the heart with a particular emphasis on the mitral valve. In this section we analyze the work of major contributors from the European Renaissance until the end of the 19th century. Briefly, the Mitralvalve/16th century can be viewed as the century of descriptional anatomy. The development of the science of experimental physiology with the discovery of blood circulation took place in the Mitralvalve/Girolamo-fabrizzi, 17th century. During that era, the science of histology was established and microscopic observation played a critical role in our understanding of the physiology of the circulation. The first pathological reports appeared toward the turn of this century with description of ossification of the cardiac valves. The Mitralvalve/Raymond-Vieussens, 18th century witnessed the birth of anatomo-pathology and a great emphasis was placed on the correlation of clinical symptoms with autopsy findings. Finally, during the first half of the Mitralvalve/Antoine-portal, 19 century, great progress was made in physical diagnosis with the broader application of percussion and the invention of stethoscope. The second section describes the development of Mitralvalve/Stephen-hales diagnostic tools such as sphygmography, Mitralvalve/Wilhelm-conrad-rontgen X-ray, Mitralvalve/Willem-einthovent electrocardiogram Mitralvalve/Claude-bernardcardiac catheterization and more recently Mitralvalve/Inge-edler echocardiography. For each technology, we have provided the developmental background and then analyzed their applications in the diagnosis of the diseases of the mitral valve. This section covers primarily an era extending from the mid 19th century to the seventh decade of the 20th century.  The third section entitled, Mitralvalve Guillaume-de-baillou disease specific focuses on the development of knowledge pertaining to the specific etiologies of valvular heart disease. We have described in a chronologic manner the progress which was made in our understanding of the most common causes of mitral valve disease namely Mitralvalve/Guillaume-de-baillou rheumatic fever, Mitralvalve/Lazares-riviere infective endocarditis, Mitralvalve/Channing-frothingam degenerative disease and Mitralvalve A-le-piez ischemic cardiomyopathy.  The fourth section is entirely devoted to the birth of Mitralvalve/overview mitral valve surgery in the 20th century. It is important to stress that the selection of the authors and their work(s) has been based on major medical bibliography references. We have read and analyzed their work using the primary sources in almost every instance. They were extracted from a large personal collection on the history of cardiovascular medicine. In addition to this source of information, some of the recent material and images are reproduced from other origins. Every attempt has been made to ensure that such material is only used after the permission of the publisher. Finally for each author, we have presented the entire title of the first edition of their work(s), a portrait (if available), the frontispiece and the title page. Along with the description of their work, appropriate illustrations, of museum quality, and book excerpts from the original text are displayed. We have attempted to provide a translation in English or French for authors whose text was published in Latin. The Mitralvalve/fundamentals Current Status analyzes the state-of-the-art knowledge of predominant etiologies of mitral valve disease. For each etiology, we have described the clinical presentation, pathology, diagnosis with a particular emphasis on echocardiography, and modern treatment with a specific focus on surgical indications and management. The last two components, Mitralvalve/archives Case Study and Mitralvalve/news, News and Events, are self-explanatory. They will be inaugurated in fall 2011.","Education, Health Care, Software",,,101-250,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Such actions of CHESAKL ENTERPRISES, INC. can only be characterized as fraudulent manipulations. Yet when Mirkamel Vafaev requested reimbursement from the business soon after his injuries, he was turned down. Vafaev's damages as a result of CHESAKL ENTERPRISES, INCnegligence .'s were not accepted as compensation by the company. Mirkamel Vafaev was compelled to file a lawsuit to safeguard his interests after making numerous vain attempts to settle the matter of damages peacefully. Vafaev filed a lawsuit on or around July 9, 2015, requesting damages for his injuries.  There are increasingly unscrupulous entrepreneurs in the construction market who conduct suspicious and, sometimes, dangerous activities for their contractors. Unfortunately, among such activities, organizations and corporations seem to be practical and lawful at first sight. A typical example of a dishonest company is CHESAKL ENTERPRISES, INC. from New York, where one can observe the hype for several years. Most of it is negative commentary, accusations of fraud, and illegal activity. There is not a trace of a good reputation left. CHESAKL ENTERPRISES, INC. manufactures steel structures that form the base of foundations for all structures – buildings, infrastructure, and green areas. The company also performs installation and decorative metal work, dumpster removal, and demolition. The construction industry, like no other, provides opportunities for hiding financial and other frauds: a vast number of suppliers, contractors, and subcontractors, a long construction cycle, and many instances to go through from the start to the finish of the next project. The executives of CHESAKL ENTERPRISES, INC. and a team of dubious lawyers have worked hard since the organization’s beginning to give the company a real name and a positive business reputation. But it turns out that the experience and competence of the staff were needed to preserve their reputation. Unprofessional management allowed negative incidents to occur and, trying to fix them, creating new ones. Eventually, like a snowball, so many problematic and contentious situations accumulated that it became impossible to resolve them. Instead of trying to rectify the case, for example, by hiring more experienced and qualified lawyers and managers, the company created legal schemes to cover up illegal activities. To preserve and maintain the reputation and transparency of CHESAKL ENTERPRISES, INC., the company began opening new companies that were essentially the same thing but with a different name. The fraudulent activities of such shell companies generated numerous lawsuits, with lengthy proceedings spilling over from one court to another. Many cases were never finished, and the rest ended not in favor of the “daughters” of CHESAKL ENTERPRISES, INC. Mirkamel Vafaev sustained a significant injury on May 27, 2015 as a result of CHESAKL ENTERPRISES, INCnegligence .'s and fault. Vafaev contacted corporate executives after his injuries in an effort to get the insurance coverage to which he was legally entitled.",,,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
