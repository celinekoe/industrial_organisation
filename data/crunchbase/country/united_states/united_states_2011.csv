Urologists also get patient referrals through their mobile app. ClariFlow is the first home test for BPH. Developed over 10 years by researchers in Europe and clinically tested around the world including UCLA, ClariFlow lets you test for maximum urinary flow rate, which is one of the indicators of BPH. Simply preorder the kit online here. Itâll get shipped to you in a discreet package. In conjunction with your symptoms checklist, the easy-to-read gauge will tell you if youâre at risk for BPH. BPH is short for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia. It means that your prostate is enlarged and this may cause problems with you ability to urinate. For example, you may feel that youâre urinating more frequently than before or that youâre unable to urinate completely. Perhaps your urination interferes with your ability to sleep through the night or youâre getting more urinary tract infections. These are all potential signs that you may have BPH. BPH is very common. Half of men over 50 years old experience this condition, as do 75% of men over 80. Even men in their 30s can begin to experience the symptoms, so you or your loved one is far from being alone. Early diagnosis of BPH is really important. Once you and your doctor know that you have BPH, there are medications that you can take to reduce the need for frequent urination and the uncomfortable feelings associated with BPH. Finding out early also reduces the chances that youâll need surgery later on to correct for your symptoms. And lastly, itâs always a good idea to rule out more serious conditions, such as prostate cancer, as soon as you can, because they sometimes present similar symptoms. BPH can be easily treated if diagnosed early. If left untreated, it can lead to urinary tract infections, incontinence, urinary retention, and other unpleasant symptoms. Extreme cases may call for the use of a catheter in order to empty the bladder, or even surgical intervention.",Health Care,,,1-10,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,StartUp Health,,1,,Private,,,,,,

The site features over 5,000 individual timeshare properties for rent, often at 30-50% of their standard nightly rates. In addition, via a partnership with World Choice Travel, a division of Travelocity, the site offers access to more than 27,000 hotels and resorts at the same guaranteed low prices.  Timeshare units are denoted by a ""gem"" icon, and include top providers such as Marriott, Wyndham, Hilton, and Disney. The startup has raised over $1.1 million since inception, with backing from State of Ohio funded initiatives, Ohio TechAngels, and other high net worth individuals. Once a user finds a hotel, resort, or timeshare they like, they can book it online in minutes. Hotels and resorts booked through the Travelocity network are handled in the same way they are on Travelocity. When a timeshare ""gem"" that has been listed by its owner is booked, all aspects of that transaction are handled by Resort Gems, from payment and contract to the handover of keys. This escrow-like fashion eliminates risk for the consumer, much like StubHub does for tickets. Resort Gems does not charge timeshare owners to list, and makes money by taking a percentage of each timeshare transaction, or via standard partner kickbacks from Travelocity on resorts and hotels provided via their feed of 27,000+ units. The company slogan is... ""Stay at a timeshare, without the sales pitch."" Resort Gems has been featured in USA Today, Travel + Leisure, Peter Greenberg, Fox 28 News Columbus, and The Columbus Dispatch. On June 8, 2010 they won an international startup competition held by Weblogs & Mahalo founder Jason Calacanis, tying for first place with personal cloud provider Tonido, during meetup #55 on the popular show This Week in Startups.","Internet Services, Travel and Tourism",,,1-10,2,Seed,1100000,USD,1100000,1100000,USD,1100000,"Rev1 Ventures, Ohio TechAngels Fund",,2,,Private,,,,,,
