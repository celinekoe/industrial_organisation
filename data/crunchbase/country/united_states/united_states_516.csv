The strategy of the company is to acquire an appropriate field with operations that provides current production and revenue. It should provide upside to the company with offset and infield drilling as well as efficient operational management thus reducing the risk of drilling and maximizing the production of the existing wells. The long-term strategy of the company is to deliver a publicly-traded company with long-term production and reserve growth by building a performance driven energy portfolio. The company’s strategy is achieved through a balance of oil and gas plays with downside hedges and upside price appreciation, vertical integration of services to positively impact bottom line revenue. Central to the plan of Wyutex is the acquisition and implementation of its investor strategy.  Exploration and development of energy resources is defined by risk.  Wyutex's strategy is simple and well defined in order to limit the risk involved.  First, provide investors in the company with security of their investment while providing a return.  Second, operate the field efficiently to maximize profits.  Third, establish a network of broker dealer relationships to offer participation in the company's drilling program.  Fourth, allow, at the option of the investor, the opportunity to convert their debt position in the acquired field into a position of equity based on the valuation of the operating company's financials. By implementing this plan, Wyutex will be given the opportunity to operate and development the company's resources while the investors will have a secure investment with positive returns and have the opportunity to participate in the significant equity upside of a pre-publically traded upstream oil and gas company.","Energy, Natural Resources",,,1-10,1,,,,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Retailers of unique items (antique dealers, thrift stores, etc.) struggle to scale online because populating, hosting and promoting an online store is time and resource intensive. While retailers know that online marketing is vital to increase customer reach, traffic & sales, they struggle to justify the time & money it takes to establish an online presence. InvenQuery is the answer.   InvenQuery’s web + mobile applications unite dispersed sellers of unique goods to populate a single online marketplace. Retailers that join an IQ marketplace benefit from inclusion in a well-designed, high traffic website, an easy mobile app for uploading their items, and social media sharing tools that showcase products where their customers actively search and share.  Through a niche marketplace, multiple retailers can join forces to attract their ideal customers. With our simple mobile app they showcase items on a marketplace, their own site, & their social media networks in seconds. By leveraging social media, IQ helps retailers amplify traditional marketing by driving shoppers to the marketplace. By aggregating sellers of similar items into one online marketplace, IQ creates a go-to resource for an industry. IQ is making economic, environmental and social impact serving the first of several vertical markets: the discount home improvement retail industry (e.g. reuse centers). Reuse centers take donations of reclaimed building materials and sell them to fund a variety of social and environmental initiatives, such as Habitat for Humanity’s home building efforts or Reclaim Detroit’s deconstruction job training program.  Currently, the $270 million material reuse industry is growing 15% per year, selling less than 5% of all inventories online. Yet 78% of home improvement projects start with an online search. IQ enables reuse centers to market their products where customers are shopping. With the IQ mobile application sellers can display inventories on an IQ marketplace website, their store’s website, and on popular social media sites, in a single workflow. IQ makes it easy for reuse centers to reach more customers with unique inventories, to solicit more donations, and ultimately, to provide valuable social and environmental conservation services to communities across the country. As reused material transactions increase, the IQ platform is poised to integrate with inventory and sales tracking technologies, enabling the capture of valuable transaction and landfill diversion data.","Commerce and Shopping, Sales and Marketing, Software",1,Nathan Benjamin,1-10,1,Early Stage Venture,650000,USD,650000,650000,USD,650000,Dundee Venture Capital,1,1,,Private,,,,,,

Chosen by D Magazine as one of the Best Lawyers in Dallas, Tim’s mission on every case is always to get the insurance company of the defendant to pay top dollar for his client’s case, which allows his clients to put the maximum amount of money into their pocket. In addition to being licensed as an Attorney at Law by the Supreme Court of Texas, Tim is a member of the Texas Trial Lawyers Association and the American Association for Justice, both of which advocate and advance the rights of injured victims against insurance companies. “When you see the type of abuse insurance companies deal out to people by refusing to pay legitimate claims and when you see them offer pennies on the dollar, it gives me a lot of satisfaction to make sure our clients are paid fairly. In many cases we can get insurance companies to pay 10 to 50 times the amount of their original offers,” Tim states. As a young man, Tim learned the value of hard work by working long hours for his father’s construction company. This lesson helps him every day as he engages in the hard work it takes to properly develop a case.","Professional Services, Real Estate",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

As Virginia natives, they were attracted to Richmond for its housing market, its deep rooted family values, and the tight community that makes the River City so special. They moved to Richmond in 2012 and by early 2013, RVA Property Solutions was established. While one investment property remains in Northern Virginia, their current portfolio is concentrated where their family resides in Chesterfield and surrounding counties. Initially, Rich started out doing what all the other real estate investors were doing—going around making cash offers to buy houses. He quickly noticed, however, that there were many problems with this typical approach: Some so-called real estate investors are nothing more than scam artists trying to separate home owners from their money. Sometimes it can be difficult to tell the difference between them and legitimate investors. Even legitimate investors often were either not making fair offers, or not being respectful of the home owners they were interested in purchasing property from. Investors were not doing anything to assist property owners with other problems they faced related to the sale of their home. There was little giving back to the communities those homeowners lived in. With this in mind, Rich decided that his company would take a transparent, education-based approach to real estate investing. Unlike most other investors, he purchases homes for cash quickly and at a fair price in a way that respects both the property owner and their community, and teach others how to do the same.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
