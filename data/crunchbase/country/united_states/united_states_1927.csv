As Miao explains, most kids games dress up education into gaming, which he compares to “covering broccoli with chocolate.” He thinks that having a more thoughtful approach to design of kids’ games is essential for self-motivated learning because it immediately engages kids and then gives them just enough of an information gap where the actual curiosity element kicks in. And it’s this curiosity that helps kids actually learn while playing a hame. The startup’s first title Dinorama, which is aimed at kids ages 7 through 12, is based around encouraging children to build a dinosaur theme park. The actual gaming and creative element centralizes around how to make the park successful from a financial standpoint. In Dinorama, kids learn about earning, spending, and saving money by building amusements for their visitors, caring for their dinosaurs, and weathering events like rainstorms that increase maintenance costs and lower ticket sales.","Apps, Community and Lifestyle, Education, Gaming, Software",1,James Miao,1-10,1,,1500000,USD,1500000,1500000,USD,1500000,Greylock,1,1,,Private,,,,,,
