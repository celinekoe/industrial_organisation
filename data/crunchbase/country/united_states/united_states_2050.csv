At 360imaging our mission is improve the cost, quality and accessibility of implant treatment planning worldwide through our unique solution offering that covers the whole cycle from scan to surgical guide. In close cooperation with top doctors and researchers around the world, 360imaging continues to develop the 360imaging solution, a complete solution for all implant treatment needs. The 360imaging solution draws upon our years of experience, expertise and innovation in the field making it the most perfect and complete solution for doctor needs.  360imaging solution includes the following set of integrated products and services:  - 360dps: An intuitive and easy to use treatment planning software for accurate and predictable planning of implant cases.  - Surgical Guides: The most affordable surgical guides for every case scenario.

Company History: 360imaging opened its doors for business in 2005, with the initial goal of building 3D CT imaging centers for the dental community across the United States. After opening two centers in Atlanta and one Preferred Scan Center in Athens, GA and one in Charlotte, NC, we realized the need to offer our dental practice clients Digital Lab service after each patient scan. In order to best serve our dental practice clients, we decided to pursue the development of the 360 Digital Lab, that offered complete Implant treatment related services including Radiology Reports, Conversion and Image Modeling and Treatment Planning services. After planning over 30,000 cases over 6 years, we saw the shortcomings of the software packages on the market and saw an opportunity to simplify the planning process through a superior software option that would work with any type of implant. That led to the development of 360dps; a comprehensive, cost-effective and intuitive implant planning software designed to make implant planning painless.  In addition, the backups and delays on surgical guides coming from overseas were a constant problem. In response, we have developed a state-of-the-art technology to produce surgical guides here in Atlanta, GA. This technology allows us to produce guides in half the time of guides that are produced overseas, letting practitioners complete cases faster and increasie cash flow.","Biotechnology, Hardware, Health Care, Science and Engineering, Software",1,Yahia Megahed,11-50,2,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

In 1994, a 16 year old high school computer whiz kid found himself frustrated with busy signals, sluggish speed while using the Internet and lack of local dial-up access. With the help of his older brother, they decided to build a better service, one that was faster and more reliable. The two brothers were Michael and Marcus Ruscitto and their idea became the budding enterprise known as Stargate.  In 1995 Stargate signed-up its first residential customer and later that same year moved out of Mike's bedroom and into their first offices in Belle Vernon. Three years later Stargate began their explosive growth by acquiring their largest competitor, USA Onramp. Today, Stargate is one of the nation's largest regional Internet companies, providing service primarily in Western Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and neighboring portions of Ohio, Virginia and Maryland, and boasting a customer count approaching 100,000.","Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Internet Services, Software",,,251-500,1,,5000000,USD,5000000,5000000,USD,5000000,Alta Communications,1,1,,Private,,,,,,
