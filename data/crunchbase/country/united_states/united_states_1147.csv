It was discovered that a wet phone could be saved if moisture was removed before a short or corrosion occurred. The key was developing a safe and effective way to rapidly remove all moisture. The first DryBox Rescue was introduced in San Antonio, Texas in 2011. In the first few months it dried hundreds of phones with an over 50% success rate. (Success rates were much higher when phones were dried within 24 hours of getting wet.) Charging $20 and total of $40 if a phone was successfully revived, customers saw value in using the 30 minute drying service before paying hundreds of dollars on a replacement. The proprietary technology has since dried thousands of wet phones and Dry Ventures, Inc. now produces two models for distribution.  The desktop model is designed for retail locations where a store employee performs the drying service for customers, while the self-service kiosk is a stand-alone model designed for shopping malls and grocery stores. DryBox Rescue provides a quick and cost-effective resolution for a wet phone.  With the rapid expansion of locations in the near future, DryBox will soon be known for saving the growing number of wet phones.",Mobile,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

How Does it Work? As currently designed in the technical drawings and 3-D models, the app has unique features not presently available in the marketplace.  Although the programming has not yet been developed and is still in the developmental stages, an explanation of possible operation is as follows: The primary function of Eye Phone is to help the user better see, read, and type on their phone or tablet. The user will be able to adjust the phone or tablet screen to their eyesight. Since the user will not always be the same distance from their phone or tablet, the user can have several different focus settings saved to the app. This will allow the user to quickly and easily adjust the screen for their eyes. The user will have the option to focus the screen three different ways, by prescription strength, an eye chart or manually adjusting the screen. What Problem(s) Does it Solve? The unique features of this app will provide the following benefits for all consumers: • Allows the user to adjust the phone or tablet screen to their eyesight • Saves the user time and energy by not having to squint to read their phone or tablet • Gives the user 3 different options to adjust the screen Mr. O’ Connor envisions his product appealing to multitudes of consumers worldwide who use     their “smart phones” not only for communication but also for innovative solutions. The markets are extensive for an ingenious app like Eye Phone; Google Play and iTunes are the most popular app stores in the primary market and are the ideal places to market this app. However, for the Android version of the app there are several new stores popping all over the cyber world such as, AppsLib, Samsung Apps, F-Droid, Slide ME, GetJar, and Amazon App Store for Android. Mr. O’ Connor wishes to leave the market open for subsequent variances and possibilities that could improve the feasibility and marketability of his product.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment, Software, Video",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
