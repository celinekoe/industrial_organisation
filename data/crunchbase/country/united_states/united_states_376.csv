Description: Ideally, the design them you choose for your bathroom remodeling Long Island will reflect your personality and your own unique preferences. Whether you are remodeling yourself, or hiring a professional, using a design theme will make your new bathroom a space you love. If you have a small bathroom space, but renovation is not in your plans or budget, there are things you can do to make it seem bigger. Bright, white colors are a great way to create an open feeling – on the walls and the floor. Installing the largest mirror your wall can accommodate can also help. The ocean and the beach are very popular themes for bathrooms. Shades of blue and green imitate the colors of the sea, while tiles and accents that feature fish, or pictures of the beach, can complete the ocean vibe. You can’t bring the beach home, but why not try a small display with sand and sea shells placed on a shelf? You can also imitate the colors of sand and driftwood by using light shades of brown for your countertops and cabinets. As appliances and other items in your kitchen get older, they become less safe. This applies to the electrical work in the kitchen, the flooring, and much more. If you complete a full kitchen remodel, your kitchen will be updated to comply with all the latest safety standards, so you can rest comfortably that your home is safe.  Of course, every person is going to have their own list of reasons why a kitchen remodel makes sense. If you’re thinking about updating your kitchen, reach out to us and get a free, no-obligation quote to see if it is something you would like to move forward with. Bathroom and Kitchen Remodel combines the extensive inventory and high-quality staff of the industry’s leading design outlets with the personalized service of a boutique Long Island shop.","Commerce and Shopping, Community and Lifestyle, Design, Real Estate",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The purpose for doing this is to make Bitcoin mining decentralized again. Satoshi Nakamoto’s idealistic vision of “one CPU one vote” has been superseded by a reality dominated by a very small number of entities, some of whom have engaged in abusive practices against individual miners and the Bitcoin network as a whole. Bitcoin Gold provides an opportunity for countless new people around the world to participate in the mining process with widely-available consumer hardware that is manufactured and distributed by reputable mainstream corporations. A more decentralized, democratic mining infrastructure is more resilient and more in line with Satoshi’s original vision. They want Bitcoin to be a shared and independent currency. They don’t want any fat cat to drive Their monetary architecture. That’s why Bitcoin Gold was born, in order to bring Bitcoin mining back to the “people”.    The Bitcoin Gold organization works to support the Bitcoin Gold cryptocurrency in particular, and the cryptocurrency space in general. Current and future operations are funded by a crypto Endowment held in multi-sig time-locked wallets.  Bitcoin Gold, BTG, is a cryptocurrency that began in 2017 as a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain.  Because Bitcoin Gold began as a fork, it contains the full transaction history of the Bitcoin blockchain up until the fork date, including the exact balances of Bitcoins held in wallets around the world. Any wallet address holding a Bitcoin balance immediately before the the fork held an equivalent balance of Bitcoin Gold immediately after the fork.  The original Bitcoin blockchain and the new Bitcoin Gold blockchain both continue onward independently after the fork, unaffected and unimpeded by each other.  As a result of this process, a new cryptocurrency was born.","Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Community and Lifestyle, Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Natural Resources, Other, Payments, Software",5,"Franco Niebles, Hang Yin, Jack Liao, Martin Kuvandzhiev, Robert Kuhne",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
