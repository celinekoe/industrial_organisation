We offer top-quality legal work without the bureaucracy and higher costs of larger law firms. All our attorneys have worked at large law firms in Arizona. Now, in a smaller environment, we offer a more personal and responsive approach for each of our client’s needs. Areas Of Practice - Business And Corporate Law - Employment Law - Litigation/Appellate Practice - Franchising Law - Collections Lawyers - Real Estate Matters At Denton Peterson our first priority is your success. We help with contracts. You may need different types of contracts in your business. As an employer, you will want to know your options related to non-compete agreements, and many businesses will also need a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to use when revealing confidential company information or entering into sensitive negotiations. Of course, employers also need employment agreements (or independent contractor agreements) to be legally sound—after determining whether an employment or independent contractor relationship is appropriate. We also assist with joint venture agreements, operating agreements, consulting agreements, sales agreements, sales contracts and other structural agreements needed for a concern to operate soundly. We help create corporations and LLCs. Our clients often come to us for the creation of their corporate or legal entities, whether an LLC, corporation, or other legal entity such as a partnership. As these documents are negotiated and drawn up, we can advise clients on the most advantageous legal structure for their operation. We help with litigation and trials. We are experienced and highly successful litigators. We have handled all kinds of business litigation matters, including commercial litigation, breach of contract disputes (including partnership disputes, employment disputes and payment disputes), infringement of intellectual property litigation (such as copyright and trademark lawsuits) and many other types of business litigation. We help with business transfers and buy/sells. If you sell your company or purchase one, we assist with buy/sell agreements; we are lawyers for merger and acquisition contracts; we transfer ownership of intellectual property; and we guide clients through the legal procedure for employment challenges inherent in transfer of ownership or merger of companies. We help with franchise law. We are experienced franchise law attorneys in Arizona, having represented many clients with putting together and reviewing franchise disclosure documents. We also assist with the purchase and sale of franchises. Whether you are looking to acquire legal counsel for your franchise in Arizona, or want to franchise your business, Denton Peterson has the legal expertise you need to successfully operate in the complex realm of franchise law. We help with business law matters. We handle many types of business law challenges that come up, including disputes between shareholders in a company, arguments between members in an LLC, partnership disputes and litigation, and handling the legal aspects of breaking up a business when necessary. This area includes agreements regarding the sale or purchase of stocks or shares, partner buyouts, asset purchase contracts, and so forth. We want to help you. Should you need assistance with these or other business legal issues, contact Denton Peterson today to schedule your consultation.
