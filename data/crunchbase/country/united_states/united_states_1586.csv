The company was founded to help customers better maintain and operate the things they love by improving task management and coordination between product owners and service professionals. Our solutions use mobile technology to simplify life for consumers, and help businesses engage customers more effectively. By automating communication and task coordination, MyTaskit increases customer loyalty, improves efficiency and boosts revenue potential for service providers; for customers, it streamlines communication, reduces hassles and improves customer care. MyTaskit started out as a solution for the boating industry, bridging the coordination and information gap between boat owners, service professionals, boat builders and equipment manufacturers. The company’s first product, The Boat Village, was designed to transform the way consumers and businesses communicate and transact business. Launched in October 2012, The Boat Village was conceived as an all-in-one front-office platform for communication, task management and service coordination. In October 2013, the company acquired DockMaster®, the top back-office solution for marine retailers, marinas and service centers. The integration of the two products created the most comprehensive end-to-end software solution for service providers – creating an easy-to-use, affordable solution that can drive operational efficiencies, increase customer loyalty, and vastly enhance customer service. In 2015, the company rebranded the combined solution – The Boat Village plus DockMaster® – into MyTaskit Pro. MyTaskit Pro has evolved into a solution that is ideal for any local service business – such as boat yards, RV repair centers, home repair specialists, contractors and auto mechanics – to manage customer service as well as back-office functionality such as processing work orders, ordering parts, accounting, billing and more. MyTaskit for consumers has become a solution that extends beyond coordination with local service providers.

With increased Internet usage and social sharing, families find themselves struggling with the age-old issues of privacy, security, and reputation—only these are now digital concerns that are potentially more prevalent and dangerous. Whether it’s a parent concerned about the photos their teen is sharing online; a corporate climber worried about his brother-in-law’s social rants adversely affecting his reputation; or an elderly couple concerned about having their online identities “spoofed”; new privacy, safety, and reputation solutions are sorely needed to help all members of the digital family. uKnow is tackling this opportunity by creating the world’s first digital family protection platform that powers solutions in two high-growth categories, Parental Intelligence and Social Identity Protection. The platform, branded uKnowConnect, powers the company’s two direct to consumer offerings, uKnowKids (Parental Intelligence) and uKnowID (Social Identity Protection) and it enables web-based and mobile applications for leading Identity Theft, Desktop Security, Cable & Telecom and other service providers. uKnowKids enables parents to keep pace with their children’s digital lives and to learn from expert digital parenting advice and information. In August the company will be releasing uKnowID (think of it as “Lifelock for your social identity”) to increase the awareness of, and reduce the damage from, social account takeovers, reputational risk from your network, and predatory identity spoofing.

Est. Pre-Money Valuation:	$5,000,000 Previous capital raised:  $2,100,000 Amount of capital seeking:  $1,500,000 Monthly burn rate:	$50,000	Current year revenue:	$200,000 Number of employees:	5 - 10	Date company was founded:	March 2012 Dented Brick Distillery is an award winning, fully operational, and high capacity distilled spirits plant producing old world craft spirits. Dented Brick has utilized web based sales programming and big data analytics to achieve strategic wholesale partnerships and distribution in 11 states offering 7 products. Our go to market strategy is based on the concept of brand activation at the on-premise point of sale. We have developed a web based portal to deliver utilitarian brand items to accounts. Our sales team is offered monthly sales programs to incentivise them to sell our brand, and the portal allows the sales member to deliver branded items to an account during a sales call as an incentive to the account to purchase our items. On-premise brand activation lead to off-premise sales. Federal law requires suppliers of alcohol contract distributors to sell their product to retailers. This is an impediment to customers wanting Craft brands. Due to mass consolidation of distribution, craft suppliers have few options of distributors to choose from. Small brands with distribution use sale forces that sell the equivalent mega brand. Small brands do not have the budget to activate consumers in the traditional mega brand campaign. The market share of U.S. Craft spirits reached 3.0% in value in 2015, up from 1.1% in 2010. This places 97% of the market in the hands of very large corporations like Beam Suntory. These mega brand competitors utilize massive budgets and national agency advertising and events. In addition, craft suppliers have few options of distributors to choose from. Our proprietary web portal and on-premise brand activation strategy allows us to end run this barrier, and go direct to the millennial consumer. Distributors are receptive to marketing offered by all suppliers. DBD is developing a web based platform to assist distributors with brand activation at on-premise locations through direct delivery of point of sale branding merchandise, a low-cost method to compete with the more expensive traditional branding campaigns used by mega brands. This method will offer a sales channel to the craft buyer and eventual crossover to off premise sales. Utilizing our proprietary data compilation tool, DBD can identify trends in the market on a monthly basis. We will be able to target trends at a state by state or national level in categories and brands to steer our product development and marketing. Our proprietary DentedBrick.com web portal allows distribution sales personnel to design custom point of sale merchandise on-line on-site, directly activating consumers at the point of sale. DBD is a national wholesale distribution company, and has contracted with Aurora Wine and Spirits, a national wholesaler with contacts and knowledge needed to assist DBD gain distribution in all targeted markets. The DBD on-premise support program will drive customer retention. The company value will increase exponentially with repeat customers in a multi-state distribution environment. The U.S. distilled spirits market in 2017 equated to $78.07 bn in sales, with the largest sub-category of spirits is vodka at 34%, then whiskey at 24%, and rum at 12%. The spirits industry has experienced steady growth over the last ten years. The spirits segment volume has been growing at a CAGR of 2% over the last 10 years. Smaller brands have been gaining share. The non-top 5 brands gained between 12 and 37 % over a 20 year period and between 2 and 9% in the last 5 years. Craft products like Tito’s Vodka and Hendrick’s Gin have become attractive brands. Millennials are driving the shift to Craft, using their purchasing power to disrupt the market. Surveys show Millennials drink more different types of spirits (vodka, rum, tequila and whiskey) than other generations. Often, as is the case with gin, new infusions that may have been impossible to market in the past are quickly becoming millennial mainstays. Marc Christensen, Founder, is a regulated markets wholesale distribution specialist and a proven entrepreneur as illustrated with the ongoing success of OTW Safety and US Wine. Mike McSorley, Head Distiller, has more than 20 years industry experience and has been a distiller with 2 prior operations. Karina Soriano has had industry experience as the Marketing lead for National Chain Even Steven Sandwiches. Channalyn Tek was formally the front of the house manager at the Grand America Hotel.
