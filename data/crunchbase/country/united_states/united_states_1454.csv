In 1910, the company invented a new electrically operated control device known as the solenoid valve. ASCO's heritage of innovation resulted in an extensive line of products that ranged from two position on/off valves to entire flow control systems designed to provide thousands of customer-specific solutions. Additional products were introduced during the 1970s, such as air-operated valves, manual reset valves, and pressure and temperature switches to satisfy the ever increasing demand of new customer applications. ASCO again expanded its product line in 1982 with the acquisition of Angar Scientific, a manufacturer of micro-miniature solenoid valves. In 1985, ASCO was acquired by Emerson, one of the world's largest and most respected industrial corporations. Later in the decade, Emerson purchased Joucomatic, Europe's leading pneumatic valve provider, and added it to the ASCO family. In 2008, Emerson merged the North American operations of its ASCO and Numatics companies to form ASCO Numatics, a unified business that offered comprehensive flow control and pneumatics solutions for a wide range of industry-focused applications.  Numatics is a leading manufacturer of pneumatics and motion control products. Founded in 1945, the company has an extensive history of generating innovative concepts and technological breakthroughs. With the introduction of the billion-cycle, lapped spool and sleeve valve in 1952, Numatics established its reputation for design excellence. New industry benchmarks for value, reliability, and performance were achieved again with the development of the 2005 Series and 2012 Series valves with advanced integrated fieldbus electronics. In 2016, ASCO and Numatics global operations were unified under the ASCO brand, setting the stage for the company's next period of growth.",Manufacturing,,,501-1000,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Deliverable,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/deliverable-6c3f,"Apps, Delivery Service, Information Technology, Software","New York, New York, United States",Uber + Shipping = Deliverable,"203,108","Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",Less than $1M,Closed,2020-06-02,day,,,,none,For Profit,http://www.deliverableapp.com,"Company Overview: The Deliverable team has been working tirelessly to produce a mobile application for my app. Between the drivers and the mobile application engineers, we have developed a whole new niche market of “same day” delivery. In the aftermath of a pandemic, my team is dedicated to providing our consumers with the best delivery options feasible. For the first time in history, we are inventing a revolutionary idea, which promotes same-day shipping. A consumer does not have to wait for two-to-three-days for delivery anymore. With Deliverable, the item will be driven to the consumer’s door within a 60 - 90 minute window.   Pain: Given our current circumstances, in our post-COVID-19 society, no one could have imagined that consumers are not going out to the brick and mortar stores any longer. According to a recent poll, more than seventy percent of consumers are conducting their shopping online, even for personal items. Due to society’s introversion, this planted the seed for the innovative application, Deliverable, in which one does not have to leave their home to obtain everyday items, such as groceries, household items, games, furniture, antiques, and miscellaneous item. Big box companies are already speaking with Deliverable to innovate the way we ship.    Solution: Instead of the onerous task of brick and mortar shopping, Deliverable provides a mobile application for consumers to receive items in the same business day or within ninety minutes, without ever having to leave their doorstep. With the click of a few buttons. Like any delivery service, the driver does not have to make contact with the person who receives the item, which limits the interaction to the Covid-19. The delivery driver acts like a post-man, and the item will be left at one’s doorstep without ever coming face-to-face. The entire transaction is completed through cyberspace. Technology: Currently, on Deliverable financial budget, Deliverable has produced an Apple (iPad and iPhone) version of the mobile application, and our next goal is to launch the Android version, but we need more funding in order to continue to make the application accessible for all consumers. In order to promote the application, we need marketing dollars. We would like to make Deliverable a household name. With marketing dollars, we can fund the press releases, commercials, radio broadcasts, referral, SEO, SMM, etc. IP/Defensibility: My intellectual property has a patent, and I have a lawyer on the payroll. My IP is protected by our patent, and Deliverable has a patent-lawyer on speed-dial, Hugh Keefe, Esq.   Competition/Competitive Advantage:  Target, Walmart, and Offerup, each company has already stolen parts of my intellectual patent for their business’s shipping options, and they are offering “same day shipping” on their mobile application. After speaking with my lawyer, Attorney Keefe, each company must cease and desist their “same day shipping” options. If these big-box giants, partner with Deliverable, we will be driving Walmart and Target products to customer’s doorstep. Additionally, on the app, we will stimulate the pricing of products in retail, because there is a follow social feature. When someone delivers something, the price and any info gets posted on a list. When the consumer sees that price they will possibly change their buying methods. Market Size/Customers: The goal for our market size in the United States—we launch the application nationwide. Per state, Deliverable is looking, to begin with, Connecticut and New York. Subsequently, we have five drivers and are currently in a race to get 200, independent contractors, ready on stand-by, in Connecticut as soon as the app launches on Friday. Once the analytic data from Connecticut and New York goes through our Firebase cloud, with your funding we will launch nationwide. Deliverable offers customers a free-delivery, one-time free coupon, upon their registration of the mobile application.  Free delivery is one way for the application to go viral (Uber did the same tactic.) The postal market is very lucrative. If we get one percent of the national postal market, according to pre-COVID-19 numbers in 2018, USPS, FedEx, and UPS deliver over 56 million packages per day which leads to 5,400,000 packages being handled through Deliverable per day. If each delivery transaction is 20$, the daily numbers would be in the millions $108,000,000.  Business Model: The Deliverable business model is very simple: provide an excellent same-day delivery service to everyday consumers, and our goal is to transport as many items as we can per day to the appropriate destination. Also, we need to partner with as many companies as we can, so they can include us as an option at their mobile checkout. Once we are funded, we can open analytic data-centers (one in every two states) to analyze the information to make sure we do not have any downtime. Driver to Consumer collaboration will be made with the separate application that is currently underway. Milestones: As a team, we are launching a mobile application this week. Our first milestone is we found an innovative team of engineers in India, to maintain our budget, who is currently working on finalizing the mobile application.  We fulfilled our quota for drivers in New York and Connecticut. Financial: Deliverable gets paid on a daily basis, and projections are high. As soon as the application launches, I will make sure each driver is compensated for each completed delivery. The driver gets 60% and the company gets 40%. For example, if the delivery is 20$. The driver gets 12$ and we get $8. As soon as the driver completes the delivery, the driver gets paid immediately through the mobile application. Per each state, there will be charging sales tax. There is a standard insurance clause the consumer agrees to when they register for the application. This is how our financial work = $2.99 a mile for a small to mid-size vehicle. $3.49 a mile for a larger car or SUV. Finally, it’s $3.99 to $4.49 depending on whether a truck, flatbed, or freight has to be used.","Apps, Information Technology, Software, Transportation",1,William Indocci,11-50,1,Seed,1000,USD,1000,1000,USD,1000,,,,,Private,,,,,,
