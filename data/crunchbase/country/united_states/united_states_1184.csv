Its intensive curriculum helps participants face tough choices with clarity and discover the sense of purpose they need to realize true success — however they define it for themselves.   Autonomy and Life has two verticals: two-day Advanced Classes and three-day Retreat Workshops. Siegel personally directs each Advanced Class and Retreat Workshop, sharing with participants the latest refinements to his thought system.    Retreat Workshops “[introduce] the paradigm shift that will be the foundation of [participants’] newfound emotional freedom, personal creativity and self-expression,” per Autonomy and Life’s website. They’re held every six months at a rotating slate of upscale hotels and destination resorts on the East and West Coasts.    Attendance is typically capped at 100, giving Arnold Siegel plenty of opportunities to interact with participants. Siegel, a prolific writer, makes his Autonomy and Life books available exclusively to Retreat Workshop attendees during each session.   Designed for returning students who’ve already participated in one or more Retreat Workshops, Advanced Classes build on Autonomy and Life’s foundation to deliver a “realistic understanding of why we continue to think and feel the way that we do.” There are 12 classes each year: six in the New York City area and six in the Los Angeles area. Veteran Autonomy and Life participants rave about their relevance. “The coursework has affected every facet of my life,” says one; “a new understanding of the meaning of life,” says another.   Autonomy and Life also has an active online content portal maintained by Siegel himself. In Siegel’s words, the blog is a “timeless and timely gateway to the vocabulary, perspective and discipline that will support you in creating a life of your own design.”","Community and Lifestyle, Education",1,Arnold Siegel,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The ubiquity of reliable, always-on Internet connections has made it possible for companies to move applications, data, and media from disk-based distribution to cloud-based services. Analyst firm William Blair and Co. predicts the cloud services market to reach $34 billion per year by 2012, but the growth of cloud applications and media is currently limited by the quality of experience of transferring data into and out of the cloud. Previous solution attempts do not adequately address the problems cloud service providers are facing. Content Delivery Networks focus only on downloading content and are highly application specific. WAN Optimization devices, built for point-to-point communication, require high capital expenditure and were not designed for the variability of the Internet and mobile networks. Peer-to-Peer networks are inherently insecure, underperforming, and cannot accommodate real-time interactive content. Asankya's solution optimizes transport speed bi-directionally in a way that supports encrypted communications and even streaming services for a significantly enhanced experience. Asankya has developed patent-pending technology that provides intelligent network characterization and scheduling capabilities to manage data flows. Asankya's Hypermesh service enables each packet of a data stream to be sent along a different network path, dynamically avoiding bottlenecks and congestion points that currently limit speed and quality, while still maintaining packet order. As more applications, data, and media services move to the cloud, Asankya's innovative capabilities enhance the performance of cloud-based services for a fast, secure, and globally consistent experience.","Internet Services, Software",3,"Raghupathy Sivakumar, Scott Ryan, Scott Ryan",11-50,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Our pages — occasionally unruly, seldom dull, and always edifying — feature conservatives like Robert Kagan and P. J. O’Rourke alongside liberals like George Packer and David Rieff, and others who transcend categories, such as Christopher Hitchens. This variety makes for some of the best conversation available anywhere in print and online. Building on this tradition, we launched WorldAffairsJournal.org in January 2010. Updated throughout the day, this site highlights news, opinion, and research from media, governments, and think tanks around the world. The site’s unique news offerings allow the reader, on any given day and with any given headline story, to see how the same news is reported differently in important media outlets around the globe. In addition to extensive news aggregation, WorldAffairsJournal.org features blogs by leading opinion makers and commentators from the US as well as Europe, the Middle East, and Russia — some of them dissident voices within their own political culture. World Affairs and WorldAffairsJournal.org are published by the World Affairs Institute, a newly formed nonpartisan 501(c)3 organization, located in Washington D.C., established to promote public education and awareness on international issues related to war and peace.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
