With tenacious spirits and the help of new, emerging tea brewing technology, Dan and John embarked on a mission to make and distribute the first-ever gourmet, fresh-brewed iced teas for restaurants. After mixing and tasting numerous different tea leaf combinations, they hit on the perfect combination for iced black tea. So they started blending and packaging it from Martinson's garage and distributing it themselves around the state. Three years later, Rommie Flammer, a plucky, local high-schooler joined the company and began moving up.
