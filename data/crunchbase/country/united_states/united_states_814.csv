This is it. In an industry whose stock valuations are exploding as you read this.     We are developing a process called Ionic Migration Leaching to recover metals from subterranean deposits using in-situ electrodes to collect, precipitate, and remove metal ions. This revolutionary process can be powered by solar, wind or natural gas fuel cell produced electricity. Our technology is benign to the environment causing minimal disturbance as only the desired metals are extracted and removed leaving original rock strata in place and untouched. In essence this technique reverses the natural processes that formed the deposits in the first place.    A deposit containing in excess of $500 million value of uranium has been identified and is being acquired. This deposit is within an area identified by a US government agency as containing an estimated 200 million pounds of uranium resources. These resources were thought to be too low grade to produce in the past. Ionic Migration Leaching would make them profitable to extract at current prices.     This investment should be viewed as high risk - high reward. If we are successful, early investors could receive a return of ten to one or more. If we are not successful, they could lose all of their investment. We desire only investors who understand this concept.","Government and Military, Natural Resources",,,1-10,1,,2000,USD,2000,2000,USD,2000,,,,,Private,,,,,,
