When Aedren was one, Alysia had a moment of realization – two overpriced electronic toys, that were advertised as being “smart”, were simultaneously calling for Aedren’s attention in the loudest, most repetitive manner possible. Yet, Aedren was content playing with her wooden blocks a few feet away. Based on her experiences at Carnegie Mellon University, Alysia knew there were more inventive ways to use technology. She started noticing that many tech toys weren’t built with children’s development in mind – they simply aimed to distract children, not entertain or enrich them. That night, Alysia couldn’t sleep. Her mind was whirling with ideas for how to use technology to encourage children to play with more creative, hands-on activities. She took those ideas to her design professor and created an independent study to explore the possibilities. Niko worked with Alysia to expand her ideas and create visuals and prototypes. After getting an extremely positive reception from parents, kids, peers, and even investors, Alysia and Niko decided to continue their work as a formal company. Since their daughter was the inspiration, they named the company after her: AE Dreams. Shortly after joining Project Olympus, a CMU incubator, they pitched Turtle Mail to a Pittsburgh hardware accelerator. Through these resources they received seed funding and mentorship to flesh out their business and manufacturing plans. They built a team, recruiting from CMU’s talent, with backgrounds in design, engineering, child psychology, business, and marketing. Many team members are parents, and each member joined the project because they believed in the vision of using technology to make kids’ playtime more meaningful and magical. Turtle Mail is a wooden mailbox for kids that receives and prints digital content using an embedded thermal printer. Turtle Mail is WiFi-connected, so family and friends can send kids messages from a mobile or desktop device, and kids get their mail printed out each day from Turtle Mail. Parents can sign their children up for daily activities from AE Dreams, like word searches and drawing exercises. Parents can also help their kids connect to their imaginary worlds by subscribing to content from fictional characters and by building toy profiles for their kids’ favorite toys. Just set up your preferences and we’ll do the rest! Turtle Mail’s content adjusts based on children’s age and reading level, and children’s preferences can be modified at any time by their parents.","Consumer Goods, Education",2,"Albert Niko Triulzi, Alysia Finger",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

""To provide good, honest web hosting."" We were tired of the games and misdirection other hosting providers played with their customers. With that in mind, we swore we would always be upfront and honest with our customers and would never intentionally deceive or mislead them. We promised we would never offer something like 'unlimited' resources; because 'unlimited' isn't possible. Honesty became more than just our ideal, it became the core of our identity and name.  That is why we constantly strive to improve and change.  We want to be sure to provide better hosting, honestly. AnHonestHost was started in April 2014, providing basic web and dedicated server hosting.  As we grew, we learned new ways to provide better service. This lead to moving all dedicated servers to our Cloud, and introducing outbound spam filtering to protect our client's email reputation. In August 2016, we launched our new site, introducing new Business Shared Hosting plans and moving to all SSD based servers.  We look forward to what the future holds and hope that you will be with us on the journey. --AnHonestHost Team How We Are Different We are a company dedicated to being honest to our customers. We admit when we screw up, and we provide a report of what happened with  plans to help correct and prevent problems from happening in the future. We get excited about new technologies that we get to play with. Our customers have benefitted from our  from our desire to tinker,  explore and build.  We had an implementation of Apache 2.4, PHP7, PHP-FPM and Node.js well before they were supported in cPanel. We continue to test and implement new technology regularly. We understand what it is like to be a small business. We started as a crew of 3 people, trying to make a difference in the hosting industry.   At the start, we weren't sure if this was going to be a model that would work or resonate with people.  Thankfully over the years our customers have shown it was a good decision and we continue to grow. We understand that small businesses have a ton of things they have to juggle and keep track of, so we try to make sure our customers have the plans and tools they need to succeed, with minimal fuss. At the end of the day, we are people, just like you. We aren't another mega-giant hosting company.  We care for our clients and we try to provide the tier of support we would want for our clients.",Internet Services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
