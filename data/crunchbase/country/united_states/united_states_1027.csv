All of the systems that he had tried actually made bidding harder because they did not mesh with the way estimators really worked. They were rigid, unintuitive, and unrealistic, as if designed by programmers who had no real-world experience construction. His solution was simple and practical: Use the same terminology and methods used by real estimators.  Make bidding faster by utilizing reusable bid items and by allowing multiple users to work on a job at the same time.  Allow bid items to be broken down into multiple levels for exacting accuracy.  Make the interface simple and intuitive so that even those with very little computer experience can use the system. Although he designed it for his own use, he shared his system with friends and colleagues, who also found it superior to the systems they had been using.  As word spread, people started offering to buy the program and SharpeSoft was born. Fast forward 30 years and their systems remain the most comprehensive and user-friendly software solutions available for civil construction contracting and project management.","Real Estate, Software",1,Daniel Ontiveros Ramos,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Today we are still the only company in the world who has used AWP cost-effectively. The system was called COMSAIL and was used during the energy crisis in the early 1980s. Today we have improved our AWP system significantly. The new AWP system is called the COMSAIL Wing; it is fully automatic, provides real-time thrust analysis, has a lift coefficient six times greater and a utilization rate 20% greater. We already have a degree of interest from the shipping community so we are now looking to file two Utility Patents – one mechanical and the other for software. Provisional Patents have been filed but the Utility Patents must be completed by 1 September.  Ninety percent of everything moves my ship at some point. SFI will be looking to put AWP on tankers and gearless bulk carriers. The cost of fuel on these vessels is 70-80% of operating costs. The IMO and the USCG are pressuring ship  owners to reduce GHG emissions - ships are the sixth largest emitters of GHG in the world, behind China, Russia, India and Japan. Some ports are forcing ships to switch to shore-power while in port and lighter fuels while entering ports. There are very few options to reduce fuel consumption on ships. They include 1) traveling slower, 2) better hull coatings and 3) small adjustments to the main engine. In brief, the shipping industry needs to find a way to reduce fuel consumption and wind is one of the ways to do it; it is the only way to power a ship without increasing GHG emissions. Capt. Anderson, a principal of SFI, wrote his graduate thesis on how to equate hull roughness in terms of energy savings. This same technology will be used in one of the two utility patents being filed. The money will be used to cover the Patent filings and some of the overhead.","Energy, Other",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Metreos provided both packaged applications and a set of tools for designing, developing, deploying, and managing applications deployed on IP telephony networks. Their primary customer base were large enterprises who had invested significant capital in replacing aging [TDM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-division_multiplexing) based phone systems with new [Voice-over-IP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP) phone systems, specifically those who had chosen Cisco Systems as their VoIP vendor of choice. Large Cisco customers began to use the Metreos product suite in 2004 with early deployments by Lehman Brothers and BearingPoint. Frustrated by the lack of support from their primary IP PBX vendor, Metreos customers were able to use the Metreos Communications Environment to customize their IP telephony deployment to their liking, often times implementing features that were lost in the transition from TDM to IP. Recognizing that many of their large marque customers were using the Metreos product to enhance their Cisco deployment, Cisco purchased Metreos in June 2006 for $28 million USD.","Information Technology, Internet Services, Messaging and Telecommunications, Mobile, Platforms, Software",2,"Louis Marascio, Mark Richards",11-50,2,M&A,4355000,USD,4355000,4355000,USD,4355000,"Covera Ventures, Gefinor Capital, Startech Early Ventures",2,3,,Private,,,,,,
