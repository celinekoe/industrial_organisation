The Lead Broker is Jaime Brown, a former real estate agent with a strong background in decision and risk management. Her experience in both the corporate world and property market has made her essential in the lives of her clients.  This company has taken a personalized approach to every buyer and seller they work with. In the middle of a pandemic, it was this baseline that allowed Tampa Homestyles to quickly pivot in the face of new standards. By putting the clients' needs first, the company was able to promote new properties to buyers via virtual tours. The staff was also able to arrange for social distancing measures to ensure that relocating buyers could still see homes in person if they so chose. Jaime Brown founded the company because she noticed how her knowledge, experience, and skills could help buyers and sellers get more from every transaction. Too many deals in the industry are made without enough transparency. Buyers and sellers don't have the information they need to make better decisions for themselves, their families, and their portfolios. The website for Tampa Homestyles is packed with tips on how to increase home value, where to find a credible lender, and when it's time to close the deal. It's why people count on Tampa Homestyles Real Estate for advice on sales strategy, competitive market analysis, and risk assessment.  Jaime Brown understands the stakes of such high-value sales and works hard to achieve a fair outcome for all sides. In March, she served as the buyer's agent for a $6.4 million property on the waterfront. Her efficiency is built on metrics, and she approaches each decision with a healthy balance of caution and confidence.","Financial Services, Real Estate",1,Jamie Brown,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
