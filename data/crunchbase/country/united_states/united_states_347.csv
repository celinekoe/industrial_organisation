It helps brands, services, and purveyors of “considered” purchases reach potential customers–where they live. Quite literally. This audience has already visited the brand’s site, they’ve expressed interest in certain products and services, and they’re just one step away from becoming buyers. They just need another branding impression to remind them. The best part of all is that they shared their location with the brand’s website. And that’s precisely where we step in. We discover single family home addresses of otherwise-anonymous website visitors. We then print, address, stamp and send a postcard to their address on the same day. Automatically. It’s a little like magic, yes. Our customers don’t have to lift a finger, or lick a stamp. They won’t even know it happened until our notice arrives via email with the day’s numbers. Think of inboundgeo as personal delivery service for your targeted marketing message. This is marksman level targeting. And if that wasn’t enough, the postcard is hand delivered by a federal employee, directly to the door of your future buyers. How cool is that? There are just three things left to do: 1) Install the code. 2) Upload a postcard. 3) Fund your account. Step 3 means you set the budget up front. Spend as much as you’d like, and not a dollar more.
