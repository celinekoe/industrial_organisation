With literally decades of combined multi-platform experience, we are truly an unbiased total solutions provider. In 1998 we opened our current 63,000 square foot state-of-the-art integration facility, warehouse and corporate headquarters located in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Having well in excess of $1 billion combined technology sales we are one of the largest, most trusted and established resellers of new and refurbished computer equipment in the country.

We back every one of our orders with a manufacturerâ€™s maintenance eligibility guarantee and our exclusive 3 Year Warranty. We believe that manufacturers of IT equipment often discontinue products faster than their useful life expectancy. Businesses often find themselves with few alternatives when products they'd standardized on were suddenly no longer available.
