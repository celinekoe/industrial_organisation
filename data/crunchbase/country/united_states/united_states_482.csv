When Customer Relationship Management (CRM) started to transform the market, he led a global CRM implementation.  The project’s success impressed him. The aggregate systems, people and processes that enabled sales to execute — the sales platform — was growing new, powerful capabilities. However, additional tools would need to be brought into alignment with corporate strategy before they could be used competitively. Strategy and sales execution had always struggled to align, but the accelerating evolution of the sales platform would require constant dialogue between strategy and Sales; data from Sales would inform strategy, and strategic change would need faster strategy execution. Putting these systems and communications in place would require a rare combination of talents, which many companies would struggle to reproduce.   Steven created the solution that would elevate sales operations above its traditional support role into its necessary alignment with business strategy. Bringing together tech talent and leadership experience, he created a process for designing and executing positive change in sales operations.
