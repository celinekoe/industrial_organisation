These companies wanted to computerize more aspects of their business, including inventory control, and move to a bigger computer system capable of handling more on-line users. At the time, this was considered ""leading edge"", since there were very few ways to do this, short of purchasing a ""mainframe"" computer costing millions of dollars to buy, and many more hundreds of thousands of dollars to maintain each year.Their Smart Warehouse software has given their customers a 21st Century Showroom.
