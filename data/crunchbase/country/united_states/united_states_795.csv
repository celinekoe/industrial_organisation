Caffe Borsa believes that coffee should be enjoyed without boundaries: outside, inside, at work, on travel, with friends, or alone in peace. The magic of Caffe Borsa’s delivery system is brewing it yourself, whenever you wish, wherever you may be – with just hot water. In today’s fast paced technological world, why should we have to worry about whether we will have our favorite coffee to depend on? Caffe Borsa places an importance on conserving the planet’s natural resources and making the future a better place. We’ve developed a product that doesn’t require a machine and the product is made of 100% Arabica ground coffee and special filter paper only. Even the coffee is air-tight packed in single serving proportions, so no unused ground beans are wasted.  The management team at Caffe Borsa includes decades of combined experience in food and drink product development, sales, and marketing. Scott Choi comes from a background of international trade and marketing. Jim Song, once an engineer and now an entrepreneur, brings his technical expertise and financial management experience to the table. Paul Tuan and Eric Li also bring cash flow management and debt-financing expertise from working at the investment banks.  Their advisor Joe Di Stanislao, past president of the National Specialty Food Broker Association, demonstrates his understanding of the marketplace with his over 40 years of serving as a broker in the industry. Food service advisor, Bill Waldo, past president of Supreme Foodservice, Inc, has over 20 years of experience in food service sales and marketing to hotels, restaurants, and distributors. Based in Irvine, CA, Caffe Borsa works with coffee traders and tea farmers to deliver top-quality products from dedicated growers to end users who appreciate high quality and exquisite taste. Caffe Borsa has established strong relationships with distributors, freight forwarders, custom brokers, the Food and Drug Administration, and Customs and Border Protection.","Food and Beverage, Transportation, Travel and Tourism",1,Jim K Song,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
