In 2008, they created their first dynamic advertising campaign for NIKEiD and they saw the simplicity, power and profit that targeted, dynamic advertising promised for marketers in any industry. When they combined their dynamic ad creative and production with the ability to more precisely retarget and measure the performance of their clients' campaigns, they knew they had cracked the code that was stifling so many marketers. The Live Ads is the innovative outcome and the latest chapter in this story. It provides precise media targeting that can be easily measured and optimized, making it possible for brands to more easily communicate their message to consumers across all digital touchpoints - all within a product that is easy to use and powerful.

They efficiently supply best practices and supporting information at the point of care to improve care quality, ease compliance, lessen over AND underutilization, and increase workflow efficiency. They present interactive appropriate use criteria from leading medical societies and providers to ensure compliance and assist in providing the best, most consistent and safest care possible. Consider adding your own protocols to further refine best practices at your organization. In addition to eliminating inappropriate tests, they supply comparison cost data before orders are placed to guide clinicians to the most appropriate and most cost effective tests and procedures. They deliver detailed guidance and other critical information when you need it most to improve team workflow efficiency. Customizable features provide assistance with coding, precise payer pricing, minimize referral leakage and assist with payer pre-authorization and reimbursement. Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) in their native form are often lengthy and complex, and moreover, change periodically based on the latest research and technology. As such they are impossible to memorize… and why should you? Their tool provides fast, interactive access to AUC with the fewest possible clicks to all but eliminate the chance of inappropriate ordering. Their tool also documents AUC consultation to prove compliance, standardize care and reduce liability exposure because the best defense against mal-practice is best practice.   Cost comparison data is displayed (if desired) before orders are placed to guide clinicians to the best test or procedure, not just an appropriate one. Consider that the ACC’s criteria covering seven common tests used to identify ischemia produce an average of 3.3 tests that are appropriate for any given set of patient conditions. Moreover, 59% of the time these appropriate tests include a test in both the lowest and highest cost ranges (roughly $200 vs $3,000). Their chart studies prove that astronomical rates of return are possible from providers on cost sharing models making only modest improvements in lower cost ordering. Alternately, they know that many useful but expensive tests are not being ordered, when they may be the best appropriate choice. However, clinicians simply don’t have the tools to easily know when those scenarios arise because they are far too complex to memorize and require detailed knowledge of each patient’s history that is often times not present in the EHR.","Administrative Services, Health Care, Software",2,"Chip Brunk, Michael Staab",1-10,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,StartUp Health,,1,,Private,,,,,,
