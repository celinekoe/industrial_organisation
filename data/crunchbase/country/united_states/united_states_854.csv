This new science, invented by To Soil Less founder Richard Campbell, operates under the fundamental equation of water + river rock = plant food, referred to as the Campbell Equation.  With gravel gardening, the rules of gardening differ drastically compared to all known types of gardening and agricultural processes. The benefits of gravel gardening are: 1) No soil use; 2) No fertilizer use; 3) Low water needs; 4) Low cost to consumers; 5) Minimal weeding; 6) Fresh tasting food quality; 7)Durable and long lasting; 8) Sustainable both indoors and outdoors; 9) Scalable and 10) Helps address food security issues globally.  The are an estimated 9 sub industries of gravel gardening from decades of academic research with universities to  use in the design of green roofs and balconies to retailing gravel grow cups for the home window sills or in the classroom as an experiment for students K-12.  Gravel also can help feed the homeless and poor, providing a permanent source of several types of produce using very little water.  Overseas, gravel gardening can enable those in places with poor soil quality to enjoy the benefits of sustainable gardening, providing their families with year round access to produce at home.  To Soil Less partners include George Washington University who helps study the geological side of the science, while Tennessee State University's Department of Agriculture studies the agricultural effect of gravel gardening.  The Washington, DC area Ace Hardware is the primary retail partner as Ace  retails the best gravel tested to date by To Soil Less.  There are several media interviews in the market, from in-studio TV news interviews to blogger reviews to press releases that have been picked up in over 200 news outlets.","Agriculture and Farming, Food and Beverage",1,Richard Campbell,1-10,1,,60000,USD,60000,60000,USD,60000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Service companies should have a completed service model and revenues generated from at least one market segment.   The initial investment ranges from $100,000 to $250,000 per company.  They typically reserve additional capital for follow-on investments as needed.  Their investment would involve placing a director on the company board.  Depending on the needs of the company, this director could provide value-added input on product development, product positioning, regulatory affairs, or sales and marketing.   They are willing to lead an investment round and provide the diligence necessary to attract other larger venture investments.
