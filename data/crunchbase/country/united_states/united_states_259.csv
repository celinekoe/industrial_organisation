There are many segments of the U.S. talent acquisition market. The market is growing in many segments including staffing firms, which are expected to achieve $125 billion in revenue in 2015. One of the largest growing segments in the talent acquisition market are the recruitment software providers, which will grow to $3 billion in 2015 with growth rates of 14.3% over the past 5 years. Market experts estimate that the U.S. represents approximately one-third of the world market and that the Global Talent Acquisition Market exceeds $400 billion (Market Line).    Digi-Me believes that all players in the talent acquisition market – whether employers or their software and service providers – will benefit from the use of video for employment advertising and employer branding. Because Digi-Me’s target customers and service providers are global themselves, and because its cloud-based technology platform is global and completely scalable as well, management believes Digi-Me is capable of addressing the global talent acquisition market. Management estimates its video services potentially constitute 10% of the talent acquisition market, of which an estimated 10% is actually reachable by Digi-Me, resulting in a global, addressable market opportunity of $4 billion.    To provide perspective, the development of internet-based employment services enabled employers to eliminate 92% of newsprint classified ads from 2000 -2009, as classified ad spending dropped from $8.5 billion to $750 million. The Company expects rapid adoption of video capabilities to complement internet text postings because of dominant trends in consumer preferences driven by technology: high penetration of smart mobile devices, video streaming, social media, and the dramatic increase in video consumption among all demographics.","Administrative Services, Advertising, Information Technology, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Other, Professional Services, Sales and Marketing, Video",1,Roger Stanton,11-50,1,,200000,USD,200000,200000,USD,200000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Not long ago, Bill experienced a series of health issues that forced him to rely on his personal Medicare Supplement Insurance. With heart surgery, emergency appendicitis, open-heart surgery, and knee surgery all in a two year period, Bill quickly exceeded his Medicare coverage, with bills totaling well over $400,000. Click for a look at Bill’s medical bill. “It was unbelievable!” Bill laughs. “I have been so healthy for my whole life, but in that short period of time I was hit from every direction, and I would have had to pay almost half a million dollars in medical bills if I didn’t have Medicare and my Medicare Supplement Insurance plan. Instead, I paid nearly nothing. More than ever before, I see the value we provide to our customers at SeniorQuote.” In the early 1970s, Bill worked with the Waddell and Reed life insurance model which promoted low-cost term life insurance in place of higher cost whole life insurance with the proposition that the difference in premium (premium savings) should be invested in mutual funds for retirement. In the 1980s, Bill was a founder of SelectQuote Insurance Services, one of the first life insurance agencies to offer a term life insurance quote comparison service. The SelectQuote service was designed to assist people by providing affordable rates available from highly-rated life insurance companies. In the 1990s, Bill was a founder of First Union Insurance Services, which offered affordable term life and permanent insurance to support the needs of the bank’s many customers.  For the past ten years, Bill has keenly focused on the needs of Baby Boomers; helping them to replace their term life insurance with affordable permanent life insurance, and helping them sort through their Medicare and Medicare Supplement options as they approach the mandatory Medicare age of 65. A senior himself, Bill has become an advocate for seniors. Through SeniorQuote, Bill leads his experienced team of insurance professionals to search for healthcare coverage that fits the specific needs of his customers.",Financial Services,1,WILLIAM H.

Chip and I run a few businesses here in Waco, Texas, but Magnolia Market holds a special place in my heart. This entire business idea was born completely out of a dream I didn’t know could ever come to life. It’s truly only because a fiercely faithful, brave and bold husband pushed me to pursue my dream that it ever came to be. In 2003, we bought our “Little Shop on Bosque” and opened the first Magnolia Market. In that store, I developed and sharpened my design style and skills, grew as a business owner, and gained much needed confidence in Magnolia Market and myself. After Chip and I had our first two kiddos, we made the tough decision to close the Market and focus on growing and raising our family. During this time, we really honed in on Magnolia Homes, our construction business, for many years. This is where we were able to learn the construction side of things, and we loved the idea that we were “making Waco beautiful one home at a time.” This work was meaningful to us, and we worked together for many years as a team; Chip in construction, and myself in the design. Soon HGTV’s Fixer Upper came along. But something began tugging at my heart, and I began feeling a pull toward reopening Magnolia Market. So in May of 2014, we pulled the trigger, and the Little Shop on Bosque reopened for business. Fast forward a couple of years, and here we are! To think that my business plans scribbled on scratch paper have turned into this online store is unbelievable to say the least. Not to mention the fact that we’ve recently outgrown our Little Shop on Bosque, and moved into our new Magnolia Silos location in downtown Waco! What an amazing season this has been! Thank you for taking the time out of your day to visit Magnolia Market. We love hosting you, and hope you might even come on out to Waco for a visit soon!

Tumor cells are removed from a patient, the cells are cultured in the laboratory and infected with live vaccinia virus—the active component of the vaccine that eradicated smallpox. During incubation, viral oncolysis occurs, in which the virus enters the tumor cells and breaks them open, spilling their contents, in a process known as lysis.
