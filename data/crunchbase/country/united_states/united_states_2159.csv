When staff view draft as the easiest thing to give away, theft through commission or laziness becomes common. So we started building products that could monitor draft beer flow in real-time, in an age when “cloud” capabilities had not yet changed computing. After understanding what was going through the draft beer lines, the next step was to pair sales information to the real-life activities of the draft taps — an accounting system that allowed management to observe operations at a micro- or macro-level. Since then, we’ve come a long way – we’ve developed over 150 custom-built Point-of-Sale integrations; we’ve added clients on all 6 continents; we’ve installed at rock joints and wine bars and Irish pubs and hockey stadiums. We’ve learned from our mistakes to build a product we can be proud of – and we’ve tracked over 7 billion pints of beer.","Food and Beverage, Other, Sales and Marketing, Travel and Tourism",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
