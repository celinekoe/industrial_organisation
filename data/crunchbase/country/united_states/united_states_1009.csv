These indicators came from a number of different sources including; hiring trends, recent funding, executive hires, and more. As we started to look into this data and began to understand the growth trends associated, we thought we could take it one step further. Growjo is intended to identify growing companies sure, but what we found out when devising our algorithm was that Growjo could actually identify companies that were poised for ongoing and future growth as well. Our algorithm isn’t about just a few indicators like revenue or total employees, it’s about finding trends in multiple data points, predicting growth and presenting that data in a useful and consumable way. There are other B2B lists out there, inc 5000 and forbes 500 come to mind, and companies can certainly apply for these types of recognition lists, but Growjo is different. No submissions required, and we don’t include companies that are over 1000 employees already. (The recognition of companies that are on their way up toward over 1000 employees seemed more appealing then highlighting the Microsoft’s and Exxon Mobil’s of the world.) We also offer a downloadable .csv file of the companies free of charge, and we recognize each company with unique badges they can utilize on their website, scripted social sharing options and PR templates so it is extremely easy to promote your rank.

And certainly not 10, 15, 25 or more. At some point, these businesses need a system, something to stay organized, something to grow with so they don't lose control of themselves along the way. Order, shipments, purchase orders, inventory and financials need a single point of truth and a home. Most companies cobble together separate tools as they grow, but the weight of disorganization and lack of order collapses and eventually catches up to them. Sales does not know if something is shipped, purchasing doesn't know if a PO was received, accounting doesn't know if the items on an invoice was received and creates exponentially more meetings without the necessary structure and context to make it useful. This is where humans act as duct-tape and where Fulfil comes in.

With today’s toxic media hurting us all, our company purpose is to harness the power of storytelling to help heal, not harm.  We serve a values-aligned economy where consumers increasingly back brands that share their values. With so many of us suffering from the adverse effects of negative media (anxiety, depression, insomnia, etc.), consumers are seeking out positive media but, while there are many family-friendly or faith-based options, no home for “Sundance-quality” uplifting content exists. Lightbeam’s audience comes to us to reboot their faith in humanity: we appeal to “conscious consumers,” the very demo that brands have a hard time connecting with. Lightbeam helps brand create purposeful content and distribute it “authentically” to these coveted mindful consumers.  Lightbeam taps an exploding free streaming industry: in 2022 AVOD is growing faster than SVOD (29% versus 21%, Comscore), and we are also trailblazing with Web3. Lightbeam is powered by a hybrid business model: branded video-on-demand (BVOD) and tokenized video-on-demand (TVOD). With BVOD, brands no longer disrupt the entertainment they become it, and with TVOD, viewers binge-to-impactTM special assets, privileges and experiences.","Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Internet Services",1,Stephanie Sharis,1-10,2,Seed,610000,USD,610000,610000,USD,610000,,,,,Private,,,,,,
