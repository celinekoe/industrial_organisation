Seat location has a significant impact on the satisfaction of air passengers. Preferred seats are in short supply. Once preferred seats are sold out for a flight, passengers have few options for changing seats. The Solution. Increase the ability of passengers to access preferred seats. By creating financial incentives and an efficient platform for passengers who possess preferred seats to swap seats with other passengers, we believe that the supply of preferred seats will increase. In fact, a prominent branding and innovation firm recommended in September 2015 that airlines offer a seat swap app to enhance the travel experience of air passengers.  The Product. The Seateroo app will create an online marketplace where passengers may swap airline seats. A buyer uses Seateroo to choose a preferred seat in exchange for payment to another person, a seller, who will swap seats with the buyer. A seller uses Seateroo to make money by selling a seat considered to be preferred by others in exchange for another seat on the same flight. Users will set the price for any seat swap. One analogy for Seaterooâ€™s product would be as follows: StubHub for airline seat swaps.","Apps, Software, Travel and Tourism",1,Brad Pursel,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
