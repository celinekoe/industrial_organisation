Renewable forms of energy, such as wind and solar power, rely on manufactured components more so than extractable energy such as oil. A vibrant manufacturing sector will be needed to supply the new materials needed to rebuild America’s decaying infrastructure and to create a low-carbon economy. The manufacturing sector employs workers at all skill and education levels, and is a particularly important provider of jobs with good wages for workers without a college degree. It employs a higher share of workers without a college degree than does the economy overall. Manufacturing is one of the most dynamic sectors of the U.S. economy. It is responsible for roughly two-thirds, or roughly $208 billion, of all U.S. business research and development spending. U.S. manufacturing employment was relatively stable between 1970 and 1998, and never fell below 16.5 million workers. The United States lost 5.7 million manufacturing jobs between March 1998 and 2013. So what can you do? Imagine creating jobs with the swipe of your credit card or helping thousands of unemployed punch a time clock – all because you simply paid closer attention to your shopping decisions. Buying American-made is the most direct way anyone can support American manufacturing and manufacturing jobs. We, as Americans, have the ability to change our own course, expand our middle class, re-ignite our manufacturing base, and provide the opportunity for those less fortunate to join an expanding middle class.","Energy, Government and Military, Manufacturing, Other, Sustainability",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

We are currently trading on the OTC under the symbol EMBR.   The Company's business is the buying, selling and racing of thoroughbreds that can race in the allowance and stakes levels of thoroughbred racing; however, the Company will initially begin in the claiming level of thoroughbred racing. The Company intends to acquire 4-6 horses in its claiming division before acquiring horses for its allowance/stakes division. These 4-6 horses will provide the Company with revenue and a foundation to build out a stakes level stable. The Company’s main focus will be acquiring horses that will be capable of racing in stake races throughout the Country. However, the Company expects to maintain 8-10 thoroughbreds in its claiming division.   Allowance races are a race other than claiming for which the racing secretary drafts certain conditions (see below for more details).  Stake races are the top level races.  The purse money is significantly higher in allowance and stakes level races.  Claiming refers to the process by which a licensed person may purchase a horse entered in a race designated as a “claiming race” for a predetermined price. When a horse has been claimed, its new owner assumes title after the starting gate opens although the former owner is entitled to all purse money earned in that race.  Claiming races are lowest level in thoroughbred racing. Stakes and allowance races are races in which the horses are not for sale.
