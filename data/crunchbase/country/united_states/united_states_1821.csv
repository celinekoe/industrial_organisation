Their primary disease of interest is Age-related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD is the leading cause of visual impairment and blindness in older adults and one of the most common causes of visual impairment worldwide. Vision Genomics, LLC is focused on operations and development of its AMD Medicine TM drug discovery with a personalized medicine platform. AMD Medicine TM was developed using the advanced genomic and transcriptomic analysis algorithms already successfully used in cancer research and precision medicine in oncology. The AMD Medicine platform contains broad databases of gene expression, genetic and epigenetic data in ocular diseases as databases of drugs with known molecular targets and effects on gene expression in a variety of tissues and cell lines. It includes advanced parametric and machine learning algorithms that screen for drugs that minimize the difference between healthy and disease states while targeting signaling pathways that are pathologically activated or down regulated and accounting for pharmacogenomic effects. For years the founding scientists have engaged in projects related to the understanding of the interplay of inter-cellular signaling pathways in age-related diseases and progeroid syndromes and have looked for interventions to modulate and delay the onset of the pathological processes resulting from and driving aging. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) was identified as one of the disease models , in which some of the interventions may be effective. To accelerate research scientists decided to form a company and engage with the country’s top ophthalmologists to find working personalized solutions for AMD.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",,,1-10,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,Deep Knowledge Group,,1,,Private,,,,,,

Unfortunately, with the popularity of online shopping, many people make the mistake of just browsing an online store and purchasing one that they like the looks of and has good reviews.  While you may get lucky with this method, it often doesn’t work out the way you would like. Relax on the Couch – Take some time to actually sit on the convertible bed while it is a couch.  Sit on each spot and even lay down on it to make sure it is comfortable. It is just as important to be comfortable as a sofa as it is a bed. Lay Down on the Bed – Just like the previous tip, take some time to lay on it while it is a bed. Lay in each position, and if you are married, have your spouse lay on it too.  This will help ensure that it is nice and comfortable. Before you make a purchase, you want to make sure you can convert it from a bed to a sofa and back without any trouble.  While still in the store, open and close it several times to ensure you don’t have any trouble. If you can’t get the hang of it after a few times, you may want to look at a different model.
