We recognize that small business is critical to our economic recovery and strength, to building America's future, and to helping the United States compete in today's global marketplace. Although SBA has grown and evolved in the years since it was established in 1953, the bottom line mission remains the same. The SBA helps Americans start, build and grow businesses. Through an extensive network of field offices and partnerships with public and private organizations, SBA delivers its services to people throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, the U. S. Virgin Islands and Guam. Overview & History Since its founding on July 30, 1953, the U.S. Small Business Administration has delivered millions of loans, loan guarantees, contracts, counseling sessions and other forms of assistance to small businesses. The SBA was officially established in 1953, but its philosophy and mission began to take shape years earlier in a number of predecessor agencies, largely as a response to the pressures of the Great Depression and World War II. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), created by President Herbert Hoover in 1932 to alleviate the financial crisis of the Great Depression, was SBA's grandparent.  The RFC was basically a federal lending program for all businesses hurt by the Depression, large and small.  It was adopted as the personal project of Hoover's successor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and was staffed by some of Roosevelt's most capable and dedicated workers. Concern for small business intensified during World War II, when large industries beefed up production to accommodate wartime defense contracts and smaller businesses were left unable to compete.  To help small business participate in war production and give them financial viability, Congress created the Smaller War Plants Corporation (SWPC) in 1942.  The SWPC provided direct loans to private entrepreneurs, encouraged large financial institutions to make credit available to small enterprises, and advocated small business interests to federal procurement agencies and big businesses. The SWPC was dissolved after the war, and its lending and contract powers were handed over to the RFC.  At this time, the Office of Small Business (OSB) in the Department of Commerce also assumed some responsibilities that would later become characteristic duties of the SBA. Its services were primarily educational.  Believing that a lack of information and expertise was the main cause of small business failure, the OSB produced brochures and conducted management counseling for individual entrepreneurs. Congress created another wartime organization to handle small business concerns during the Korean War, this time called the Small Defense Plants Administration (SDPA).  Its functions were similar to those of the SWPC, except that ultimate lending authority was retained by the RFC. The SDPA certified small businesses to the RFC when it had determined the businesses to be competent to perform the work of government contracts. By 1952, a move was on to abolish the RFC. To continue the important functions of the earlier agencies, President Dwight Eisenhower proposed creation of a new small business agency -- the Small Business Administration (SBA). In the Small Business Act of July 30, 1953, Congress created the Small Business Administration, whose function was to ""aid, counsel, assist and protect, insofar as is possible, the interests of small business concerns."" The charter also stipulated that the SBA would ensure small businesses a ""fair proportion"" of government contracts and sales of surplus property. By 1954, SBA already was making direct business loans and guaranteeing bank loans to small businesses, as well as making loans to victims of natural disasters, working to get government procurement contracts for small businesses and helping business owners with management and technical assistance and business training. The Investment Company Act of 1958 established the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) Program, under which SBA licensed, regulated and helped provide funds for privately owned and operated venture capital investment firms. They specialized in providing long-term debt and equity investments to high-risk small businesses. Its creation was the result of a Federal Reserve study that discovered, in the simplest terms, that small businesses could not get the credit they needed to keep pace with technological advancement. In 1964, SBA began to attack poverty through the Equal Opportunity Loan (EOL) Program. The EOL Program relaxed the credit and collateral requirements for applicants living below the poverty level in an effort to encourage new businesses that had been unable to attract financial backing, but were nevertheless sound commercial initiatives. SBA has grown in terms of total assistance provided and its array of programs tailored to encourage small enterprises in all areas.  SBA's programs now include financial and federal contract procurement assistance, management assistance, and specialized outreach to women, minorities and armed forces veterans. The SBA also provides loans to victims of natural disasters and specialized advice and assistance in international trade.","Community and Lifestyle, Government and Military, Other, Professional Services",1,Dwight D.

One of the fundamental differences between SMA Hub and others in the space is Hub's ability to warehouse annuities by buying inventory using a line of credit, secured by the structures themselves. Most brokers attempt to purchase directly from the sellers agent through a court ordered process. There are many flaws in this process that can often result in trades failing to consummate while the potential investor identity could become a matter of public record. The warehouse approach employed by SMA Hub has effectively insulated the end investor from any negative associations with the transfer process and has proved hugely popular.    SMA Hub, Inc. and the Hub Business Trust seeks additional capital for its current secured line of credit warehousing activity. As a secured lender to the Hub Business Trust, the lender’s capital is used to hold long term fixed income assets on a short term basis while the assets are marketed for re-sale. The lender’s capital allocation is invested in guaranteed income streams backed by A rated Insurance carriers that are purchased at a wholesale discount rate. Further, the capital is quickly turned over, effectively resetting the long term fixed position to current day rates.","Commerce and Shopping, Financial Services, Lending and Investments",3,"Darren Thake, Jonathan Walker, Tyson Wright",1-10,2,Seed,3700000,USD,3700000,5700000,USD,5700000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Skyhaven Systems is a privately held limited liability company formed in 2017 that merged its former business, Reactive Innovations, LLC, into its new operations. The Firm owns a 4200 ft2 facility in Westford, MA where it conducts its primary research and development activities along with light manufacturing. Skyhaven conducts innovative research and development work in the chemical process technology area focusing on reaction chemistry, reactor design, separation systems, sensors, thermal management, and materials development. At the core of their technologies is a reaction-based chemical process used to fabricate the product, or that the product uses to conduct its operation. Skyhaven’s mission is to explore, develop, and commercialize novel chemical and electrochemical-based systems that larger organizations are disinterested in developing due to small market sizes, high risk, or lengthy development times that can be counter to meeting short-term profit margin goals. Skyhaven seeks out high risk development areas via responding to competitive solicitations and securing government funded contracts and grants. These contracts enable the firm to innovate and develop new technologies to solve government identified problems culminating in the delivery of research reports, operational prototypes, or a limited number of operational systems for use by the government. As a small business, Skyhaven owns the technology rights to its government funded research and development projects. The government receives a royalty-free license to use the technology for its needs while Skyhaven is free to commercialize the technology toward non-government needs. Consequently, the firm files patents and establishes trade secrets on select technologies to protect core development areas that are being primed for commercialization.","Professional Services, Science and Engineering",,,1-10,1,,,,,255998,USD,255998,National Science Foundation,1,1,,Private,,,,,,
