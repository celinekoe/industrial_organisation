Until now. vFit not only is the only shoe fitting technology that allows online shoe buyers the ability to compare the exact shape of their feet to the inside shape of shoes to visualize and determine the best size and fit, it is a vertical search engine for shoe shopping that puts every product, every store, every sale, coupon and discount, right at your fingertips. No matter what it is you’re looking for, you can quickly find the lowest price, the best deal, the right fit, or that hard-to-find style. vFit Shoes crawls the entire Web and with its search technology helps shoppers discover everything that online shopping has to offer. Over 2 million products from more than 60 online merchants are currently universally accessible through vFitShop.com and vFit iPhone App. vFit makes shoe shopping more efficient. Enabling shoppers to virtually try on shoes and find the product that fits, all within a single user experience. With vFit, shoppers can quickly and easily discover: What size of a certain style fits their feet or the person who they’d like to shop for. The lowest price for a product, determined from all the merchants carrying that item and size. Those hard-to-find items, or that unique and rare find.  vFit offers a variety of benefits to shoppers. For some it's finding the lowest price or the best deal; for others it's a perfect gift. Shoppers can save all their favorite styles and searches in their own virtual closet for convenience and future reference. They also can save their favorite brands to make a more specific, personalized shopping experience just for them.
