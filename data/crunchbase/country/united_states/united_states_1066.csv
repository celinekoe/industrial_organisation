Renew has developed a novel enzymatic platform by synthetic biology to create a diverse pipeline of proprietary therapeutic molecules (i.e. alkylresorcinol scaffold derivatives; similar to CBGA).  Uniquely, Renew’s scaffold molecules pass the blood brain barrier and engage a classic cellular receptor that controls inflammation (i.e. PPAPγ), together making this family of molecules particularly useful for indications of neuro-therapeutics. Renew is specifically focused on developing therapeutics to treat neuroinflammation pathologies, with specific focus on  Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).  No drug treatment is currently approved by the FDA for TBI, while millions of patients from all age groups are effected worldwide annually. Renew’s proprietary “enzymatic chemistry” processes are in stark contrast to traditional “medicinal chemistry” processes commonly employed by Big Pharma. While traditional medicinal chemistry often requires noxious reaction components and exhibits low synthesis efficiencies, Renew’s custom engineered “enzymatic reactions” are highly efficient and scalable.  These enzymatic reactions are particularly amenable for alkylresorcinol scaffold derivative molecules (that require prenylation-type synthesis). Renew’s platform for creating therapeutic derivatives by engineered enzymes is covered by a robust IP portfolio related to key enzymes (and engineered variants thereof) for production of alkylresorcinol derivatives by prenylation processes.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",1,Michael Mendez,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The platform was built to create a “hands-off” approach for business owners, allowing them to focus on their company and customers. To achieve this goal, we are constantly innovating, upgrading, and automating our services and processes. Reputation Loop™ was born from the necessity to automate our manual process required for our own consulting business. Prior to Reputation Loop, business owners manually requested feedback from customers via a review card. At this time, this was the only way for business owners to discover how they were doing, a method that proved to be inefficient and non responsive. We recognized the need to automate this process in a simple and easy way, removing the burden from business owners. To fulfill the need, we’ve developed a proprietary software and marketing solution that builds and manages a company’s reputation from one simple to manage dashboard.

Since the start of the pandemic, large companies have began to roll-up all of the small and medium-sized practices in the mental health industry.  This was accelerated by increased demand due to the health crisis, but also the transition from in-person to online care and additional reliance on technology.   This roll-up has put pressure on the existence of small and medium practices, especially those that do not currently accept payment through insurance.  These large companies are afforded the benefits of economies of scale and streamlined relationships with insurance companies.  Without a change in the market, these small and medium-sized businesses will slowly disappear since they cannot compete with these large players. Unify seeks to bring the benefits of a large corporation to small and medium sized mental health practices in the U.S.  This will occur through two principles.  First, through the development of software which can efficiently manage all aspects of a small to medium sized mental health practice.  Current software solutions are not bespoke to the mental health industry, and therefore are not able to operate these practices out of the box.  Second, Unify will manage all aspects of insurance relationships on behalf of the affiliated practices.  This allows Unify to negotiate as a large network on behalf of all affiliated practices instead of a as single smaller entity. Unify has three practices currently working as affiliates, including our in-house brand Meridian Counseling.  We currently have a total of 70 providers with 1150 active patients in both California and Utah.  We are looking for a strategic investor to help us bring this product to market on a national scale.",Health Care,2,"Kevin Lehtinen, Sandra Kushnir",51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
