Beat by Beat Press was founded by a group of young writers and educators from New York City with an artistic spirit and a passionate objective: to distribute high-quality musicals with fresh stories and characters for children to perform. Since launching in 2011, Beat by Beat has licensed musicals in over 50 countries and nearly every state in the U.S. Over 40,000 drama teachers and directors each month visit Beat by Beat's website to find high-quality children's theatre content and resources. We believe in musical theater’s power to unlock a child’s creativity and build self-confidence.  That’s why our team has spent the last seven years working directly with kids creating original stories and characters with them in mind. We founded Beat by Beat Press after listening to parents, teachers and directors tell us that their schools and theaters would love the opportunity to produce these fresh and original shows. They wanted musicals that weren’t just adaptations of ""adult musicals"" for young performers. They, like us, felt that kids should have a chance to act in something made specifically, and especially, for them.","Community and Lifestyle, Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment",1,Denver Casado,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
