BitTorrent is a globally-recognized creator of software and technology designed to help help people find, share and move digital media over the Internet. The company has built an orchestrated ecosystem of software, content and devices, all designed in harmony with the legendary BitTorrent protocol at the core. The BitTorrent Protocol, invented by founder Bram Cohen in 2001, makes massive files move efficiently over the Internet. Software The original BitTorrent and the iconic µTorrent are the world's most popular torrent software clients. They make it fast and easy for people to find, download, share, and play large files over the Internet. Content BitTorrent is currently building unique features to easily transform, play and share large personal media files (e.g. home movies, smartphone videos, and hi-res photos) with friends and on on BitTorrent partner devices. Through the Spotlight Artist program, users also have direct access to a library of artist-endorsed indie films, music, games and books. BitTorrent Certified Devices BitTorrent Certified devices extend the BitTorrent experience beyond the PC into the living room, home theaters, and smartphones. The BitTorrent Certified Devices Partner Program enables consumer electronics makers to join the BitTorrent community, reach a global audience, and solve fundamental user challenges with moving personal content to home devices. The BitTorrent Protocol The global standard for delivering large files over the Internet. It enables faster file transfers by downloading pieces of a file from multiple sources and concurrently uploading pieces to other users, overcoming the asymmetrical nature of upstream and downstream bandwidth. Many companies, e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Wikipedia and Blizzard, leverage the BitTorrent protocol to make files move faster. µTP or micro-transport protocol µTP is an intelligent BitTorrent protocol engineered to self-throttle when sensing network congestion, yielding capacity to priority traffic. The result? BitTorrent does not contribute to congestion on home networks or global ISP backbones.

The Associated Press is in the process of repairing its video and photography content: transitioning to high-definition, expanding its coverage and building a new and flexible infrastructure. It has one of the industry’s most sophisticated digital photo networks; a 24-hour continuously updated online, multimedia news service; a state-of-the-art television news service; and one of the largest radio networks in the U.S. The Associated Press’s commercial digital photo collection is one of the world's largest collections of historical and contemporary imagery.

Early in 2012, two of their founders, both engineers, were conducting an energy conservation project for a local school district. The district needed a way to easily manage its facilities remotely while maximizing energy savings. Their founders began searching for software capable of scheduling preventive maintenance to ensure energy savings, streamlining event scheduling to minimize the running time of HVAC systems, and tracking and responding to heating/cooling complaints to meet the needs of the school staff. Many of the software solutions they explored were feature rich but way too complicated. This unmet need for an easy-to-use but functional system inspired their founders to create a solution of their own. After developing the first version of a tool to enhance the energy project, they realized the benefits that such a solution could provide to a wider customer base—and FMX was born!

In 1998, Lighthammer transformed manufacturing yet again with the introduction of the first Enterprise Manufacturing Intelligence platform. Lighthammer revolutionized the factory floor by bringing both real time intelligence and live synchronization with the ERP software layer. This enabled the second software-based industrial revolution and is still evidenced today by the ubiquity of this software (currently under the SAP MII brand).

The barges are former military or construction ships with a 40 to 50 year extended life that are in robust working condition and meet all Coast Guard certifications. Nautilus’ first barge is currently under construction at California’s Mare Island where Nautilus has successfully validated its first proof of concept prototype data center. The proof of concept went through a certified third party data center pre-commissioning process and was validated by the engineering firms – Jacobs Engineering and Critical Engineering Group.  Since it is five times more efficient to cool using water versus moving air, Nautilus’ patented cooling technology leverages the natural water that the barge safely rests on and allows the company to offer customers a high-density computing data center environment. Specifically, the waterborne data center can be configured and operated with up to 800 server racks deployed in less than six months anywhere around the world. Nautilus’ cloud solution automates the infrastructure in an open source environment agnostic to any data center, cloud or application. Additionally, Nautilus’ DCIM solution is predictive with integrated artificial intelligence that self heals and provides military-grade security. The Nautilus approach competes directly against the traditional or conventional data center approach by reducing the build time from two years to only six months. The green data center build by Nautilus has 19,000 tons of lower emissions (equivalent to approximately 3600 cars) as compared to the conventional data center. With a potential 50% annual energy savings, the Nautilus design could save clients up to $4 million in energy use cost. All of this is supported with our Patent- pending technology specific to Data Center Vessel, Modularity, Cooling System and Thermal Containment, Intelligent Power Management and DCIM with Predictive Analytics.","Energy, Hardware, Information Technology, Sustainability",1,Arnold Magcale,1-10,3,Late Stage Venture,36000000,USD,36000000,136000000,USD,136000000,"Emerson Collective, OIC, Ireland Strategic Investment Fund",2,3,,Private,,,,,,
