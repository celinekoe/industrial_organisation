The firm was restructured in 2010 along four lines of business: Performance Improvement, Strategic Services, Business Analytics and Staff Augmentation, with offices and resources located in the US, Europe and Asia. The group offers performance improvement solutions for financial services, industrial and services companies worldwide.  The company through its true bottom-line operating performance is able to deliver tangible improvements that increase the enterprise value of a company. The company has a unique policy of working with only selected clients.  The group’s team includes former senior C-level executives with decades of consulting and management experience, supported by younger analytical talent with diverse backgrounds, recruited from top universities around the world.  Mitchell Madison’s client base includes large corporations with a particular emphasis on the insurance, telecom, media, manufacturing, transportation, retail, and business services industries. Most of the consulting projects handled by the company involve short-term performance improvement, leveraging the global market place for sourcing and outsourcing of corporate cost structures.

Interventional Spine product development was grounded on the basis of the Company's Compression (CLASP®) technology, which provides effective fixation in both normal and osteoporotic bone. Due to the superior fracture fixation characteristics of the CLASP® technology, Interventional Spine originally designed devices for the Podiatric and Orthopedic Trauma markets, successfully implanting over 4,000 Orthopedic Trauma Products in patients. The technology enabled surgeons to change the way they managed bone fractures, allowing for precise positioning with compression independent of thread movement, while providing superior pullout resistance and compression when compared to traditional lag screws.

The company’s personnel came with extensive experience applying DCS, PLC, process monitoring and control (PM&C), shop floor, laboratory, materials handling and other manufacturing execution systems to enhance manufacturing effectiveness in a Fortune 10 corporation. Their focus has always been to achieve improved enterprise performance by integrating systems across the enterprise supply chain. In 1994, Blaze Systems purchased the Encompass LIMS business from Enviromatix and released its first version of BlazeLIMS in 1996.  Since then, Blaze Systems has continually improved and enhanced its offerings and established itself as a stable and credible market presence as a quality LIMS supplier.  Their corporate mission is to be the premier supplier of total LIMS solutions that enhance customer enterprise performance.  Their ethos is to deliver and support well-engineered systems that fit the customer’s needs, which is another way to describe fitness for use or quality.  Their product and services offerings have been developed to facilitate achieving these objectives in every installation. Blaze Systems has the comprehensive product and service offerings for a total LIMS solution and a record of customer satisfaction of which they are justifiably proud.  For example, their total LIMS solutions are employed as mission-critical enterprise-wide systems by the world’s leading supplier of polyester films, the largest supplier of polyols (artificial sweeteners) in the Americas, and the world’s largest tissue bank.  In view of the current cost pressures in virtually every enterprise, Blaze Systems’ offerings provide a cost effective and total LIMS solution with comprehensive functionality, usually with a payback period of less than a year.","Manufacturing, Software",1,D.
