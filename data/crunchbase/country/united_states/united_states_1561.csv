The detection and mitigation of potential threats in real time are essential to security and public safety. Steel City Optronics has developed a new camera that detects concealed weapons and explosives from almost any distance, on subjects in motion — before they become dangerous to people and property. This fast and thorough security screening of moving objects is a crucial ability in today’s rapidly globalizing, fast-paced world. Metal detectors and security checkpoints are no longer sufficient to ensure public safety. Too often, dangerous threats are simply not detected by these traditional safety precautions, leaving people and property at risk. Since many recent threats have targeted public access areas ahead of the security checkpoints, a better security solution is clearly necessary. Explosives and weapons that people are carrying, while in motion, currently go largely undetected in real-world situations. Steel City Optronics addresses these, and other, issues with our state-of-the-art millimeter wave security camera. In addition to security monitoring for public safety, our cameras can see through common obscurants like smoke, fog, dust, and rain, making them ideal for situational awareness, object avoidance, and navigation.","Administrative Services, Government and Military, Privacy and Security",,,,2,,,,,940696,USD,940696,National Science Foundation,1,1,,Private,,,,,,

FDA is also responsible for advancing the public health by helping to speed innovations that make medicines more effective, safer, and more affordable and by helping the public get the accurate, science-based information they need to use medicines and foods to maintain and improve their health. FDA also has responsibility for regulating the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of tobacco products to protect the public health and to reduce tobacco use by minors. Finally, FDA plays a significant role in the Nationâ€:tm:s counterterrorism capability. FDA fulfills this responsibility by ensuring the security of the food supply and by fostering development of medical products to respond to deliberate and naturally emerging public health threats. History The Food and Drug Administration is the oldest comprehensive consumer protection agency in the U. S. federal government. Its origins can be traced back to the appointment of Lewis Caleb Beck in the Patent Office around 1848 to carry out chemical analyses of agricultural products, a function that the newly created Department of Agriculture inherited in 1862. Although it was not known by its present name until 1930, FDAâ€:tm:s modern regulatory functions began with the passage of the 1906 Pure Food and Drugs Act, a law a quarter-century in the making that prohibited interstate commerce in adulterated and misbranded food and drugs. Harvey Washington Wiley, Chief Chemist of the Bureau of Chemistry in the Department of Agriculture, had been the driving force behind this law and headed its enforcement in the early years, providing basic elements of protection that consumers had never known before that time. The FDA and its responsibilities have undergone a metamorphosis since 1906. Similarly, the marketplace itself, the sciences undergirding the products the agency regulates, and the social, cultural, political, and economic changes that have formed the context for these developments, all have witnessed upheavals over the past century. Yet the core public health mission of the agency remains now as it did then. This web site features a variety of portals that offer insight into these changes, from overviews on how consumer protection laws evolved, to case studies that explore and interpret the agencyâ€:tm:s work and policies. In addition, the visitor will find links to key related web sites as well as citations to valuable sources to help understand the history of FDA.","Government and Military, Health Care, Professional Services",2,"Harvey Washington Wiley, Theodore Roosevelt",10001+,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
