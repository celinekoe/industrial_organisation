In 1984, Boyds also introduced its first major plush product, a unique, fully-jointed wool teddy bear named MATTHEW-TM-, and the GNOMES HOMES-TM-, a small collection of hand-sculpted miniature cast resin houses. Boyds relocated from Maryland to southern Pennsylvania in 1987 in order to take advantage of more favorable labor markets. The product line was expanded to include other plush animals and related accessories including miniature clothes, furniture and ornaments. Boyds began distributing its plush animal lines to department stores and gift retailers, opting against selling to mass merchandisers, major discount stores and toy chains. This strategy strengthened Boyds' relationship with its retailers, a competitive advantage which exists today. In 1993, Boyds began selling cast resin figurines with the introduction of its BEARSTONES line.","Clothing and Apparel, Commerce and Shopping, Consumer Goods, Design",,,251-500,,IPO,,,,,,,,,,,Delisted,1999-03-05,2005-10-11,day,FOB,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/boyds-collection-ipo--486eda9b,NYSE - New York Stock Exchange

Harrison began his career as a litigation attorney after attending the University of Chicago, where he received his bachelor's in political studies, and graduating from the University of Virginia Law School. After three years of practice, Barnes founded Juriscape, under which he developed a collection of industry-specific job-search websites that revolutionized the way job seekers access employment postings from around the world.

Following on the success of those endeavors, Harrison started Legal Authority which offers resume development and distribution services for attorneys and paralegals. Legal Authority is the largest and the most comprehensive portal of legal employment opportunities in the world. The methods the company employs to get jobs for legal professionals are inexpensive, quick, and effective. Hundreds of attorneys throughout the United States have landed with jobs, thanks to Legal Authority. The process is simple, but profound.

Using their database, Legal Authority provides the legal job seeker with customized letters, envelopes, and resumes for application to legal jobs, in every area of practice, in every city and every country any legal professional could ever want to work-whether one is interested in one employer or a thousand employers.

The site uses the world's most sophisticated database of legal employers and enhances attorneys' lives by penetrating markets on their behalf to get them the exposure"" to employers that they need. No recruiters, no job-posting boards, and no classified ads can do what they do. The beauty of what Legal Authority does is that they put job seekers in control of their own destinies. The company happens to be Harrison Barnes' favorite company out of his other 14 companies.","Information Technology, Internet Services, Messaging and Telecommunications, Other, Professional Services",,,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
