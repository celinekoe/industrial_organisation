The question is, how do I even start! Who is going to buy my house in Meriden Connecticut? Is listing my Meriden house my best option? Won’t listing my Meriden Connecticut property mean that it will sit on the market for months? Not to mention paying realtor fees, even repairs. The point of selling my Meriden house was to get cash (not spend it on repairs) and get rid of the hassle, not adding more. Appears to be counterproductive …”. Indeed we hear this often. Well imagine receiving a no-obligation cash offer on your house in Meriden CT, just 24 hours after you fill in the form. Then picture yourself, if you will, cashing a check of the amount agreed on just 10 days later. Suddenly, no more wondering what the tenants are doing. Or wondering how you are going to put funds aside to fix that leaky roof. You are done. Free and clear with the cash previously agreed upon. A happy ending and a win for all situation!""","Real Estate, Sales and Marketing",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
