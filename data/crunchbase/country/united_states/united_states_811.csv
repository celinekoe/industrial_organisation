Selling right in the social space, and it's just beginning to take off! 74% of consumers rely on social networks to guide their purchase decisions, and the switch to s-commerce is due to a few key variables: - more time spent on social networks - brands getting outside of fan pages and targeting consumers in their direct news feeds - technology advances such as geo-location So what does all this have to do with small fashion boutiques? THE PROBLEM:  Small fashion boutiques are a major market niche across the map & the majority are not selling online or manage a one-dimensional online presence.  The very few that have tapped in to selling limited quantities in the social space manage a time-consuming and manual selling system via facebook.

It is a family operated 501(c)(3) organization. The board of directors consists of John, John & Joan's six children and their spouses. At present, we are in the process of inviting third-generation family to the board, bringing fresh and new ideas to the table. John founded The Metrix Company, a medical device manufacturer in Dubuque, Iowa. The company got its start in 1964 as the Riggs Biochemical Company. Its primary business at the time was the collection and processing of fetal bovine serum. In 1979 the company purchased Chicago based Medical Manufacturing Services, a veterinary device manufacturer, and started to manufacture disposable bags. Metrix was incorporated in 1980.  The company continued to grow and began manufacturing medical devices for human use. In 1996, Metrix purchased Secure Medical Products, a manufacturer of TPN products. In 2001, Metrix opened a second location in San Cristobal, Dominican Republic. Due to the success of The Metrix Company and its sister company Metrix Domincana, John and Joan felt the need to give back to the communities that were so instrumental in their success. The mission statement for the foundation begins with this commitment. Like The Metrix Company, the foundation has continued to grow and evolve. As the Schoen family has moved around the country, the foundation’s goal of serving local communities has moved with them. The goal of empowering individuals and funding health, wellness, and families, will guide our foundation into the future. No member of the board or the operational staff accept a salary. Over 98% of all allocated funds are donated to charity. To date, our foundation has given over a half million dollars to fulfill its mission.","Financial Services, Health Care",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

By Petro-Valve's 20th anniversary, he had established the company as an authorized stocking distributor for several top manufacturers. The company went on to secure many other such relationships and to enter a new 40,000-square-foot facility. Currently, Marek Menger utilizes his valve industry expertise in a new venture.
