PlanetReuse is a reclaimed materials consultancy and brokerage firm.  PR expertly matches reclaimed materials with designers, builders, and owners to save projects money, serve LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) efforts and sustain the planet.  PR grew over 300% last year.  Having encouraged and coordinated the reuse of building materials for hundreds of commercial jobs, our work has made us a national leader in commercial green building.   After spending the last four years building a reclaimed building materials network to serve the commercial building industry, PlanetReuse is now launching an effort to bring this monumental opportunity to every day citizens across the U.S.  Our aim is to make reclaimed building materials top-of-mind and easy-to-access so both commercial and residential building owners who need materials for a construction project, consider 'used' materials before 'new.’  And when it’s time for demolition or renovation we want reuse to be THE obvious alternative to the landfill. To increase awareness of, and access to, reused/surplus residential building materials, we will soon introduce PlanetReuse Marketplace (PRM).  PRM will be a national, social media-enabled website that allows customers to locate, view, share and eventually buy inventory from the roughly 1,100 for-profit and non-profit reuse centers in the U.S.  (e.g. Habitat for Humanity ReStore, Chicago's Rebuilding Exchange) that sell used and surplus materials at 40-60% off the price of new.  Reuse centers will populate the site with their inventories via our proprietary technology, InvenQuery, which uses a mobile phone application to instantly -- and in a single work-flow -- post new inventory online upon intake and remove it at point-of-sale.    The InvenQuery technology platform, which incorporates e-commerce and social media marketing, has been designed in collaboration with reuse centers nationwide and will fundamentally change the trajectory of reclaimed building material sales.  The reuse center industry is growing 15-20% per year, yet straw polls suggest only 2 of 10 Americans are even aware of reuse centers.   Furthermore, they sell less than 5% of inventory online, using a clunky manual posting process for Craigslist or Facebook.  PRM, powered by InvenQuery will change this.  We will bring connection, convenience, awareness and credibility to the reuse industry, ultimately making it as easy to shop online for reclaimed building materials as it is to shop for new materials from Home Depot or Lowe’s.","Commerce and Shopping, Real Estate, Sustainability",1,Nathan Benjamin,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
