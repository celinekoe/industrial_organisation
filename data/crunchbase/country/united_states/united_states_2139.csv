April 2014  8thBridge provides a Social Discovery platform to brands that want to empower people to discover new product ideas from each other, inspire the creation of crowd-sourced content, and gain a far deeper understanding of their customers.  Social media has changed the world forever – for the better – helping to level the playing field between millions of people and the institutions that serve them. No government, religion, brand, or company has been left untouched by this movement. Over 100 retail industry senior executives surveyed by KPMG in 2013 reported that social media is the #1 most impactful technology trend on their business.  We believe the term “consumer” will soon be retired to the history books as fewer and fewer people consume what they’re sold or do what they’re told.  Socially-enlightened brands work with 8thBridge because they not only recognize this new world order, but are ready to embrace it and begin reshaping their business around people.  8thBridge provides a proven path to social monetization for marketing and ecommerce executives that have not been satisfied with their ability to translate fans and followers into measurable sales lift.  8thBridge was recognized by the Always On Global 250 in 2011 as one of the top 250 private companies in the world.  8thBridge is headquartered in Minneapolis, MN.
