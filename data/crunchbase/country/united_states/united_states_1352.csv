As criminal defense lawyers in Colorado Springs, The Lux Law Firm, PLLC know the intricacies of the criminal justice system inside and out, regardless of whether we are talking about a simple traffic charge or a charge of DUI. We know that getting charged with a misdemeanor is as scary as getting charged with a felony and we’re prepared to fight tirelessly to prove your innocence. It does not matter if you’re facing a drug charge, a domestic violence charge, or if you are underage and staring at a frightening charge that requires a juvenile defense lawyer. The constitution tells us that every person is innocent until they are proven guilty and we believe in the sanctity of that statement. We also understand that law enforcement uses practices like coercion or unlawful invasion of a person’s property in order to make innocent people look guilty and we are dedicated to fighting against this sort of barbaric behavior. But we are also willing to admit that some people are guilty of committing crimes, as laid out in our laws, and so we are aware that sometimes the best strategy is to negotiate a plea agreement. It is this flexibility that allows us to react to each and every case we take on based on the unique circumstances of that case, rather than try to force every case through the same steps. If what’s best for our clients is to fight in court, we’ll fight in court. If it is better to negotiate a plea agreement, then we’ll negotiate.",Professional Services,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

A full service real estate agent with nearly thirty years of experience, Andy Esbenshade directs a small and dedicated team through Berkshire Hathaway Home Services. The Esbenshade team represents home buyers and home sellers, and each realtor is an expert in local market trends, mortgage estimate tools, buyer resource pools and more. Why is Andy Esbenshade one of the most trusted realtors in Lancaster? In addition to his expertise and his round-the-clock availability to customers, Andy has “seven generations of trust” on his side. His family can be traced in Lancaster all the way back to 1749, and Andy is proud to carry on their legacy while also helping new buyers join the community and immediately feel at home. Much of his business comes from the referrals he receives from happy customers, many of whom have turned to him time and time again as their real estate needs evolve. Andy Esbenshade has sold thousands of homes for a diverse clientele, including for sale by owners. He advises his customers on how to make the best decisions; for example, he suggests talking with a realtor and asking him or her to help you with the mortgage pre-approval process to decide your home-buying budget. Andy has earned the Prudential Chairman’s Circle Gold and Platinum Awards and won the Prudential Legend Award for being a top producer 5 years in a row. When Warren Buffett decided that real estate was a very sound investment his company Berkshire Hathaway bought Prudential Real Estate in 2015. Since then the Andy has won the Berkshire Hathaway Chairman’s Circle Platinum award. He is in the top 1% of Berkshire Hathaway Homesale Agents and in the top 100 Berkshire Hathaway Agents out of 36,000 agents total. These ratings have propelled Andy into the top 2% of the Lancaster County Board of Realtors overall, and among the local population, it shows. He was voted Lancaster’s Favorite Realtor in Lancaster Newspaper’s People’s Choice Awards in 2011 and 2012. He also earned the #1 spot as Favorite Realtor in Lancaster County Magazine in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. An active member of his community over the years, Andy Esbenshade has taken part in many local initiatives including (but not limited to!) some of the most influential real estate groups in Lancaster. He has been involved with the Lancaster Housing Opportunity Partnership and the Economic Development Action Group of the Lancaster Alliance, both of which connect people with more affordable and accessible housing options.  Outside of his industry, Andy served on the Board of Advisors for the PRIMA Theatre and was the past President of Landis Valley village and Farm Museum. Andy also runs The Lancastrian, an informative page on all things Lancaster. Andy continues to further his own education as well. He has completed courses in real estate appraisal, new home construction, office management, real estate law and ethics, fair housing and more. His affiliations include ABR, GRI, CNE, ASP, Realtor (a trademarked title with the National Association of Realtors) and E-Certification.","Community and Lifestyle, Real Estate",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

They’re typically single-day events held in partnership between law enforcement and community groups where anyone can turn in a gun, no questions asked, and receive some form of compensation. All guns collected are safely destroyed. The core rationale for a buyback is that that communities with fewer guns have fewer homicides, suicides, and accidental gun deaths[i]. To date, gun buybacks in the U.S. have occurred on an inconsistent basis with limited funding. As a result, they haven’t achieved a sufficient scale to demonstrate an impact on macro gun violence statistics. Because there is very little data available on their micro impacts, questions are frequently raised about their effectiveness.
