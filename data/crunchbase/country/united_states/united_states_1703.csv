Our sustainable solution is simple (like a home water filter on the end of your kitchen sink) and costs 70% less to install than the current next best solution on the market and 20-30 percent less to operate while terminating end-user liability for the utilities because the nano coating binds to the toxic metals in perpetuity so they can be disposed of in a non-hazardous state. An independent analysis conducted at Arizona State University shows CCT's chitosan-based, NMX technology as far and away the best of the 38 substrates they tested to remove selenium from water, and with new pending EPA regulations on the level of toxins allowed in power plant wastewater, there is an entire market of over 500 domestic coal and natural gas steam generated utilities that need a solution or risk the potential of fines, closures and trillions in stranded assets.
