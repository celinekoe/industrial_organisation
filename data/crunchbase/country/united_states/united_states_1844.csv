Crenolanib is an orally administered, highly potent and selective, mutation-resistant pan-FLT3 inhibitor. To date, crenolanib has been evaluated in over 400 patients across 19 completed or ongoing clinical trials. In Phase I/II clinical trials of crenolanib combined with intensive chemotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory and newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, composite complete remission has been observed in 68% and 85% of patients, respectively, as evidenced by the reduction in leukemic blasts to less than or equal to 5% in the bone marrow. Based on these results, we have commenced two pivotal Phase III clinical trials of crenolanib in FLT3-mutated AML: one trial in relapsed or refractory patients, and another trial in newly diagnosed patients. Both of these ongoing clinical trials enrolled the first patient in August 2018. In addition to its observed activity in FLT3, in preclinical studies, crenolanib has also been observed to be a highly potent inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor, or PDGF, receptors, and is being evaluated in several solid tumor indications where PDGF pathways are implicated as disease drivers. Given the compelling safety and clinical benefit observed thus far, we believe crenolanib has the potential to become a best-in-class therapeutic for multiple oncology indications. Our vision is to prolong the lives of cancer patients by advancing crenolanib in combination with standard of care chemotherapies as well as emerging therapies that offer the potential for synergistic treatment effects. In certain diseases which currently have no approved treatments, crenolanib is being evaluated as monotherapy.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",1,Vinay Jain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

An RFP is what agencies use to assess your project and then provide you with a proposal. At Big Drop, we receive tons of RFPs, ranging from small businesses to Fortune 500 companies–some are good, some are bad and some we no longer speak of. What we’ve laid out, is how to prepare an RFP for your website and how to create a great one. After all, the more thorough you can be with your RFP, the more accurate your proposal will be.   When you need a website, the first thing you do is put together a web redesign request for proposal. Submitting your RFP to multiple agencies is common and always a good idea — it’s how you get an idea of what it will really take to bring your project and vision to life. After you’ve submitted your request, agencies will respond with a proposed solution that outlines the scope of work, timeline, and cost for your website. Typically, this exchange is followed up by a brief phone call and a question and answer session. Think of your RFP as a first impression to potential agency partners. A great RFP sets the stage for a great partnership. A great RFP is clear, concise and gets straight to the point. You don’t have to have the technical know-how to create an RFP. In fact, most of the best RFPs we receive have no mention of code or technical jargon (we hear enough developer talk on a daily basis). If you know what integrations you want to use (MailChimp, HubSpot, Marketo) then list them in your RFP email to vendors. If not, forget it. You don’t have to have all of the answers. After all, that’s why you’re hiring an agency in the first place, so leave it to the pros to figure it out.","Advertising, Clothing and Apparel, Content and Publishing, Design, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Mobile, Platforms, Professional Services, Sales and Marketing, Software",,,101-250,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Established by an Act of Congress, signed by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863, the NAS is charged with providing independent, objective advice to the nation on matters related to science and technology. Scientists are elected by their peers to membership in the NAS for outstanding contributions to research. The NAS is committed to furthering science in America, and its members are active contributors to the international scientific community. Nearly 500 members of the NAS have won Nobel Prizes, and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, founded in 1914, is today one of the premier international journals publishing the results of original research. The National Research Council, created under the NAS charter in 1916 by executive order of President Woodrow Wilson, extended the scope of the NAS in its advisory role. The National Academy of Engineering (NAE) and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) were founded under the NAS charter in 1964 and 1970, respectively. Together, the NAS, NRC, NAE and IOM enlist the aid of the nation’s most knowledgeable scientists, engineers, health professionals, and other experts who volunteer their time to produce reports that have led to some of the most significant and lasting improvements in the health, education, and welfare of all the world’s citizens. The Academy's service to government has become so essential that Congress and the White House have issued legislation and executive orders over the years that reaffirm its unique role.","Manufacturing, Other, Science and Engineering, Social Impact",2,"Abraham Lincoln, Alexander Dallas Bache",1001-5000,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
