Thus far over 20 patents have been filled around the fiber-based display technology, of which 11 have been granted, and several more are in the works.   The fiber-based display technology will revolutionize the large flat panel display industry and Nupix, with its patent position and display knowledge, is positioned to lead this revolution.  The key advantage of the fiber-based displays is in the technology and stems mainly from simplifying the manufacturing process steps and reducing the number of steps by one half.  This simplification in the manufacturing process provides a 50% manufacturing cost savings over current display technologies.  Furthermore, the equipment to manufacture the fiber-based displays has a much lower cost basis and only requires 10% of the start-up capital of conventional displays ($40 million vs. $400 million+).","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Manufacturing",,,1-10,4,,,,,857633,USD,857633,NYSERDA,,1,,Private,,,,,,

Needing only a functioning e-mail address, users can quickly download the Yoomba client from the company website, and without any registration can contact other e-mail addresses over chat or VoIP call by clicking one of two buttons that automatically appear next to e-mails in your e-mail client. In order to chat or make calls, however, both users need to have Yoomba: if the other address contacted does not have Yoomba, he/she will get an e-mail directed to Yoomba's download site.  Yoomba is compatible with many e-mail clients inculding GMail, Yahoo Mail, Hotmail, and Outlook.  The service is great because it eliminates the need for phone numbers. Users only need their email account and an email address to make a call or IM.  Now based in Silicon Valley, Yoomba was originally founded in Tel Aviv, Israel as one of the world's first open communications companies.  It faces competition from other more popular services like the IM client [Meebo](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/Meebo) and VoIP company [Skype](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/Skype), which have larger user bases and offer some more features. Yet Yoomba is unique to offer an open standard available to any community: it connects people universally across e-mail address as opposed to over closed user networks which often involve registration and restrictions. Yoomba reached over 500,000 users in less than a month from its July 2007 launch.","Information Technology, Internet Services, Messaging and Telecommunications",2,"Elad Hemar, Ronen Babayoff",,1,Early Stage Venture,,USD,,,USD,,"U.S. Venture Partners, Global Catalyst Partners",,2,,Private,,,,,,

Sections include: Business, Residential Real Estate, Relationships, Cars and Vehicles, Commercial Real Estate, Jobs and Internships, Apartments and Rentals. Pat Gray and Todd Drowlette launched the site in September of 2010 in an attempt to offer premium quality as well as a completely free user interface which crossed several categories all in the same place. 	 HISTORY Todd Drowlette and Pat Gray were roommates at Siena College.  After graduation, Todd began his career in Commercial Real Estate whereas Pat began with a Tech start up in Albany.  During ToddÃ¢â¬â¢s career in Real Estate, it became evident that there was a need for a more cost-effective way of marketing and finding properties became evident. This sparked the idea for the website, which he brought in Pat for the technology side of the Business.  The two brought in others and the site was launched a year later.   Site Characteristics:  Business Section MoveThatBlock recently added a Business Section to their already diverse online classified service.  This service gives Businesses the opportunity to create free profiles which users can rate, review and compare.   Residential Real Estate The Residential Real Estate section gives users the ability to find and compare local and national real estate.  There are almost 2 million properties currently listed on the site which grows daily. Relationships The Relationships Section helps people meet, interact and develop lasting relationships ranging from friendship to dating.  With profiles being added every day, it is the best free alternative to online dating. Cars and Vehicles The Vehicles Section gives users the opportunity to post free vehicle profiles.  New or used, it costs users nothing to list their cars on the site.  The site currently approaches 5,000 listings and increases each day. Commercial Real Estate The Commercial Real Estate Section lists Commercial Real Estate locally and nationally. It is free to list properties and the list tops out at over 15,000.    Jobs/Internships The Jobs and Internships Section allows employers to list job and internship positions nationally for free.  There are currently over 1 million available positions listed on the site, growing daily. Apartments/Rentals The Apartments/Rentals Section gives landlords and owners the opportunity to list free rental properties on the site.  Users can browse properties locally and nationally as well as compare profiles. Reception: The website has received local recognition in the Albany, New York area due to its relationship with Siena College as well as the Siena student body.  Move That Block currently has several interns from Siena which contribute to site operations, marketing as well as advertising.  The site also sponsored the MOVETHATBLOCK.COM INDY 225 in New Hampshire.  This gave the site a lot of exposure as well as attracted investors. Yahoo News has recognized Move That Block in several articles as well as local newspapers such as the Times Union.","Commerce and Shopping, Internet Services, Professional Services, Real Estate",2,"Patrick Gray, Todd Drowlette",11-50,1,Seed,1050000,USD,1050000,1050000,USD,1050000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

This experience provides a valuable data base of outcome measures which includes thousands of mice at each time point. They have an accurate indication of the baseline for demyelination and the rate of spontaneous remyelination. We have documented that endogenous remyelination can be enhanced by therapeutic approaches that are documented by robust primary outcomes. Several aspects of our protocol distinguish our model from others. During cuprizone-mediated demyelination, we inhibit spontaneous remyelination with daily injections of rapamycin. This provides a baseline of near total demyelination at the beginning of therapeutic treatment. Without rapamycin treatment it is impossible to detect a therapeutic effect.
