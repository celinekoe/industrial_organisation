Over the past six decades, the business that was founded in a basement has become a trusted provider of electrical services. Today, its work portfolio includes billions of dollars of installed electrical solutions. Ducci Electrical has developed and installed some of the most logistically, technically, and architecturally complex projects in the Northeast. Its projects include major healthcare facilities, railroad and bridge construction, casinos, data centers, power plants, high-end shopping malls, state-of-the-art laboratory and education facilities, highway illumination and integrated management systems, traffic signalization, green projects, and historic renovations. Humble Beginnings E. John Ducci served during World War 2 in the U.S. Army as a sergeant and electrician for the 925th HAM Ordnance Company. After the war, he founded the Ducci Electric Company on July 1, 1949, in the basement of his Torrington, Connecticut home. Later, the company grew out of the basement and into an adjacent storefront. In the beginning, the company, then known as the Ducci Electric Company, focused on local service work, appliance sales, and repairs. Ducci’s wife, Francis H. Ducci, managed the company’s finances for more than 35 years until the couple’s retirement. From Tragedy, Growth for Ducci Electrical In 1955, two hurricanes hit Connecticut, leading to a disastrous flood of the Naugatuck River. Water rushed through Torrington, destroying homes, businesses, roads, bridges, and local utilities. In the aftermath, Ducci Electrical Contractors was incorporated in 1956 and the business focused on larger electrical construction work. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Ducci Electrical worked as a small regional contractor primarily serving northwest Connecticut. The 1980s and 1990s brought with them extraordinary growth, as Ducci Electrical Contractors grew by taking on more technically demanding commercial, industrial, utility, and healthcare work, while expanding throughout Connecticut and into western Massachusetts and upstate New York. In the 21st century, Ducci Electrical has become an industry leader, named consistently by the Engineering News-Record as one of the top 75 electrical contractors in the nation.",Real Estate,1,E.

Opporty ensures transparency and security, standardizes procedures, and creates an environment of cooperation that instills trust between parties doing business. Aspiring to become a global business marketplace and an expertise validation provider on the Blockchain, Opporty offers a solution that establishes and grows trusted business relationships globally. Opporty heavily relies on its Proof-of-Expertise protocol that, while collecting and analyzing transaction metadata, empowers Opporty’s scoring system to attach domain-relevant expertise to digital business identities and individually rank every vendor and service provider. This ecosystem allows for more secure domestic and international transactions, corporation and government procurement, and supply chain risk management. With Ethereum’s Plasma Cash Protocol as its underlying technology, Opporty has developed a permission-based version of the Opporty ecosystem called Opporty Enterprise Solution (OES). Plasma Cash protocol allows for the creation of child blockchains, which are governed by a parent blockchain. These child chains can have different consensus rules, functionality and underlying base tokens. Such extensions naturally fit with Proof-of-Expertise, with OPP as the underlying token used for manipulation, and allows for the development of private, blockchain-powered applications, such as Opporty Enterprise Solution. Given the technologies utilized, Opporty Enterprise Solution can be implemented onto third-party platforms and applications. It can be used in enclosed corporate environments that need all data to be kept private and inaccessible to third parties, outside of the system. Corporations can implement OES to enjoy safe and secure storage of transaction metadata, blockchain-based processing of transactions, privacy of selected transactions, and transaction analysis to assign scores for specific activities. Specific use cases of Opporty Enterprise Solution include: production tracking, food safety and certification, cross-border payments and clearance, supply chain visibility, automatic dispute settlement, and asset transfer.

As a result, a greater number of Millennials view “capitalism” as more a dirty word than they do “socialism.” Capitalism.com exists to dispel the theory that the government is the best solution to problems, and it instead strives to empower individuals to take personal responsibility for their actions, and to solve the world’s greatest challenges through contribution, business, and entrepreneurship. The focus is to inspire individuals to understand that the solutions to the world’s biggest problems won’t come from anyone outside of ourselves—that we hold the keys to change the world. Capitalism.com does this by providing politically-driven news and business training that defends the tenants of capitalism and encourages individuals to consider entrepreneurialism and personal responsibility. F.A. Hayek was attributed to saying that capitalism is the system through which a number of strangers come together to serve one another. We need to remind people that capitalism paved the way for innovation and allowed entrepreneurs to solve major problems. The entrepreneurs behind major disrupters, including Tesla, Uber, and others, have caused government to act. Capitalism.com seeks to stop government intervention in innovation and pave the road to freedom. By refocusing our collective attention to the tenants of capitalism, individuals will be empowered and have less of a need for government intervention. Our goal is to instill an entrepreneurial spirit in current and future generations, whether they become an entrepreneur, support capitalist ventures, or advocate for less government.","Community and Lifestyle, Education, Government and Military, Information Technology, Other",1,Ryan Moran,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
