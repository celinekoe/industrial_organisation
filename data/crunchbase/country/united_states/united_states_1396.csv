Their activities will be focused in precious metals to help balance wealth diversification for investors.  They plan to primarily incorporate into placer  mining where they are likely to obtain physical precious metals at low cost and built-in flexibility.  Their conservative approach is designed for maximum capital appreciation and very low risk.  A certain percentage of funds  invested in mining shares and mining royalty companies predominantly listed on the NYSE will provide the liquidity to purchase high-value mining properties, other undiscovered properties and to invest in existing mines to leverage near-term gains.  These investment targets must have good management and adequate reserves.  With over 50 years of mining and industrial minerals experience, their leaders know the reputations of most key managers in the precious metals industry and can make well-informed choices for investment dollars.  This minimizes the risk over following the advice of stock brokers and managers who have never managed or been involved with real-world mining and related issues. Why precious metals and particularly gold and silver?   1.	 Gold and silver are proven safe havens for wealth for more than 5,000 years.  Gold and silver values are both broadly expected to increase significantly over the next several years.   2.	World events will promote/enhance portable wealth investments like precious metals. 3.	The difference between precious metals and other growth areas is the convertibility of gold and silver. 4.	With their knowledge and experience, they can evaluate a given stock on levels very few people can provide.  They can communicate directly with known leaders in many companies to readily confirm what is going on in their businesses.  They know the companies well enough to parse out the low performers and risky ventures.   Advantages of this app","Financial Services, Lending and Investments",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

With God as the center, this program has seen thousands of lives renewed and restored. What began with a 12-week curriculum, Edith sculpted to a 4-day format with well needed updates. Over the past year as Levy Retreats tested the waters, it became very evident that the need was greater than ever but a facility to fulfill that need was greatly needed.  Currently, they have found a property that would perfectly suit the needs of the retreat. They are eager to allow those on the waiting list to begin the program and have reached out to hundreds of churches, counselors, and church staff to continue reaching those in need. Their only hurdle now is to find the funding to purchase the property.   The curriculum inquires of individuals:  Can You Relate?   * I can’t stand to be alone.    * I am a perfectionist.    * I feel unloved and ignored.    * I feel depressed if I can’t gain the approval of others.    * I over-eat often to feel good.    * Growing up, rules were used to punish, not teach.    * I can’t say “no” when I am asked to do a favor.    * I am out of control.    * My emotions are controlled and repressed.    * I have been sexually abused.    * Don’t speak, don’t feel, don’t trust.    * I feel angry and don’t know why.    * I am hopeless, lost, and feel dead inside.    * I feel I have potential, but I just can’t do it.    * I don’t feel like God could possibly love me .    Topics discussed include:   The Family System   • Family Roles   • Effects of Childhood Trauma   • Unhealthy Relationships   • The Cycle of Abuse   • Shame and Guilt   • The Process of Change   • Forgiveness   • Breaking the Cycle for the Next Generation     Their purpose is to see people whole and renewed and they will work diligently to ensure many generations benefit from attending.","Real Estate, Sports",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Acne is the most common skin disease in the world — 80 percent of all people experience an acne breakout at some point in their lives, often during the teenage years. Acne is a skin condition in which the pores become clogged with sebum (oil) and dead skin cells. These clogs are referred to as comedones or blackheads and whiteheads. Propionibacterium acnes bacteria found on the skin can becomes trapped in these clogged pores. As the bacteria thrive on the sebum and pustule begins to form. Over time this triggers an inflammatory response from and a deep tender cystic lesion may form, which may eventually lead to follicle rupture if untreated. Eczema, also called atopic dermatitis, is one of the diagnoses you get when you have red spots on your skin that become inflamed and itchy. A top dermatologist in Manhattan recognizes the symptoms right away and recommends the best treatment for eczema based on your current health and medical history. A chronic yet routine skin condition in people over the age of 30, rosacea generally manifests itself as the extreme visibility of red blood vessels in your cheeks, nose, and forehead. It often appears in flare-ups lasting for several weeks or even months, only to then temporarily disappear into remission. Unless you have it treated, it will continue to recur. Psoriasis is one of the more misunderstood skin disorders today. It’s a condition where your skin cells’ life cycle changes so that they regenerate much more rapidly. In fact, skin cells multiply 10 times faster with psoriasis. As a result, the cells build up on the surface of your skin.

Suffering from severe acne herself and getting no help from the “experts,” Lindy became a licensed aesthetician to figure out how to heal her own skin. She learned that issues like food allergies, hormones and life style, and even the thoughts you think, affect the health of your skin. To deepen her knowledge and skills, Lindy obtained certifications in nutrition, reflexology, and kinesiology (aka “muscle testing”), and she studied both the traditional lore and emerging scientific evidence about the healing properties of natural ingredients derived from the earth, such as minerals, seaweeds, clays, vitamins, oils and plants.  The combination of Lindy’s Healing Facials and Naturally Lindy skin care products have given Lindy a dedicated following of men, women, and teenagers, including A-list celebrities, Hollywood executives and producers. She is sought after by people with problem skin, as well as people who want glowing healthy skin at all stages of life. Actresses and models swear by Lindy and Naturally Lindy products, both for regular healthy skin maintenance and for emergency problems and flair-ups. Plastic surgeons use and recommend Naturally Lindy skin care products for pre-op and post-op skin care, and they report that surgery goes better and results are optimized. And Naturally Lindy products are so healing that cancer patients are using Naturally Lindy products to deal with treatment side effects such as severe acne, called "" acne-form "" rashes. Naturally Lindy skin products revitalize and balance your skin, leaving you with a healthy glow. From acne to aging and from season to season, Naturally Lindy can provide whatever your skin needs to become its healthy best.","Consumer Goods, Health Care",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Presenting yourself and your qualities over the internet is much harder than in person, so hopefully, this portrays who you would be hiring as best as it can. I am a father and husband living in New York. As I said, I have been working with Google Ads, Bing/Yahoo, and social media ads as far back as 2005. I started using these types of ads to make money on my own promoting affiliate programs. I have worked for various agencies on a part-time remote basis until I started my dream job as a police officer here in New York. Since becoming a police officer, I have always kept up with digital marketing promoting various products and services that work on during my days off. In 2012, I decided that I wanted to do something more rewarding and started working with small to medium businesses with budgets anywhere from $500/month to $20,000/month. I have worked with dentists, doctors, physical therapists, lawyers, dumpster rentals, plumbers, roofers, tour agencies, travel agencies, exterminators, car dealerships, etc. You name it I’ve pretty much worked with someone in that industry along the way. Now I know you must be thinking, “Why would I hire someone who already has a full-time job and a family that will probably not give me the attention I deserve?” Great question. With my current work schedule, I work mostly late at night and I work my 40 hours in four days. Then I am off for four days. So that usually means I am off around 15 days a month. During those days (and before work) I live, breathe, and eat everything paid search. I assure you I would not be running this business if I thought for one second I wouldn’t give you your money’s worth. Running a business has many moving parts that all need to be monitored by yourself or qualified employees you trust. You could hire an in-house internet “guy” or “gal” right out of college with no experience to save some money; Or you could hire someone with years of experience and pay for his expertise.  There are costs to advertise your job opening or hiring a recruiter to find you the perfect employee. Then there’s the salary, benefits, employment taxes, space in your office, new equipment, and of course paid time off. At the end of the article, one entrepreneur calculates that the cost of a managed employee costs 2.7 times the base salary they’re hired at. Notice I said a managed employee. If you’re hiring a web/marketing person are you going to hire an even better one to manage him or delegate his work to one of your current managers? Or do you plan on overseeing the work of someone in which you aren’t well educated in what they do?I always tell my clients to concentrate on being the best at what they do. Delegate the work you're not experienced into qualified professionals. Hiring someone new in your business isn’t always a bad thing. You’re expanding and giving someone an opportunity to make your business better. Plus you're helping the local economy. If these things are the driving force behind your hiring in-house then I wish you the best with your new employee. Going the outsourced route with Matt PPC is the smart move in this situation. Our rate is our rate and is usually one-fourth of what you would expect to pay a full-time PPC marketer with my experience. We have all the resources at our fingertips to start right away…….weekends and nights included. We never stop working to improve your online presence. That’s something you will never get with a 9-5er","Advertising, Design, Platforms, Sales and Marketing",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
