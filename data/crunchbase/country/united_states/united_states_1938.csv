It is the sofa store chain where you will find the largest selection of Fama sofas. In a research we have made, we have found out that approximately 30% of people who buy a sofa repent in the first two months of use, realising that they made a mistake and bought a sofa which does not suit their needs. We are aware that it is an important purchase, and there is a wide variety of products in the market, so we understand that it may be difficult to decide and sometimes you don't know where to start. In Famaliving you will find a team of professionals who will advise you on the purchase of your sofa or armchair. It sometimes happen that when we go to a sofa store, we try the sofas just sitting down in an upright position, or even doing the gesture of leaning our head on the back several times to check the comfort, while actually most people like lying on the sofas when they are at home. That's why it is so important when you are choosing a sofa to bear in mind what your actual needs are, and the way you normally use the sofa at home, and to transmit it to the seller so that he can advise you. In Famaliving stores you can see and try a wide variety of Fama sofas and armchairs, as well as a large display of colourful and original fabrics in a different and cozy atmosphere. You will notice that in addition to the attractive design of the models, their main features are their comfort, their functionality, and above all, the fact that they were designed to enjoy at home.

The label is offering rewards via the campaign that include jeans made of organic denim and Japanese selvedge denim to help fund its first production run.  Dulac has set a fundraising goal of $20,000 over the course of the 45-day campaign. “After five years designing denim collections for high-end brands, it was time that we created products we can call our own,” said Lulu Klein Dulac, Dulac’s co-founder and creative director. “Kickstarter is the most cost effective way to get our name out and offer our first products to denim enthusiasts around the world, building a community around the brand.” The premium denim market has recently experienced significant growth in consumer demand after stagnating in the wake of the global economic crisis. The revival of selvedge denim, a type of fabric with self-finished edges highly prized among denim aficionados, is driving the market forward. Dulac has adopted a price leadership strategy in the premium denim market.  “Crowdsourcing enables us to make selvedge denim products available at affordable prices because we can perfectly match demand with supply,” said Francis Cornut, founder of the brand. “All our products on Kickstarter are offered at wholesale prices.
