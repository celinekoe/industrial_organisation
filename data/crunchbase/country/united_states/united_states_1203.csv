A service provider  shouldn’t make you wait hours or days before they can help. You  shouldn’t get a four hour window for their arrival. And you shouldn’t  have to unplug your hardware and lug it across town just to take a  number at a busy help desk. To solve these problems, we created the TekMe platform to connect  highly qualified techs to customers who need on-site support right  away. Using our app, it takes just a few clicks to identify your problem  and service location. From there, pre-qualified techs who are both  close by and immediately available to help will begin to appear on  your screen. You can review their profiles to see their ratings, rate,  and other information. Once you make your selection, the tech will be  on their way within minutes. The service charge will be conveniently  billed directly to your credit card. TekMe techs are all highly qualified and pass extensive background  checks so you can rest easy. Contact TekMe now or download our app  to experience five star customer service on your schedule. The founders of TekMe have been in the business of providing tech  support to small and medium sized businesses for over a decade.  We realized that the best techs needed no supervision to perform the  most common tech support issues, they just needed to be told where  to go. So we created a platform where highly qualified techs could  connect directly with customers and work when it is convenient to  both the customer and the tech. TekMe was born. Every time you use TekMe to request mobile tech support, we expect  you to receive outstanding service. If for any reason you do not, we  want to hear from you right away!

Dynamic thrust science and currant time commands sent from a computing system are a better way. They are important, valuable, patented discoveries. Remember what is ready to start is exclusive. The aviation industry can have safer, quick reacting, agile, stable, durable & efficient planes that can be made in less time (1/3 of the time). Three can be completed in the time it takes to make one. I’d like to introduce systems that can improve how planes operate, plus assemble them quicker. When the science of dynamic thrust from the units is certified airworthy & reactive computing systems are ready; assembly plants can install the beneficial systems.  15 features of the systems are: 1. Aircraft can weigh less (about 1/4 less is possible). 2. Aircraft can accelerate 50% faster. 3. Lower speed takeoffs are possible. 4. Lower speed landings are possible. 5. Scoop units can change positions anytime to act as speed brakes to decrease speed. 6. Scoop units on piano hinges can tilt out from the body to create higher volume, faster air from the nozzles. 7. Aircraft can slowly glide to land when scoop units tilt out from the body. 8. Aircraft can have a higher top speed. 9. Aircraft can have shorter flight times. 10. Aircraft can fly higher (4x). 11. Aircraft can climb at a higher rate. 12. Drag can be lower when the units are in a neutral position because air slipstreams through without changing speed. 13. Aircraft can be more aerobatic or agile (especially in combat) even at low speeds. 14. Flying could be possible without operating engines (in theory) to lower pollution & save fuel because engines may only run to get to altitude. 15. Scoop unit nozzles set at 90 degrees can rotate 360 degrees (pointing up can push a plane down rapidly). The nozzles could vector air 30 degrees from level forward (to act as reverse thrust), then rotate 150 degrees to send air straight back. The features of the systems can improve air vehicles so they could be faster, lighter, safer, more agile, stable, durable & efficient.  All the planes and flying cars can have the advanced systems soon. Don’t you think it needs to be funded? We'd like a partner to help us.
