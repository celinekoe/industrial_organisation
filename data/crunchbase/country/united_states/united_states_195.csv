Its goal was to foster Amateur Radio’s participation in space research and communication. AMSAT was founded to continue the efforts, begun in 1961, by Project OSCAR, a west coast USA-based group which built and launched the very first Amateur Radio satellite, OSCAR, on December 12, 1961, barely four years after the launch of Russia’s first Sputnik. Today, the “home-brew” flavor of these early Amateur Radio satellites lives on, as most of the hardware and software now flying on even the most advanced AMSAT satellites is still largely the product of volunteer effort and donated resources. Though we are fond of traditions our designs and technology continue to push the outside of the envelope. For over 44 years AMSAT groups in North America and elsewhere have played a key role in significantly advancing the state of the art in space science, space education, and space technology. Undoubtedly, the work now being done by AMSAT volunteers throughout the world will continue to have far-reaching, positive effects on the very future of both Amateur Radio, as well as other governmental, scientific and commercial activities in the final frontier.

(PSW), a leading full-service public affairs firm, has been helping clients navigate the federal policy making process since 1991. Dedicated work throughout the decades has earned PSW an elite roster of blue chip clients and an enviable record of success.  PSW's achievements stem from our team’s relationships with decision makers on both sides of the aisle and profound understanding of how the process works, knowledge gained from serving at senior levels on Capitol Hill, in the White House and on national political campaigns. Each partner brings a distinct set of skills and contacts and the PSW team works collectively to maximize value for each client.  PSW's government relations practice is broad based and includes lobbying in the areas of federal tax policy, health care, international trade, energy, financial services, telecommunications, transportation, and education. PSW offers a fully integrated approach by aligning government relations advocacy with strategic business planning and communications advice.  PSW sets itself apart by remaining independently-owned. Too many lobbying firms in Washington are owned by large parent corporations that dictate company policy and demand growing client lists. In contrast, PSW employs an individually tailored approach for each client we choose to represent, never forgetting that the key to success lies in personal attention to our clients’ needs.","Government and Military, Other, Professional Services, Sales and Marketing",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
