Dialectic is the art of logical discussion to investigate the truth of an opionion or theory. During that time period, literature had a central place in the life of man.  Considered as the best way to convey moral values and principles,  and to attain wisdom, reading was recommended by the greatest thinkers and authors.  Similar to the Greeks and their great philosophers or fable writers (Aristotle, Plato, Phaedra, and Aesop)!  Critica Books is specialized in literary criticism of a wide variety of books and wants to help people discover remarkable books and talents. The magazine’s team are literary enthusiasts who want to unearth forgotten masterpieces, give their opinions on modern bestsellers and also unearth authors who deserve to be known.  Mason Ewing, President of MEC and creator of Critica Books, aims for this magazine to help develop children's critical thinking skills and give them a passion for reading.   When Mason was young, reading saved him by helping him to escape and dream.   In the future, Critica Books will bring together a community of journalists from all over the world and should become a reference in literary magazines.  The magazine will also create podcasts that will enrich the news articles and reviews.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment",0,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
