I  have designed a new kind of product that will help the 56 percent of dog owners that let their dogs sleep with them. I have a very large dog that sleep with us and he was all over the bed. So I made this design and it keeps him in a specific area of the bed and that is awesome. This can help the pet owner get a better night sleep. Mine was just the cylinder. My co inventor suggested add flaps and it works great.   Not only does this help keep the pet in a specific area it also help keep the bed clean and it can help some dog owner who have had pet fall off the bed keep them from falling off. I have researched and some dogs have fallen off the bed and caused injuries to them selves.  This can also have many different fabric patterns to match their bed or bling can be added for those who like that kind of thing. In photos the one  shown with the dog on it this was the first one made so it was a little small for the dog but it shows the purpose. We have had a lot of positive feedback.  We have a Pat Pending .  Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Brian Schmidt has been creating sound, music and sound technology for games since 1987, when he was hired as a composer and programmer for pinball machines at Williams Electronic Games. Since then, he has made a name for himself as one of the game industry’s leading audio technologists and composers, having personally composed music for over 130 arcade and console games.  During the design of the Xbox, Brian was the driving force behind bringing interactive Dolby Digital™ Surround Sound to console gaming, allowing game action to be heard outside the confines of the game screen and envelope the player. It is that vision that drives EarGames’ titles—that sound can be a primary driver of action-based gameplay, focusing on the use of HRTF 3D Sound technology.","Media and Entertainment, Mobile, Music and Audio, Platforms, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
