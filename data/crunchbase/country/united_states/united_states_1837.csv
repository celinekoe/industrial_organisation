The firm offers a wide range of dental care, diagnosis, and treatment services that meet the highest standards for quality and excellence. The Center’s main area of specialization is cosmetic dentistry.   Opened in 1998, Rock Creek quickly became one of the most respected names in the dental care industry, with a reputation that soon spread to other cities all over the state. Today, Rock Creek Dental Center remains the foremost specialist dental clinic in Maryland, with a renown built largely on its expertise in the field of cosmetic dentistry.   Rock Creek employs a team of top-flight dentists and dental technicians, all of whom have extensive experience in most every aspect of cosmetic dentistry. Rock Creek dentists utilize the latest and most sophisticated dental technologies in order to deliver the highest quality of services possible. It is this team that enables Rock Creek to handle everything from simple teeth bleaching and whitening to more advanced dental procedures with ease and professionalism.   Rock Creek’s dental team is headed by Dr. Paige Gaznavi, herself one of the most respected names in the dental profession. After earning her Bachelor of Arts and Sciences degree from George Mason University in Virginia, Dr. Gaznavi went on to doctorate studies in the Dental Surgery at Baltimore's University of Maryland School of Dental Medicine.   The next stage of Dr. Gaznavi’s training involved a General Practice residency at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, New York. It was during this period that she learned the value of individualized dental care and patient comfort, both of which she aims to provide to Rock Creek’s patients to this very day.   One of the cornerstones upon which Rock Creek’s services are built is patient care. Most patients are understandably apprehensive about the prospect of getting treatment, to the extent that they will avoid it as long as possible. Because early and immediate dental care is essential for achieving optimal results, Rock Creek provides patients with a range of options that alleviate their concerns with regard to getting dental care in a timely manner.   Rock Creek Dental Center’s range of services includes dental implants, cosmetic dentistry, Invisalign procedures, toothache treatment, and tooth whitening. Each of these services have been developed in order to address the needs of Rockville residents for state-of-the-art skin care and treatment, and they are delivered with the professionalism and attention to detail that has made Rock Creek the top dental care provider in the region.   Today, nearly twenty years after Rock Creek first opened its doors, the clinic remains committed to delivering the same quality services that has become the earmark of its success. Dr. Paige Gaznavi and her team are committed to providing the best dental care possible, and every effort is made to stay updated in the latest advances in dental technology. With continuing training and recertification, Dr. Gaznavi works to ensure that Rockville, Maryland residents have access to the finest dental care services available.
