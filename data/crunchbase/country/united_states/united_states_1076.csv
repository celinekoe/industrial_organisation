To that end, she only provides natural procedures that ensure long-lasting and natural-looking results. Natural procedures without implants and injectables. Revel You, Chaowen Wu, MD only provides 100% natural procedures — no artificial implants, injectables, or foreign objects. She uses techniques like liposuction, fat grafting, and radiofrequency energy to address all your cosmetic concerns, whether that’s fat reduction, skin tightening, or volume enhancement. These techniques enhance your cosmetic appearance via your body’s natural capabilities, thus ensuring 100% natural results. Natural results inspired by your own body everyone has unique anatomy that’s beautiful in its own rights. Rather than working against your anatomy, Dr. Wu works with your anatomy, enhancing and revealing your beauty rather than transforming your body into something it’s not.

Left unchecked, these drones present a serious threat to manned aviation so safe integration of drone traffic with existing manned air traffic is an absolute necessity. Unifly’s award-winning UTM platform is available on the market today as a mature software product that can be configured to suit the stakeholders’ needs. It connects official entities with operators to integrate drones into the airspace safely and securely. The Unifly platform allows drone pilots to check the legal status of their flight and allows authorities to monitor and manage drone traffic in their airspace. Unifly’s (UTM) platform is already in use today by the national authorities of Germany, Denmark, Austria and Belgium. Recognizing the value of collaboration, Unifly is an active participant in several leading European drone projects. Unifly is a global company. It is active in the US (LAANC certified). Unifly also deployed the first UTM system in Africa to support UNICEF’s drone corridor in Malawi. In Asia, the company provides the technical UTM backbone to ensure safe drone flights at the Fukushima Robot Test Field centre. Unifly as a company was founded in 2015 by a number of aerospace experts. Already in 2012, a team of air traffic controllers, pilots and engineers shared a vision of developing a system that would allow them to manage and track the growing number of drones flying in the air and to easily contact the drone operator if needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

It even works on surfaces that cannot be wallpapered such as textured walls, stucco, cinder block. furniture, fabric, floors and more.      It works like this: The first part is a 6 inch rollers with a design embossed on the surface. They have 325 beautiful designs and the ability to make more at a small cost. The second part is an applicator that  holds 1 or 2 colors of paint. The painting process is easy. Start each wall in any corner, allow each pass to slightly overlap the previous pass, add more paint to the applicator after every few passes, and go!       The business plan is to open a retail store in a mall so people can see the beautiful results. Some people will buy the product and do it themselves. Others will hire one of their licensed painting contractors to do the work. Once this business is shown to work in one mall, it can be franchised and expanded to thousands of malls around the world.      Their design rollers are made in the USA.  They are the only manufacturer in the Americas and plan to stay that way because they use special equipment and trade secret technology. They can even make custom designs at a modest cost.
