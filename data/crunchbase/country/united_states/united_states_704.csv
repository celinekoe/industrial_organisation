EverythingTree,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/everythingtree,Lead Generation,"Fort Lauderdale, Florida, United States",When Everyone Competes - You Win!,"3,210,210","Greater Miami Area, East Coast, Southern US",,Closed,2009-10-01,day,,,,none,For Profit,http://www.EverythingTree.com,"EverythingTree connects consumers to providers of services through a process they refer to as ""broadcast shopping. It essentially works as follows: 1. Consumers broadcast what they are looking for. 2. EverythingTree forwards this broadcast to Service Providers in the area (for free), without providing them with consumer contact information. 3. EverythingTree relays responses from providers back to the consumers. 4. Consumers choose a provider, and then deactivate the broadcast to stop receiving replies. For Service Providers EverythingTree is a free source of new business leads that is easy to configure and highly targeted. **Management:** Dan McCabe is an engineer with a strong entrepreneurial track record.  Dan recently founded and funded Avalon Integration, a systems integrator focused on SAP R/3.  Profitable in Y1, Avalon had revenue of $3mm in Y3. Before that, as CTO, Dan helped to grow Applied Tactical Systems, an enterprise software firm, from $6MM to $10MM in 3 years and a $26MM exit.  **Market Opportunities:** Consumers typically find providers by â€œcalling around.""  This is a time consuming and inefficient search strategy.  Service Providers typically generate leads via advertising or purchase them from lead-capture sites.  This is often expensive and ineffective.   We solve the ""matching"" problem above, at no cost to the provider or consumer. We disrupt the leads-for-sale (ServiceMagic & Redbeacon) models by providing our leads for free. **Target Markets:**  **PROVIDERS:** Other lead capture sites target specific vertical markets (ServiceMagic targets contractors; SitterCity targets babysitters, etc.) Our market includes ALL service businesses (contractors, lawyers, doctors, car services, nannies etc.). Many are already paying for leads through ServiceMagic, etc.  We now have 87 service providers including 3 national franchises. **CONSUMERS** don't pay at EverythingTree.  The potential market is essentially the craigslist user base which is to say, consumers of most any service, anywhere in the US. **Competitors:** There are many in the lead capture space, including: ServiceMagic, RedBeacon, ProspectVista, LendingTree, etc.  But EverythingTree is DISRUPTIVE: we are the only one attempting to monetize this space in this fashion. Our revenue model is similar to craigslist which is free to nearly everyone, nearly everywhere, but still has revenues of more than $100M with only 38 employees. **Competitive Advantage:** It is difficult to compete on a traditional basis with an offering that is free for nearly every user, nearly everywhere, nearly all the time.  Our early experience has shown that the EverythingTree model is intuitively pleasing for both service providers and consumers and while marketing is definitely necessary to get our message out, we are very confident about the sales conversion rate we will achieve.",Sales and Marketing,1,Dan McCabe,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

One afternoon, I didn't walk by, and I stopped to gently ask that question that bothered me after buying a man a burger. I was shocked at the answer that I heard, ""I can't get a job, I don't have an ID.""  And then I asked the same question and got the same answer as I shared meals with the homeless across the country. I found that a common theme for many of them was that they did not have proper identification. And you need ID to get ID.  And money to pay for it.  It's a vicious cycle.  A few years later, I heard the same stories on the streets of Philadelphia. Men and women wanted to work, but they couldn't get back on their feet. They needed help.
