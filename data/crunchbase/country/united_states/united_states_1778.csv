Cardiac cryoablation is a non-surgical, minimally-invasive procedure in which a cardiologist inserts a catheter into a blood vessel in the leg of an afflicted individual and advances it into the heart. Once it reaches the targeted cardiac tissue, the catheter tip temperature is lowered to approximately -90°C — thereby blocking the conduction of the abnormal signals causing the heart to beat inappropriately and restoring its function to normal. The CryoCor™ Cardiac Cryoablation System consists of a cryoablation catheter that is connected to an articulating arm mounted on the company’s refrigeration console. To facilitate catheter placement, the System can be used in conjunction with CryoCor introducer sheaths. The System has been approved for use in Europe and has been commercially available there since 2002.

As air travel increases, concerns about airport security and vehicle congestion are growing as well. As a result, allocating and managing curbside, parking and roadway space is a continual juggling act. Meanwhile, as operating costs rise and more capital resources are consumed by adding, expanding and maintaining airport facilities, airports are forced to develop and collect fees to recover costs, limit errors in fee calculation, address the potential for fraud and optimize rate structures. GateKeeper System's Commercial Vehicle Management (CVM) software utilizes RFID technology to monitor, track, control, charge fees and record commercial vehicle operations. The software improves an airport's ability to manage curb space, create new revenue sources from ground transportation operations and improve customer service. GateKeeper Systems works with TransCore, a provider of RFID tags and readers for airports, to offer turnkey GTMS solutions for airports. GateKeeper Systems's Parking Access Control (PAC) software increases security, space utilization and revenues in parking facilities. GateKeeper PAC software is designed for relationship-based parking customers, such as tenants, employees and regular customers, and includes features required in multi-location and mixed-use facilities. GateKeeper PAC software works with a variety of ""credentials,"" including magnetic stripe, proximity cards and RF transponders.

From lack of a clear value proposition, lack of an understanding of your product from a value-based approach, to not knowing what problems you’re trying to solve and how that relates to your prospect. The lack of asking your prospect good open-ended questions to find the gap, of what problems they face and how your product can help fill that gap, to unstructured onboarding and guidance, to the overwhelming amount of busy work that often doesn’t contribute to closing deals, we’ve seen sales reps, founders, and leaders struggle. At the same time, the tech industry is witnessing significant layoffs, with tech giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Yahoo, Meta, and Zoom considerably reducing their workforces. This industry shift has caused a surge of talented tech professionals to venture into entrepreneurship, launch their own firms, or join smaller tech firms that present substantial growth opportunities. Moreover, we’re experiencing a groundbreaking era characterized by the emergence of Generative AI, heralding an exciting new wave of technology. This transformation in the tech landscape introduces compelling advancements and opportunities. In this dynamic context, we see a unique opportunity to assist these emergent ventures and tech firms grappling with articulating their unique value propositions. That’s where HyprWin comes into play. Our next-generation sales enablement platform, powered by advanced AI, is primed to meet the needs of this rapidly evolving landscape. It leverages this new wave of technology and taps into the immense pool of talent looking to make a mark. HyprWin’s primary objective is to optimize the sales process, from prospect identification to deal closure. We leverage AI technology to create a dynamic, swift, and focused workflow that guides you efficiently in the right direction. Our focus is not to replicate CRM systems, laden with unnecessary complexities where only a small fraction of the features are truly useful. We adopt a CRM-agnostic approach and offer API connectivity, allowing you to integrate our platform with your existing CRM solution seamlessly if you choose to do so. Our roots are in the realm of microservices and laser-focused sales processes. With HyprWin, we’ve streamlined the approach, enabling startups to efficiently market their unique value propositions and maintain that crucial focus to facilitate rapid sales. We stand as a resource for individual contributors and teams eager to accelerate their processes and articulate their value in the most effective manner possible. Here’s how HyprWin addresses the common challenges and can be particularly beneficial to startups and smaller tech firms in the current climate. Structured Onboarding: In the wake of tech layoffs expanding the talent pool, startups and smaller tech firms are ideally positioned to harness the skills of these high-caliber professionals. With HyprWin’s AI-Driven Workflow, we eliminate the prolonged and complex onboarding processes, allowing you to swiftly integrate these professionals into your sales process. Our platform serves as a comprehensive workflow, designed to guide anyone looking to sell their SaaS product from prospect to close. This means that new representatives, irrespective of their experience level, can hit the ground running with HyprWin, armed with the necessary insights and tools to excel. Guidance: Our platform provides continuous guidance throughout the sales cycle. From prospecting to closing deals, HyprWin’s AI guides reps every step of the way, ensuring they never feel lost or unsure of their next move, which is particularly crucial for startups that need to move quickly and efficiently. Eliminating Busy Work: With the rise of “revenge startups” by those affected by layoffs, there’s a need to focus on what matters most - building a quality product and closing deals. HyprWin automates various time-consuming tasks, freeing up sales reps to focus on these key aspects. From updating customer records to ranking lead quality, HyprWin handles the tedious tasks so your reps can focus on building relationships and closing sales. Reducing Non-Closing Activities: HyprWin streamlines the sales process by focusing on activities that directly contribute to deal closure. Our platform promotes clear communication and goal alignment with prospects, ensuring that reps spend their time on high-impact tasks that lead to sales. With HyprWin, sales reps are empowered to focus on what they do best: selling. Our platform combines cutting-edge AI technology with an intuitive user experience, revolutionizing the way sales teams operate and helping startups and teams to navigate the current landscape of the tech industry. With the ongoing economic disruption and the surge of startups, the current market conditions create an ideal environment for new businesses to emerge. A recent survey of 1,000 laid-off tech workers conducted by Clarify Capital LLC found that 63% of the respondents started their own company after their layoff. As these new startups rise from the ashes of tech industry layoffs, HyprWin stands ready to support these bold entrepreneurs and smaller techfirms in accelerating their sales and driving their success. In the end, we believe that the key to overcoming the challenges in the sales process lies in intelligent automation, actionable insights, and effective guidance. With HyprWin, we’re making that belief a reality, one sales team at a time. HyprWin is more than just a tool - it’s a game changer for those in the sales industry. Whether you’re an individual sales rep looking to streamline your process and sell value in the best way possible, or a startup aiming to sell your unique value proposition quickly and efficiently, HyprWin is designed to support you. We are committed to helping teams and startups navigate the changing landscape of the tech industry, turning challenges into opportunities and driving success. With HyprWin, you’re not just getting a platform - you’re getting a partner in success.
