Mahalo includes the most appropriate hand found links and information about for about 10,000 unique queries.   By 2008 the company hoped to reach 25,000 profiles.  Not unsurprisingly, search results are generated at a limited speed, because of the absence of an automated engine.  However, results pages are often very deep and useful.  Searching queries for which a page has not been created are supplemented with Google search results.  Theoretically, Google users shouldn't have a problem switching over. Results pages are a mix between a traditional search layout and Wikipedia.  Any factual information is concisely listed to the side of the all links, while links results are split into different categories with the ""top 7"" heading up the page.  Results categories beyond the top 7 are decided upon by Mahalo guides.  These categories are tailored specifically to the search term.  Thus, a search for a person might include a professional profile, statistics for an athlete or a ""gossip"" section for celebrities.  Searches for companies generally include recent news, products or stock information.  Because search results are ultimately subjective, Mahalo allows users to submit their own links for consideration.  These links are voted on and eventually published or not. Although the manual creation process will force Mahalo to grow its index very slowly, founder Jason Calacanis claims the company can operate for [four years without any revenue](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/30/jason-calacanis-launches-mahalo-today-human-powered-search/).

Over more than a quarter-century in business, the company has cultivated a cross-country footprint that includes some 250 branch offices with nearly 3,000 associates. HomeBridge also has two wholesale divisions, HomeBridge Wholesale and REMN Wholesale. As of January 2017, HomeBridge’s servicing portfolio was valued at almost $17 billion. In 2016, the firm originated nearly $19 billion in loans, securitizing the vast majority of that production. HomeBridge holds current approvals for FNMA, GNMA, FHLMC, FHA and VA loans. HomeBridge continues to pursue a measured strategy of growth through acquisition. In early 2017, the company finalized the purchase of the operating assets of Prospect Mortgage, LLC, from Prospect Holding Company, LLC. The transaction added approximately 500 mortgage loan originators—responsible for originating more than $8 billion in residential mortgage loans in 2016—to the HomeBridge team.  HomeBridge is a full-spectrum residential mortgage lender. Its traditional products include conventional (fixed and adjustable-rate) mortgages; jumbo and super jumbo mortgages; FHA, VA and USDA mortgages; and reverse mortgages. The company also offers niche mortgage loans, including FHA 203(k) and 203(h), 100% cash out VA, construction-to-permanent, interest-only and energy-efficient, as well as non-warrantable condo loans. HomeBridge’s portfolio additionally includes some mixed-use and commercial loans. HomeBridge’s leadership team is helmed by Peter Norden, who assumed CEO duties in January 2012. Mr. Norden has more than 35 years of experience in the residential mortgage lending industry, including two decades as an executive.

From our founder Bill Larson’s first little Round Table Pizza Parlor in Menlo Park, California in 1959 to 450 thriving restaurants today, Round Table has always stood for freshness, innovation and craveable flavors in everything we serve. Most pizza chains use primarily frozen dough, and often skimp on both the quality and quantity of their toppings and ingredients to cut costs. Not at Round Table. We roll our dough fresh, from scratch, every day, in every restaurant. That dough is made from wheat grown for us on family farms in Idaho. Our cheddar cheese is aged to perfection, and combined with whole milk mozzarella and provolone in our famous three–cheese blend. We use only premium meats for our toppings, which we spread lavishly on every pizza, all the way to the edge of the crust. And our vegetable toppings are freshly cut at each restaurant, including our juicy, selectively–picked tomatoes. This commitment to quality and authenticity is why we say we’re “The Last Honest Pizza.” While we’re proud of the ingredients we use, Round Table is more than just freshness and quality. We’re the place where you’ll find unique, innovative pizza creations that expertly combine flavors no one else can match. Over the years we’ve introduced more than 30 successful new products, including many that are mainstays of our menu today. There’s the legendary King Arthur’s Supreme, with pepperoni, Italian sausage, Italian dry salami, linguica, mushrooms, green peppers, yellow onions, black olives, three cheeses and our Zesty Red Sauce. And the Wombo Combo, featuring primo pepperoni, linguica, Italian sausage, crisp bacon, mushrooms, Roma tomatoes, artichoke hearts and green onions. There are many more delightful combinations to choose from, or you can select your crust, sauce and toppings and create your own masterpiece.

In 2003, Bellco Credit Union and Bethpage™ Federal Credit Union took advantage of the opportunities to create a successful alliance. The two credit unions formed Open Technology Solutions, LLC (OTS), a Credit Union Service Organization (CUSO), focused on providing collaborative, technology-related services to a few large credit unions on the Fiserv platform. Bellco and Bethpage were joined by State Employee's Credit Union (SECU™) of Maryland in 2007, and S3 Shared Service Solutions, LLC in 2011. Together, they have achieved the kind of scale none could have achieved on their own - more than 889,000 members and over $14 billion in assets - ranking them together as the one of the largest credit unions in the country.  Currently, OTS proudly serves these members and their partner’s 2,000 employees in their consortium.   Operationally, the primary purpose of OTS is to create value for its partners by adding scale and efficiency to the process of providing information services. By standardizing and sharing the expense of providing information technology systems and services, their partners are able to access deeper skill sets and higher levels of service. Having the same core system was just the beginning of working together; over time, other opportunities to standardize and scale have been identified and implemented in many domains of technology enablement.   The key to collaboration is trust, but what makes it work is organization. An Advisory Committee, comprised of executives from each partner credit union and CUSO, meets regularly to charter collaboration groups, initiatives and efforts to further the strategic interests of the consortium. These groups, with members from all partners, are focused on domains of combined, strategic interest including digital, information security, program management, business continuity/disaster recovery, lending, member experience, payments, operations improvement and others.",Information Technology,,,101-250,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
