Each of airFIELD's 10-inch (25.4cm) circles is made of a liquid crystal switchable film laminated between two layers of polycarbonate to create large acrylic pixels. The sculpture requires electrical and data connectivity all the way down the piece so that each disc is able to fade from 0%-100% opacity. This changing translucency from totally clear to opaque white is the essence of the airFIELD's monochromatic physical animation.
