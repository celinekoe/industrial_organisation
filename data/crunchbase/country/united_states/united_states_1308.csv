Looking back to 1999, Greg Reisz, a native of Woodbine, Iowa, had an agronomy degree and several years of experience working in what was then the new field of precision agriculture. The entrepreneurial-minded man decided to return home and open his own firm—which was originally called E4 Sons. The initial focus of the company was soil sampling. “My customers always appreciated having me walk their fields to provide scouting reports or collect soil samples for testing,” said Reisz, “but they needed more in terms of getting the most out of their data.” In the early years, he started using software from a variety of vendors to generate soil sampling maps and fertility recommendations for his clients. However, he found that using different software systems frequently produced data that was incompatible with other systems, and therefore clouded the process. With his clients demanding more technology-supported services, Reisz developed his own proprietary software to create better workflow and analytics, which improved the decision-making process by using real, true data. E4 Sons was renamed E4 Crop Intelligence to better describe the business, which had quickly evolved into a full-service precision ag company, with its own proprietary software.","Agriculture and Farming, Information Technology",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
