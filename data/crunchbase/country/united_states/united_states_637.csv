The game play is based on a salary cap format where each fantasy athlete is given a salary, i.e Aaron Rodgers - ""$10,800,"" based on their real-life past performance. A user would pick a lineup, which varies depending on the sport, and would have to stay under a $100,000 salary cap.

Not only does this offer a new fun way to play, but it also allows for correction if the user picks a player that doesn't do well or gets injured during gameplay. The first ""Benchwarmer"" is free and the second is 10% of that tournaments entry free, i.e. $2 entry = $0.20 Benchwarmer upgrade cost that is 100% profit to the company and is not distributed back to the user or contest.

With sales, marketing and operations all built-in to the same system, you become a lean, data-driven organization. Increase collaboration, drive sales, build better relationships, and deliver optimized omnichannel customer experiences. The GreenRope platform was developed to help businesses consolidate their technology stack to help them become more productive, while also saving valuable resources like time and money. GreenRope, on average, saves users 90% in total cost of ownership when investing in a full-featured solution. With our robust feature offering, each of your departments can work effectively in the CRM while also having access to customer service, marketing, operations, and more.  Our pricing model is different from competitors in that we base our pricing on the number of contacts in your CRM, rather than the number of users. This means, you do not have to pay for every user to have their own login and password. Instead, each employee can have their own password and login with specific access permissions, all for the price of a single subscription cost. Our system is built on the concept that when the entire team works in the same software, as a business, you get full transparency into your efforts, business performance, team projects, the customer experience, and more. This model helps businesses save hundred to thousands of dollars each year. Your pricing is based on actual business growth, NOT the size of your team.  GreenRope's all-in-one CRM, marketing automation, and operations solution is built for businesses wanting to establish more effective business processes and deliver better customer experiences for optimal growth.  What are GreenRope’s main features?  CRM:  As a Complete CRM, we offer CRM as the foundation, housing all of your contacts and data. Along with a secure database, you have access to full pipeline visibility, contact research, CRM activities, workflows, sales opportunity management, quotas, reporting, click-to-call, mobile CRM, and much more. Each of these features ties directly into the contact record, so you have a 360-degree view of the contact and your relationship with that contact. You can then use all of this data to drive your marketing initiatives, as well as provide context for more productive sales and customer service calls. Our CRM is so robust, offering sales professionals, business owners, customer service reps, and marketing execs, access to the data they need to do their jobs effectively. GreenRope also offers a mobile app for on the go data management.  Marketing Automation:  Our marketing automation tools are incredibly powerful and help businesses bridge the gap between sales, marketing, and operations. Our drag-and-drop customer journey builder is your one-stop shop for creating seamless customer experiences. Use the email builder to create professional looking, mobile responsive emails, then test them out using our campaign optimizer. Automate specific actions when recipients open or click on your emails and send each down tailored customer paths. Our landing pages & signup forms make it easy to generate new leads and automatically add them to your CRM and any customer journeys. Plus, our A/B testing makes it simple to track performance from each of your campaigns.  Our automation viewer allows you to view all of the automation setup in your account, giving you the whole pictures, so you can actively see how client's move through your customer lifecycle.  Operations:  Just as important as sales and marketing is operations. GreenRope gives business owners full control over their entire business and this includes document signing, customer service, project management, learning management, event management and more. Our ticketing feature helps team manage customer service inquiries and other requests. You can automatically assign tickets to different people on your team based on rules, trigger automation, and activate reminders to make sure nothing slips through the cracks. GreenRoe's project management tool is a powerful way to track both internal and customer facing projects. Share updates with clients, track billable hours, set a timer, and more. Along with these two powerful features, GreenRope offers digital document signing, event management, and a learning management feature, all included with every GreenRope account.

More than 340 high net-worth accredited investors contribute to the funds, making it the largest angel network in North America. While OTAF founder, John Huston, is the Manager of each fund, TechColumbus serves as the Managing Member of each fund and provides key administrative and entrepreneur support.  The Ohio Third Frontier Program co-invests in the funds, and OTAF also has a strong network of collaborators and partners.    OTAF’s mission is to “Turn great ideas into prized companies to build entrepreneurial wealth”.  To-date, OTAF and its sidecars have invested $28 MM in 44 companies that have raised $355 MM from other sources.  Four companies have achieved positive exits and 10 companies were complete losses. The 30 active companies currently employ 421 people with average salaries of $87,275, and are generating about $50 MM in annual revenues. The typical OTAF investee is in the late “Seed”, “Start-up” or “Early” lifecycle stages – depending on the industry. We prefer software companies to have demonstrated commercial feasibility by revenue generation.  To qualify for investment consideration from OTAF, the company must be (or plan to be) the following:  1)	Based in Ohio (any region) 2)	Organized as a C-Corp legal entity, incorporated in Delaware or Ohio  3)	Part of one of these subsectors: IT, Life Sciences, or Advanced Materials How are OTAF investments structured? OTAF IV will make 14 initial investments of $325,000, and seven of these companies will receive follow-on investments of $175,000.  Individual OTAF members who are interested in increasing their exposure may write checks and invest alongside the fund as “sidecars”. Our typical round size is $750,000 to $2.5 MM, and if this is more than OTAF and sidecars will fund directly, then we will formulate a syndication strategy to socialize the company with our investment partners around Ohio and the Midwest.  OTAF uses a standard term sheet and deal documents based on the NCVA model term sheet for participating convertible preferred equity.","Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Other",1,John O.

Headquartered in San Francisco, the company competed in both the domestic and international equity and investment banking markets. The company was a registered broker-dealer with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and was a member of the New York Stock Exchange and the National Association of Securities Dealers. The use of “Banc” in the BAS’s name was indicative of the fact that the company was not a bank, and its deposits and other holdings were not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. During its years of operation its strongest investment banking groups included high-yield debt underwriting and Leveraged Finance, in addition to industry coverage groups such as Healthcare, Consumer & Retail, Global Industries, Media & Telecom, Financial Institutions, Real Estate and Gaming. BAS also did a significant amount of work for Financial Sponsors, or private equity firms, often financing leveraged transactions. On the product side, the firm employed M&A senior bankers throughout the industry coverage groups. BAS also had a stand-alone Mergers & Acquisitions Group, consisting of bankers that transact M&A deals across all industries, as well as a Transaction Development Group, which aimed to identify and market transaction opportunities. On October 3, 2008, Bank of America announced that John Thain would lead the combined Bank of America/Merrill Lynch Global Corporate and Investment Banking enterprise. Thain was forced out by Bank of America Chairman Kenneth D. Lewis on January 22, 2009, because of the colossal losses visited on B of A due to its acquisition of Merrill Lynch.

First, Drobots are controlled by TrackPaths, not flown by humans. TrackPaths contain a “hard fence” concept where the vehicle is guaranteed not to cross the hard fence without positive control.

Fourth Terminal Flight Avoidance / Positive Control means that even if the bird is coming down, it is still capable of looking for clear landing space or deploying some mechanism to mitigate terminal velocity and force of impact.

University research has shown that these oils attack octopamine neuro-receptors. Octopamine is a key insect neurotransmitter that regulates insect movement, behavior and metabolism. The blockage of the receptor activity prevents the transmission of the octopamine signals, which delivers quick knock down, kill and repellency against a wide variety of household pests such as cockroaches, ants, dust mites, flies, wasps, spiders, crickets, and fleas.

As anyone who has ever tried to recover a crashed or hacked website can attest, the ""back-up"" systems of many web hosting providers leave a lot to be desired. The back-ups sound reassuring in theory--you are assured that your data is always ""backed-up"" on a system that is completely separate from the main one and that you'll be able to access it whenever you need it.  When disaster strikes, your site has been hacked or your developer make a simple mistake, you often discover that your backup is hard to access, out-of-date or has been affected by the same event. CodeGuard is unlike ISP-based-backups. Instead of a static snapshot of your site kept by your ISP (hopefully), we use a File Integrity Monitoring system built on a version control system and store site data in the cloud.  CodeGuard backups are stored as the differential between each daily scan of the site; allowing users visibility into what has changed along with the ability to undo changes on their site and restore to a past version in real time, much like Time Machine for Apple OS does for your laptop.   If the current backup solutions for webmasters are lackluster, then the systems that alert webmasters if their site has been hacked are absolutely appalling. Webmasters discover they have been hacked because traffic suddenly disappears, they see a warning message on Google when searching for themselves, or they get an email from a customer complaining about strange behavior.   CodeGuard's differential backup approach revolutionizes hacking detection and remediation. Rather than relying solely upon site scans and comparisons with known threats, we scan files that have been modified since our last backup  This allows us to identify hacking and alert the site owner before they can spread malware, have their links pirated or act as a parasitic host for spammers--and before safe browsing alerts quarantines the site and kills all of the traffic.   In the event a hack or an unauthorized change is detected, webmasters can quickly revert to the last known good version and have their site working in minutes without engaging a developer to remediate the issue.","Information Technology, Other, Privacy and Security, Software",5,"David Moeller, Jonah Stein, Jonathan Hochman, Matt Chanoff, Merrick Furst",11-50,3,M&A,2000000,USD,2000000,2000000,USD,2000000,"Bessemer Venture Partners, Imlay Investments, CTW Venture Partners, Joey Katzen",2,4,,Private,,,,,,
