Commoot,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/commoot,"Advertising, Artificial Intelligence (AI)","Chicago, Illinois, United States",Commoot Brings Awareness the the Road by Utilizing Unused Ad Space on the Sides and Back of Trucking Trailers.,"1,466,036","Greater Chicago Area, Great Lakes, Midwestern US",,Active,2018-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,https://commoot.com/,"WHAT IS COMMOOT AND HOW DOES IT WORK? Commoot brings “awareness to the road” by utilizing unused advertising space on the trailers of semi-trucks, box trucks, and large vehicles. Graphic, eye-catching “billboard-like” ads are attached to trailers through heat-wrapped vinyl or a ‘poster’ framing system. Commoot helps brands by supporting brand awareness initiatives, as well as creating a stronger and more tactical campaign for clients. Beyond becoming a new platform for OOH media, Commoot plans to innovate in a few other ways. Commoot is one of the first platforms to allow quick and seamless OOH campaign creation through a marketplace website. Commoot is currently building proprietary technology that can track a very large amount of data through camera technology, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and geographical information systems, and more. Our technology can allow corporations, cities, and other organizations to make major decisions more easily through the use of our data.  How Commoot Benefits Brands Commoot benefits brands by ensuring their ad messaging reaches audiences more frequently, for longer, and in a way that does not allow the user to become “blind” to the ad message. Commoot takes your Out of Home marketing budgets further with more insight than traditional billboards can provide. Commoot benefits brands of all sizes grow their awareness and convert new customers by reaching them where other mediums of advertising simply can not. How Commoot Benefits Trucking Companies Commoot partners with trucking companies and fleet owners across the country to lease their unused white space on the sides of their shipping containers. Trucking companies and fleet owners benefit from increased revenue, which can be extremely impactful in today’s current economy. No need to worry about the ‘logistics’ of ad placement. Commoot does all the work for you, while helping you earn more revenue from your unused ad space. How Commoot Benefits Marketing Agencies Commoot allows Marketing Agencies to provide their clients with a powerful form of Out of Home (OOH) marketing and branding. Commoot provides real, actionable data to further supplement their marketing campaigns. Agencies can bring unique, exciting advertising and branding opportunities to their clients in ways that traditional Billboards cannot.  Stronger, more memorable ads = Higher ROI Learn More Why Commoot Works Commoot provides brands with longer impression exposure to customers, ads that are closer to consumers, larger ad spaces, and more data to support the advertisements. Different from Competition Refresh and reawaken the impression-based ad space by limiting competition and emphasizing ad retention. Move away from the cluttered online ad market and move towards an exciting, unique OOH campaign. Keeping Ads Fresh Most forms of advertising fall victim to “ad blindness”, which occurs when viewers have become too accustomed to seeing the same advertisements. Commoot solves this issue by working with a continuously moving medium, ensuring less ad blindness and continuous exposure to new audiences. Economic Growth By partnering with smaller trucking firms and fleet owners, we enable economic growth by providing an additional source of revenue for trucking operations. This keeps the operation more stable during volatile times. Data Others Can’t Provide By utilizing machine learning and artificial intelligence, Commoot goes above and beyond what other competitors can offer. We ‘digitize’ impression-based advertising with AI learning, making it simple and easy to deliver incredible, high-performing ads. Less Distracting Than Billboards Billboards force drivers to look 100s of feet away from the road to receive the message of the ad. Billboards are often distracting, and only hold the audience’s attention for 3-5 seconds. Commoot brings the advertisement to eye level with the driver, ensuring that their eyes are not taken off the road and the ad is seen for 10+ seconds.  Get To Know Our Process Step 1: Getting To Know Your Project We get to know you. We speak to you about your marketing needs, target demographics, budget, project goals, and more. Step 2: Creative & Goal Setting Our agency-trained creative team can design your marketing assets for you, or you can send your current billboard ads to us. We utilize high quality imagery and design to ensure that your Commoot ads are unique and memorable. Step 3: Printing and Installation Our agency-trained creative team can design your marketing assets or you can send your own over to us. We plan to utilize high quality imagery and design to ensure that your trucks are unique and memorable. Step 4: Campaign Launch! Our Commoot truck partners drive through select high-density routes, maximizing the number of possible impressions on your advertisements. Step 5: Learn From the Data We utilize machine learning and AI to understand approximately how many monthly impressions your ad received, the impression time, and many other layers of data. Step 6: Analyze and Repeat You gain a successful awareness campaign, and trucking companies earn additional income! We compile your ads’ performance and equip you with the knowledge needed to run more Commoot campaigns in new markets, to new audiences.","Advertising, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Sales and Marketing, Science and Engineering, Software",2,"Dan Salganik, Marissa Ryan",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

SERVING END USERS BRINGS BRAND LOCALITY We have developed several prototype digital content and social network websites because we believed we could provide an innovative user content engagement strategy to the Digital Marketplace-instantly delivering products, promotional incentives and digital content. Serving and engaging our end users is at the heart of what we do and remains our number one priority.  Our goal is to develop instant digital content delivery in concert with dynamic social network tools that significantly improve the end-users interaction with the internet. In pursuing this goal, we may do things that we believe have a positive impact on the marketplace, even if the near term financial returns are not obvious. For example, we will make our business model as widely available to potential advertisers in order to promote more cost effective digital marketplace advertising enabling a global reach of their product or service. Subscription is our principal source of revenue, and the subscriber will be provided relevant and useful tools rather than intrusive and annoying. We strive to provide users with an excellent opportunity to communicate effectively with advertisers and participate in the process of developing success products and services.  We are proud of the products we designing, and we hope that those we create in the future will have an even greater positive impact on the Global Digital Marketplace. LONG TERM FOCUS There are currently opportunities that have and will arise that might cause us to sacrifice short term results but are in the best long term interest of our initial stakeholders, we will take those opportunities. We will have the fortitude to do this. We would request that our stakeholders take the long term view.  You might ask how long the long term is. Usually we expect projects to have some realized benefit or progress within a year or two. But, we are trying to look as far forward as we can. Despite the quickly changing business and technology landscape, we are trying to look at three to five year scenarios in order to decide what to do now. We are trying to optimize total benefit over these multi-year scenarios.  While we are strong advocates of this strategy, it is difficult to make good multi-year predictions in technology.","Advertising, Design, Professional Services, Sales and Marketing",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
