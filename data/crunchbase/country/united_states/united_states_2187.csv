Kelldorf,  the founder, has spent over thirty years working as a petroleum geologist. In 1985, the value of Arkomaâs proprietary technical database of geologic and engineering information would naturally result in the pioneering of their first private mineral acquisition program. The innovative low to medium risk investment program was established to capitalize on the existing opportunities in the Mid-Continent Region of the United States to purchase mineral, royalty and working interests. Arkomaâs guiding principle of selectively purchasing minerals and royalties through a high graded methodology enabled Arkoma to continue its involvement in the Arkoma Basin on behalf of several institutional clients who were risk adverse to oil and gas investments. Some of Arkomaâs institutional investors have included Stanford University Endowment, Austin College Endowment and JP Morgan Chase Bank (Mercantile Bank Trust). In 1995, Arkoma transitioned into becoming its own client, retaining 100% of all producing reserves purchased through Arkomaâs in-house team of managers, geologists, engineers, landmen and business professionals. Profile: Arkoma Companies is a privately held group of companies based in Rockwall, Texas that is comprised of fourteen individual entities engaged in a number of business activities including real estate and energy. For over thirty years, this conglomerate of companies has been primarily engaged in oil and gas development through the acquisition of minerals, royalties and working interests in the United States. Arkoma has been able to successfully capitalize its intellectual know-how through wisely investing, owning and operating a number of businesses engaged in asset management that offer low to medium risk investment alternatives exclusively to high net worth individuals and institutional investors. Expertise: Arkomaâs technical staff has an excess of thirty years experience using unique proprietary technical data which includes production history, geological studies and reserve estimates for every field where the group has acquired minerals. This information, combined with excellence in investing, enables Arkoma to continue to be a pioneer in the energy industry. Arkomaâs turnkey approach combines both science and finance creating a business model like no other. For more than thirty years the group has successfully leveraged its core assets, which is the technical information capable of translating useful knowledge for decision-making and business innovation that is effectively applied to capitalize on investment opportunities. Arkoma Companies employs elite geologists, engineers and business professionals that are at the forefront of technical developments and investment strategies within the energy industry. The companyâs research and engineering operations reflect a commitment to directly contribute to the development of the future in oil and gas innovation. Although what Arkoma has found so far is exciting, it is only the beginning. The potential is infinite.","Energy, Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Natural Resources",1,Mark Kelldorf,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
