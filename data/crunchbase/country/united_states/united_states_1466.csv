Generally communication can be done through verbal and non verbal. Non-verbal communication regulates relationships between messages and meaning, and may support or replace verbal communication. It is impossible to complete human communication without non-verbal one. Body language penetrates the personal secrets of strangers, friends and lovers by interpreting their body movements and how to make use of body language powers but now a day’s most of digital communication such as the testing with phone, email using Internet using computers just uses typing WORDS. However, a human communication is composed of not only words, but also sensitivity-like non-verbal one. Non-verbal information like the human voice, gesture, and emotion rather than verbal one is more useful to understand the user's inclination exactly. However it is quite difficult to catch the meaning of non-verbal information without looking at recording video of the person non-verbal behaviour. One of main feature of Viotalk is recording cloud video so it doesn’t use your internal storage or external storage all the recordings on the server which are highly secured. User can record the video up to 3 hours instantly share with their friends and family and you can also add personal touch messages.
