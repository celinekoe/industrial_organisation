Its function is to electrically stimulate the circuitry of an assembled circuit board to PASS / FAIL “and” identify any failures as a product reaches the end of a line. The more complex a design, the higher the failure rate and the more ICT becomes a company’s only practical solution to verify the 2 to 12% typical failure rate.The biggest problem companies having with ICT is the cost of the test fixtures that make the mechanical connection between the equipment and the assembled board.  The traditional solutions that all companies buy today have been made exactly the same as they were 35 years ago. And the reason there has been zero innovations to fix the problem, is because compamies like Agilent ( HP ) & Teradyne who control most of the global market couldnt change the mechanical designs of the equipment interface because new introductions had to be able to support the existing fixtures and files customers already owned.

More often it is easier for teams to utilize excel to manage a project but there is a lack of connectivity to a kanban board and there quickly becomes reporting gaps. Further, when technology is deployed to manage projects, the administrative tasks often lead to additional frustration or worse a failed initiative. Additionally, while we love kanban boards, during time spent at Harvard University, Cornell University, Indiana University, and Western Governors University we evaluated modern work management and technology. What we found was while there are many alternatives, none focused on the user experience but rather approached work from a singular methodology and has limitations as complexity grows. ProjectBIOS is the first human focused technology that: - Enables best practices from the Project Management Institute, Management & Strategy Institute, Harvard University, Cornell University, Indiana University, and Western Governors University including but not limited to managing inputs and outputs such as requirements and mockups as inputs with acceptance criteria and testing evidence as outputs. - Supports waterfall, agile, and hybrid approaches within the same workstream. - Focuses on delivering benefits by nesting the inputs/outputs and process required instead of the traditional approach to list the individual steps resulting in unclear status of the expected benefits outlined in the project charter. - Provides the ability to stack projects, programs, portfolios, and product development into a singular view with unified, real-time reporting. - Allows the user to see their list of deliverables across all workstreams organized using best practices from the Project Management Institute to improve outcomes including but not limited to sorting the activities while considering priority, due date, progress and other important aspects. - Allows each team member to keep private notes and post public updates on each deliverable so that external lists, notes, or tools are no longer needed to provide a single source of truth. - Provides an integrated project plan for teams, clients, and third-parties while controlling which activities are available to be viewed and worked. - Is built to simplify complexity while empowering team members to succeed. - Will revolutionize work management including but not limited to risk management, resource management, process optimization, and client management through the use of artificial intelligence (AI).",,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Hengye USA distributes and sells a variety of molecular sieves including Angstrom Molecular Sieves, Carbon, Zeolite, and Mesoporous. Molecular sieves are crystalline metal aluminosilicates having a three-dimensional interconnecting network of silica and alumina tetrahedra.  Natural water of hydration is removed from this network by heating to produce uniform cavities which selectively adsorb molecules of a specific size. A4 to 8-mesh sieve is normally used in gasphase applications, while the 8 to 12-mesh type is common in liquidphase applications. The powder forms of the 3A, 4A, 5A and 13X molecular sieves are suitable for specialized applications.  Long known for their drying capacity (even to 90Â°C), molecular sieves have recently demonstrated utility in synthetic organic procedures, frequently allowing isolation of desired products from condensation reactions that are governed by generally unfavorable equilibria.   These synthetic zeolites have been shown to remove water, alcohols (including methanol and ethanol), and HCl from such systems as ketimine and enamine syntheses, ester condensations, and the conversion of unsaturated aldehydes to polyenals.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Manufacturing, Science and Engineering",1,Bob Trownsell,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
