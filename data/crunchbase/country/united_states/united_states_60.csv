TapEx provides same-day shipping and local delivery for anything, right from your smartphone. TapEx connects customers to local couriers to enable delivery from anyone to anyone in record time, for a fraction of the price charged by traditional couriers and messengers.   - Problems:  1. Unmet needs. Same-day, local delivery is widely unavailable for many of the products consumers & businesses need every day  2. Old business model. Traditional couriers & messengers who do offer same-day delivery charge obscene amounts, lack price transparency, must be scheduled hours in advance, and don’t integrate into e-commerce platforms  3. Safety & Security. Regional carriers (FedEx, UPS) packages are often lost or stolen, even when customers are notified that packages have been “safely” delivered.   - Solution/Service Offering  TapEx brings an offline industry online, and offers a simple, on-demand solution to consumers. They offer same-day local delivery that is trackable, transparent, and trustworthy. TapEx is the solution for busy individuals, as well as businesses seeking to offer a same-day delivery option for their customers.   - Differentiation  TapEx operates an asset-light model, contracting with individual drivers in the sharing economy. They will drive out traditional couriers and messengers and capture market share from large regional carriers. TapEx received significant PR when featured with Uber & Airbnb executives at the 2015 Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Nairobi, Kenya with The White House and U.S. Department of State.","Administrative Services, Other, Transportation",3,"Chris Garcia, Kyle Stephens, Sandeep Chauhan",1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The collection we curate satisfies modernists and classicists alike. Our understanding of vintage and contemporary eyewear and sunwear makes us an authority on how glasses should be crafted, how they should feel, and what they should express through a quintessentially New York mixture of style and attitude. New York City is the DNA of our own brand. Hexagonal walkway tiles in New York City Parks inspire the custom hexagonal riveting and eye wire. Frames are named for Manhattan bus routes.  But we are global and timeless in handpicking our component details: Japanese and Italian acetates, Japanese lenses, OBE barrel hinges, custom titanium eyewire, custom hexagonal rivets, and hand-polishing and assembly in China. Silver Lining Opticians employs fully licensed opticians, ready to fill prescriptions and customize lenses. We have set the bar for independent eyewear retailers since 2007 because of our unwavering belief in quality craftsmanship and attention to detail. Together with our eponymous collection, Silver Lining Opticians offers the best frames from the world to New York and beyond.",Commerce and Shopping,1,Jordan Silver,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
