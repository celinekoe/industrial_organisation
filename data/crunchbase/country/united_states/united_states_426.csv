We want to stir things up and create a minor revolution of sorts. We want to redesign how engineers conceptualize, design and develop a project. As key visionaries and builders in a ‘brave new world,’ engineers need tools that are equally ambitious. Engineers need tools that establish core project parameters and lay the groundwork seamlessly for more advanced analysis and conceptualization. Did we manage to pull it off? This is our story. In late 2010, a team of passionate and skilled civil engineers and software developers set out to make a difference in how engineers work. The mission was clear: How do we build engineering tools that help civil engineers work at an entirely new level of efficiency and accuracy? With feedback from working engineers and other professionals, we reconfigured and reimagined the segregated and expensive solutions of yesterday. The results are already apparent. CivilGEO’s engineering applications have made the engineering process more stream-lined, integrated and intuitive; professionals around the world have become converts and more are lining up to give our software a “go”. CivilGEO develops advanced engineering and environmental modeling software for civil engineers worldwide. Consulting engineering organizations, public utilities, government agencies, and educational universities rely on CivilGEO’s software to engineer, design and build the world’s infrastructure. Continuous research and development are key to our success; our software improves constantly to respond to the needs of working professionals and incorporate the most robust and necessary functionality. The result is that CivilGEO’s software empowers thousands of engineers to competitively plan, manage, design, operate, and sustain highly efficient and reliable infrastructure systems.

Motivated by what they saw in their practice, our parents set out on a mission to encourage sensible eating. They knew ingredients had to be nutritious and simple, that everything had to be delicious, and that their products needed to be super simple to make. While the world has changed since our little family business first got started, our focus remains true to our dads’ vision and we work every day to make them proud. Our history dates back to 1992 when our dads, medical partners and cardiothoracic surgeons, conducted emergency surgery to save a man’s life. They wound up also saving a business. After a successful operation, the group became friends. Later, the patient introduced our dads to the owner of Ungar’s Heimeshe Gefilte Fish Company. They were hooked. After acquiring the company (while keeping their busy medical practice) the pair launched Dr. Praeger’s Sensible Foods to provide nutritious, delicious, and convenient frozen foods.  The idea was to  offer food that tasted so good it’d be much easier to help people to adopt better eating habits.   Now, two decades later, the next generation is at the helm, inspired by and true to the original mission and values. We’re still an independent, family-owned and operated business grounded in using simple, whole ingredients to make great-tasting products families love. We’re continually working to expand our range of products to add new flavors and options that are as delicious to eat as they are easy to serve. We want to contribute to people’s ability to live their lives to the fullest!  The biggest impact we can make is by delivering the most delicious recipes made from simple, nutritious foods that help encourage good eating habits that last a lifetime.

In 2007, when YouTube was a shadow of its current self, Michelle Phan created her first makeup tutorial after receiving a job rejection from Lancôme.  Phan had been running a blog, Rice Bunny, where she shared makeup tips and expressed her love for the beauty industry. But one day, instead of writing a new article, she set up her webcam and recorded what may be YouTube’s first ever makeup tutorial. “I taught myself how to edit, and I decided to upload it to YouTube, not thinking anyone would watch it because who would watch this video? It’s not even that good,” Phan said in an interview with Alex Blumberg on the Without Fail podcast.  Within two weeks, her video had received 100,000 views and people were asking for more. So she made another video. And another one after that.  During what’s now referred to as the “golden age of YouTube” Michelle Phan found herself in the right place at the right time: on a burgeoning platform with plenty of room for growth.  After two Buzzfeed features in 2009 and 2010, Michelle Phan gained millions of subscribers and the traction she needed to launch brands of her own. In 2015, Phan launched EM Cosmetics as a L’Oreal line, only to buy all shares from L’Oreal in 2016.  Michelle Phan, the first makeup influencer on YouTube, is now a full-time CEO for one of the most distinguished makeup brands of our era.","Commerce and Shopping, Consumer Goods",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Zagat's Marketplace Survey also rated Bristol Farms as the number one market in overall quality and service; their stores were described as ""a shopper's beautiful dream with wide aisles, helpful staff, and beautiful presentations."" Bristol Farms was named after a street in West Los Angeles, and the word ""Farms"" was added to emphasize freshness, homemade quality and a warm glow of simple pleasures. The first store in Rolling Hills Estates is relatively small at only 17,800 square feet; it was followed four years later by a larger store in South Pasadena (22,500 square feet). The Manhattan Beach Bristol Farms, still larger at 33,900 square feet, opened in 1991 with a catering facility and cooking school. Bristol Farms opened a store in Ventura County at Westlake Village in November 1996. Bristol Farms entered the fast growing Orange County market during the summer of 1998 in Newport Beach. In June of 1999, their company acquired a small store that was a Hollywood landmark, Chalet Gourmet, and brought it into the Bristol Farms family. Soon after the opening of the Hollywood location, they opened a store in Westwood. In November of 2000, Bristol Farms opened a store at the site of the former Chasen's restaurant that serves the Beverly Hills and West Los Angeles areas. This location incorporates many of the design elements that made Chasen's a hallowed place in the lore of ""Old Hollywood"". 2006 brought another 40% growth in size and sales for Bristol Farms with the openings of thier Westchester, La Jolla, San Francisco and Palm Desert stores. In August of 2013, they opened the doors to their newest location in the community of Santa Monica. Each store has a unique and distinct feel designed to facilitate the communities they are in and have been great additions to the Bristol Farms family.","Commerce and Shopping, Community and Lifestyle, Food and Beverage, Sales and Marketing",,,5001-10000,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The new college’s faculty revolutionized medical education in this country by bringing the teaching of medicine to the hospital bedside, thus rejecting the idea that physicians should be trained exclusively in university lecture halls. Today, SUNY Downstate is one of the nation’s leading urban medical centers. SUNY Downstate comprises a College of Medicine, College of Health Related Professions, College of Nursing, School of Graduate Studies, School of Public Health, and University Hospital of Brooklyn. The quality of our education, research, and patient care programs was confirmed with the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Medicine to Dr. Robert Furchgott, a member of our School of Graduate Studies faculty since 1956. Dr. Furchgott’s identification of nitric oxide as a signalling molecule important in vascular health has revolutionized care for heart, stroke, impotence, and other diseases. As the only academic medical center in Brooklyn, they serve a large population–over 2.3 million people–and one that is among the most diverse in the world.

With 1Blocker, you’re safe online and nothing will distract you from enjoying sites. 1Blocker is very easy to use — just flip a couple of switches to start blocking ads and trackers. The app will automatically receive cloud updates to the built-in filters silently, so you don’t need to do anything. It’s as simple as setting and forgetting. 1Blocker is a fully native app designed to extend Safari naturally. It’s lightweight and doesn’t drain your battery by taking up your device’s resources. The blocking itself is super fast because Safari does it itself. We only provide filters to Safari and don’t modify webpages in any way. This vastly improves efficiency because Safari knows in advance what should be blocked. So, with 1Blocker, sites load on average 2-5x faster. It’s important to note that not all ads can be blocked though. Some sites use techniques that make it impossible for us to block their ads using currently available features for Safari content blockers. SECURE BY DESIGN 1Blocker is secure and private. It doesn’t have access to webpages and doesn’t track you in any way. We believe that privacy is not for sale. That's why we don't have an ""Acceptable Ads"" program. We stay independent, and the only way we make money is through direct sales of 1Blocker in the App Store to you. ADVANCED CUSTOMIZATION 1Blocker is a highly customizable content blocker, providing the possibility to create powerful custom rules. It allows you to create custom rules that block any URL by providing a regular expression or hide any element by CSS. It also lets you block cookies.

Your preferences and custom rules are always in sync through iCloud no matter which device you're using.

They are a leading producer in the Marcellus Shale and they conduct an active exploration program in the Utica Shale. Since their founding in 1860 and their first active mining operations in 1864, CONSOL has powered the nation with affordable, abundant, reliable domestic energy.

This facility was borne out of their core values - Safety, Compliance and Continuous Improvement - and enables us to identify opportunities and implement solutions that drive safety, production, and utilization of their strategic resources in smarter, more efficient ways. CONSOL Energy's coal mines are highly technical operating environments that require specialized training. The days of pick axes and shovels have been replaced with technologically advanced processes such as longwall mining, enhanced safety protocols, digital technologies and sophisticated communications technologies such as those employed at their centralized Communications Center at corporate headquarters. These advances have helped make the mining process safer and more productive, more than doubling resource recovery. CONSOL Energy's natural gas operations include coal bed methane extraction, conventional and shale gas exploration and production, all of which require expertise and technology that continues to evolve and advance. From safety to environmental protocols, techniques and equipment, advances in these areas are continuous, improving recovery, enhancing safety, and providing more environmentally protective methods.","Energy, Natural Resources",,,5001-10000,,IPO,,,,,,,,,,2,Public,1999-05-07,,,CEIX,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/consol-energy-ipo--e2867313,NYSE - New York Stock Exchange
