Using a simple blood sample to analyze RNA, Scipher Medicine can predict if a patient is likely to respond to a targeted therapy before therapy is prescribed. This insight allows patients to start the most effective therapy from day one. For its first commercial product, they have developed PrismRA®, a first-of-its-kind blood test that can predict which patients with rheumatoid arthritis are less likely to respond to TNFi therapies such as Humira® and Enbrel® so that such patients can go on alternative approved drugs.

Most patients who are prescribed blockbuster therapies today don't respond to treatment, costing the healthcare industry billions in wasted drugs while patients continue to suffer. Scipher's platform identifies which drug will work based on the patient's fundamental disease biology, and not based on symptoms, disease classification, or medical bias. A routine blood test predicts which drug he/she will respond to, with our first product focusing on rheumatoid arthritis, ensuring that the most optimal treatment is prescribed from day one.
