We've, implemented a novel, community based solution into our translation engine to address these problems. Whenever MeGlobe provides a translation that is incorrect, users have the ability to contribute and make edits to the translations themselves. These contributions are used to improve translation accuracy and quality. Every contribution made by the community allows MeGlobe to better account for colloquialisms, multiple word meanings, contextual influence or anything else that arises during natural conversations or the use of natural language patterns. This approach effectively introduces a human element to machine translation without sacrificing speed and autonomy and brings us one step closer to our dream of unifying the global online community.

Description: KnoFolio empowers aspiring artists to create a digital portfolio and share it with prestigious art & design colleges across the United States. KnoFolio offers portfolio development courses, constructive critique, and connection to the top art colleges in North America. Rationale: There are no meaningful online art college preparatory platforms despite a stated need from admission counselors and students. There are many websites that help students fulfill admissions criteria for traditional colleges and universities. The platforms usually take the form of ACT/SAT E-learning. The ACT/SAT is the key differentiator in a student’s application for traditional colleges and universities, whereas the portfolio is the key differentiator in a student’s application for an art college. KnoFolio will fill the demand for online portfolio development. It will be in a digital environment to free the student from the constraints of time and space. Students will have the ability to create a portfolio that meets the standards of art colleges without being hindered by economic or geographic constraints. Components: KnoFolio is broken into 4 components. These components reflect the essentials of a pre-college art program, and will provide the criteria to develop a meaningful body of work. •Portfolio Users will have the ability to upload their work, categorize it, and get it in front of The KnoFolio Community. •Critique The KnoFolio Community will provide meaningful critique on submitted work. •Development Courses Users will be offered many portfolio development courses that will help students create meaningful work that reflects what art colleges desire. •Art College Match Users will be able to browse accredited art & design colleges to find the best match for their artistic pursuits.","Education, Financial Services, Media and Entertainment, Sales and Marketing",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

We built Trackolade because we wanted to eliminate the costs of complexity that pervade ordinary project management software. We believe that simplicity is beautiful, that elegance trumps endless extras, and that ease-of-use is a measure of success. We looked long and hard at what features are really necessary and truly enhance productivity in a project management tool, and then we built that - and only that - into Trackolade. We think that flexibility and control are more valuable than having a stack of features, so we designed Trackolade to work the way effective teams work naturally - by making to-do lists, prioritizing through consensus, and collaborating constantly. We knew we were onto something when we started using Trackolade ourselves and our productivity, communication, and efficiency shot through the roof.  We decided to share Trackolade with the world because we know we’re not the only group of people working together towards a common goal who have experienced disorder, confusion and anarchy. We don’t have investors, we’re not huge risk takers, and we weren't incubated anywhere (unless you count our homemade office). We are simply a group of creators who want to produce the best work we can and have fun doing it - just like you.
