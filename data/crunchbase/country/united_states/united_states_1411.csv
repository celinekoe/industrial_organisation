And if you care about Bainbridge, you count on the Review for local news, opinion, sports and coverage of the arts. Tucked into the central Puget Sound, a half-hour by ferry from downtown Seattle, Bainbridge Island has made its share of history, from 19th century shipbuilding at Port Madison, to 20th century lumber milling at Port Blakely, to the crucial role the island's military installations served in winning the war in the Pacific during World War II. The Review has been there to cover it all, even making a little history of its own along the way as the only West Coast newspaper to defend the rights of Japanese-American citizens during the war. Today, with weekly publication as part of Kitsap Newspaper Group/Sound Publishing Inc., the Review is committed to keeping 20,000 islanders -- and, via the Internet, Their many friends and family members abroad -- up to date on this amazing little community around them. Annual special sections highlight local leaders and volunteers, women in business, scholars and athletes, and tourism destinations. If it happens on Bainbridge Island, we've got it covered. In fact, the Review earned first place for General Excellence in the 2001 and 2004 Washington Newspaper Publishers Association contest, and third place in 2002, 2003 and 2009 among newspapers with circulations of 5,001-9,000, besting 22 peer publications around the state. (But They like to think Their readers already knew that.) You can subscribe to the Review's print edition elsewhere on this site, or set a web browser bookmark at www.bainbridgereview.com.
