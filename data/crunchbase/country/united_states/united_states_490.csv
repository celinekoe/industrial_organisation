We are contracted to represent an impressive portfolio of industry leaders within the telecommunications and cellular industries. Many inquire about how we came to work with the names that we do, and the answer is two-fold. Firstly, we work with a broker that has over 20 years experience and is known as THE #1 outsourced marketing firm in the country. Their reputation has acquired the likes of clients that top the Fortune 500 list. After experiencing sub-par results from indirect marketing methods (billboards, radio ads, tv commercials, etc), big brands turned to our broker to handle all face to face customer acquisitions, and our broker turned to us. The second reason is Vatamanu Consulting's ability to incur all advertising, hiring, onboarding, and training costs to produce the best representation and results for our clientele! By increasing the number of new customers, retention, and satisfaction of existing customers, Vatamanu Consulting's clients have returned the favor by creating ample advancement opportunities for team members. With a clear and concise growth path, we look to train entry-level marketing and sales professionals into successful campaign managers. An emphasis on merit-based growth and advancement ensures our client is represented by the cream of the crop. Vatamanu Consulting proves that with the right team, training, and principles in place, rapid growth is possible. With our sights set on expanding into two additional cities in the next year, ambitious, competitive, and goal-oriented are three of the many adjectives we would use to describe our growing team.

Women are key to the development and prosperity of any society; Inspire believes that Muslim women are no different and are capable of being at the forefront of strengthening communities as well as tackling problems both within Britain and internationally. Inspire was founded in 2009 after its co-founders had spent over 15 years working within British Muslim communities. They were concerned that not enough was being done to challenge both gender discrimination and extremist ideologies within UK’s Muslim communities. Inspire was created to fill this void. Their  success lies in their ability to connect with women in grassroots communities and in shaping the debate more widely. They run campaigns, deliver conferences, workshops and programmes to women, statutory agencies and schools across the United Kingdom. They are regularly interviewed for local, national and international media. Inspire is a not for profit organisation. They are able to deliver projects through partnership work which in the past have included local authorities, community organisations, schools and police forces. They rely on donations and grants to keep the essential work of Inspire going.
