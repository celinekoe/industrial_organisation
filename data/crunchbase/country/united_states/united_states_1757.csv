Their major breakthrough is an efficient system to collect, relate, and analyze seemingly disparate client data; and then turn that data into actionable knowledge. Their professional services team helps their clients leverage this new insight to eliminate risks in their business operations. They were founded on the premise that companies with commercial fleets have mountains of data; about the people using the vehicle, about the vehicle, and if they have telematics devices, data about how the vehicle is being used. Even more data exists to run the business. Buried within this massive amount of data are insights about the business which can be discovered through analytics, pattern recognition, and predictive modeling. Once â€œminedâ€, this new-found knowledge will enable a business to understand past events, forecast future events, and take action or make decisions to change those future events to their advantage.

Bebaas is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel drug therapies utilizing its patent-pending cobalamin delivery mechanism.  The Company's research has led to the first-ever drug product capable of getting as much cobalamin, vitamin B12, into the bloodstream as an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12, and it maintains those levels longer than the injections. Additionally, it allows for cobalamin to be utilized as either a scavenger or a donor, leaving the door open to virtually limitless drug discovery. Bebaas is developing an internal product pipeline and lead compounds through the application of its proprietary cobalamin delivery technology.  The Company’s drug discovery platform, which has been validated in animal models, is based on the utilization of its patent-pending combinations of various vitamin B12 analogs that generate extremely high cobalamin levels. Numerous API can be added to the cobalamin delivery for oncology, hematology, cardiology, cyanide toxicity, wound healing and other therapeutic applications.  The basis for the research platform has led to the Company’s creation of the first completely non-invasive treatment for pernicious anemia, a cherry-flavored sublingual lozenge, CobacanTM, that has demonstrated in animal models to deliver a far more potent dose than the current standard of care, intramuscular injections of cobalamin.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Manufacturing, Science and Engineering",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

We are the only company of our kind that is dedicated to developing the SaaS business model and accelerating SaaS vendors' revenue generation. Our sole purpose is to drive scalable growth in service-focused enterprise software companies. The software industry's transformation to SaaS involves a fundamental shift in independent software vendors' (ISVs') position in their customers' value chain. ISVs no longer are merely application suppliers; they must become trusted advisors, delivering full-service solutions that integrate hardware, network, and software into seamless technology mechanisms that improve essential business processes and add valuable expertise. These differences require ISVs to change how they build, deploy, market, and sell; the starkly dissimilar revenue models mean ISVs need to adjust not only the way they recognize revenue but the speed and efficiency with which they generate it. Keychain Logic's customizable services are based on accepted best practices for technology service providers: Strategic Leadership: Successful SaaS deployments result from robust planning and visionary entrepreneurship. Keychain Logic's interim strategic leadership services provide a cross-functional view and executive-level expertise to companies that are evaluating, developing, launching, and growing their service-focused software business. Executive Search: In the exploding and highly competitive world of SaaS, the right sales & marketing people can mean the difference between an ISV's success or failure. Keychain Logic leverages its expertise and extensive network of industry professionals to identify highly qualified candidates. Incentive Compensation: Designed for subscription- and success-based recurring revenue models, Keychain Logic's high-performance sales compensation plans support the shorter SaaS sales cycle and encourage salespeople to aggressively hunt new business. Lead Generation: Integrating traditional brand marketing with highly cost-effective guerrilla tactics, Keychain Logic's lead generation programs deliver new high quality prospects and percolate them into â€œhotâ€ sales leads. Sales Cycle Management: Keychain Logic's tools and systems stress immediacy in funnel management and significantly shorten sales cycles while increasing closing ratios and allowing SaaS ISVs to serve more customers per account team.","Internet Services, Professional Services, Sales and Marketing, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
