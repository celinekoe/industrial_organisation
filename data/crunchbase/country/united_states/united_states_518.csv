When cancer cells respond to cancer drugs, they start their process of dying by changing weight in just a few hours. The SMR can detect this tiny weight change.  As most cancer cells die naturally within 1-2 days of being removed from the human body, speed is critical to distinguish between natural cell death and cell death induced by a cancer drug.  It is this exquisite sensitivity that enables the SMR to detect a cancer cell’s response to a cancer drug while it is still a viable cell.
