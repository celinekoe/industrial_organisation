The popularity of their services and unique business model has earned us recognition on the Inc. 500 list of the nation's fastest growing private companies.

Most have served at the C-Level or VP-Level in large firms, and most have managed P&L responsibility in customer engagement oriented roles including sales, marketing and service.

When they engage in projects, the teams they deploy are consistently much smaller and much more senior than those typically provided by other firms. Instead of their clients having to teach their consultants about their business, their consultants share insights with their clients about the most cost effective business strategies, implementation methodologies and management practices.
