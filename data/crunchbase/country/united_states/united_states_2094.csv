McClatchyDC's 40 journalists are part of the wider McClatchy family of news men and women who work in 15 states, 30 communities and on four continents. Their work appears on a variety of McClatchy's news products, from websites to mobile and tablet apps and on the printed pages of 31 separate newspapers. In all, more than 40 million people read McClatchy journalism each month. In addition, McClatchy's news is circulated to about 1,200 media clients worldwide by McClatchy-Tribune Information Services. The organization’s reporters independently cover news that is not partisan nor advocating any particular political group. The journalists in the Washington Bureau are a blend of those two companies. Although their offices are just a few blocks from the White House, they aim to cover Washington from an outside-the-Beltway perspective. Relying in part on McClatchy's newspapers, which extend from Miami to Anchorage, they report not just about the people who make the decisions in Washington, but the citizens of America, who must live with those decisions as well. McClatchy led the reporting on the politicization of the Justice Department under former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales in the US Attorney's scandal of 2007. Similarly, their journalists have done independent work on Goldman Sachs and the nation's financial collapse; on the Obama administration's insider threat investigations, on military justice, and on immigration; on China's human rights violations and the Syrian rebellion, the turmoil of the Arab Spring, and the recent Egyptian coup. McClatchyDC was founded during the gold rush days in California in the mid-19th Century. In 2006, McClatchy acquired the Knight Ridder, extending its reach across the United States and around the world.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment",1,James McClatchy,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

By using this hands-on approach, students remain motivated in their lessons and are much more likely to stick with their instruments for life.
