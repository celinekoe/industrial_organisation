More than 10 million people in the US suffer from memory loss, which can be caused by neurodegenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer's and dementia), brain injuries, stroke, heart attack, or the simple aging process.  BlipIQ's intuitive interface allows users to submit and tag memories in different formats (text, image, audio, and video). The application monitors and stimulates the patient's cognitive performance, which is reported to family, physicians, and insurers in order to improve quality of life, outcomes, and to reduce costs for all parties involved. As of 2017, 11% Americans over 65 have Alzheimer's, and this number is expected to increase every year due to the aging population. This degenerative condition often results in emotional and financial strain for the patient and their beloved ones, with devastating out-of-pocket costs of up to $56 billion for families and over $200 billion to insurers per year. The average cost of a long-term care facility is approximately $48,000 per year. Since a patient needing memory care can live up to 8 years in a facility, the potential expenses over that period may reach $384,000. In addition, today's Alzheimer medications vary in cost up to $4,800 per year.  BlipIQ's ultimate goal is threefold: To improve the quality of life for memory loss patients and their families by interacting and connecting them through the app, to improve the doctor's insights with enhanced reporting on patients, and to reduce the overwhelming costs for the families and insurers.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Biotechnology, Data and Analytics, Health Care, Science and Engineering, Software",1,Coy Gupta,1-10,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

From there, the two brought together the founding board of IT leaders from the likes of Bank of America, Fidelity Investments, JPMorgan Chase, UBS, and Gap Inc. Managed by Nick, the board worked together to create the first ONUG event, held on February 13, 2013 at the Fidelity Auditorium in Boston, Massachusetts. Today the ONUG Board has grown to include Bank of America, BNY Mellon, Cigna, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, FedEx, Fidelity, Gap, Inc., GE, Intuit, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Pfizer, UBS, Yahoo, and The Lippis Report. ONUG prides itself on being one of the only strictly user-based meetings. No press or vendors are invited to speak at or attend the morning conference sessions; therefore, speakers and attendance for the morning keynotes and panels are made up exclusively of IT executives and financial and industry analysts. Attendance for select afternoon sessions is open to all. The outstanding line-up of speakers at our events advocates the transition to open cloud infrastructure. At an ONUG event you can expect to hear keynotes from IT business leaders about their open networking and storage deployment experiences. They will share their motivations, results, and concerns so that other IT executives can make informed SDN deployment decisions within their own companies.

Using proven techniques and a flexible approach, the company's staff of Family Architects, Cognitive Companions, and Educationists are prepared for even the most chaotic conditions. The reality is that a lot of work goes into a functional family. Those who have mastered it may make it appear effortless, but this is an illusion. Cognition Builders shows clients what it means to make and achieve realistic goals, otherwise known as the essence of success. When those goals are met, it gives families and individuals the confidence they need to keep the momentum going. Cognition Builders works directly with people all over the world, using scientific tactics to affect real change. There are 2,000 programs in the Cognition Builders curricula, ranging from marital to academic. Each one applies logical principles to both small and major problems alike. Whether a family needs behavioral support for their child with autism, parents are going through a difficult divorce, or a person just wants to improve their eating habits, Cognition Builders can help. 90 percent of the Family Architects, Cognitive Companions, and Educationists have advanced degrees in varying fields in addition to hands-on experience. It makes for a comprehensive team that can meet nearly any need. Family Architects look at the family dynamics much like a CEO might assess their company’s daily operations. Cognitive Companions help adult clients make the most of their home and work life, and Educationists strive to change a student's entire learning philosophy. The reality is that families who trust and love one another are the foundation of society. A dysfunctional dynamic will only lead to broken relationships, both now and down the road. Yet it's all too easy to ignore these problems in the face of more immediate struggles. Cognition Builders teaches clients to look past the short term and see the bigger picture. The team can drill down into specific issues, such as difficult bedtime routines or after-school homework time, so families can spend their time working together instead of fighting. Life skills training can help everyone prioritize their emotional, physical, and mental health, regardless of their background. Many of the company's clients are titans of industry and want to be as successful at home as they are in their careers.",,1,Ilana Kukoff,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The Rita Allen Foundation Scholars program selected its first class of Scholars in 1976 as one of the first philanthropic fellowship programs of its kind for early-career biomedical scholars. The program grew out of a deep interest in improving human health, guided by input from leaders in biomedical research. With the Scholars program, the Foundation began what would become its defining approach to philanthropy: investing in the earliest stages of big ideas that have the power to be transformative. New resources allowed the Foundation to hire its first chief executive officer, Elizabeth Good Christopherson, and open its first office in 2009. In the years that followed, with the addition of new Board members and a strategic outlook, the Foundation continued to build on the Scholars program while expanding its venture philanthropy work to invest in innovative solutions to strengthen our democracy through civic literacy and engagement. Today, the intersection of science and democratic engagement is a promising new horizon—science requires robust public support to thrive, and it is, in turn, an essential element of solutions across society.","Financial Services, Professional Services",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Founded in 1998 as a response to the U.S. Treasury mandate that all Social Security and other Federal Benefit recipients receive their benefits by direct deposit, Skylight has become a viable option for many individuals to enter or reenter the banking system. Skylight focuses on specific markets that historically have been underserved by the banking industry. Skylight's target market consists of the unbanked individual as well as the companies that employ them. Generally, Skylight targets employers who have a high percentage and / or high number of low to moderate income, hourly employees. The unbanked population includes those who receive government benefits, payroll checks, and other types of payments, but currently have no banking relationship. Companies are seeking to move all employees to direct deposit as a means of providing additional employee benefits while reducing payroll costs and increasing employee productivity.
