We believe that everyone should have access to the comprehensive reputation scorecard of doctors so that they select the best healthcare providers available to them. ScoreDoc is a key tool for assisting patients in selecting the right healthcare provider. It is an easy-to-use, convenient information source that informs you about the quality of healthcare providers by analyzing online reviews on all major review platforms. Our reputation scorecard platform also employs artificial intelligence to provide medical groups or doctors online reputations, including analysis of sentiment expressed by patient reviews. If you are unsure which healthcare provider to select, enter the details of the physician or practice you are evaluating to generate their comprehensive reputation scorecard. The reputation scorecard will provide you with a percentile score to compare the prospective healthcare provider or practice with other providers in that specialty.","Health Care, Information Technology",2,"Ajay Prasad, Minu Prasad",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
