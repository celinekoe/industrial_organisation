This allows companies and organizations to invite their customers to follow their group on AgFuse. Any time the group page is updated, their followers receive a notification. It's a great way for organizations to interact with their customers and keep them informed. We have also recently unveiled AgFuse Publishing. This feature allows users and organizations to publish long form articles that can be shared with AgFuse users to help educate them and build the author's audience.
