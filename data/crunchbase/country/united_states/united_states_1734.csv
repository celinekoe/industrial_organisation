Formed to address the growing presence of big data and analytics in the high-stakes decision making process - we offer a suite of web based analytical tools to improve efficiency and accuracy.  A Decade In The Making  Following the 2003 closing of sports powerhouse Woolf Associates, our leadership formed Sports Identity, Inc. with the vision of building a traditional sports marketing firm that would pave the way for the emergence of BrandMatch Score.  In 2011, Empirical Synergies emerged and our premium offering, BrandMatch Score was launched in late 2012.  BrandMatch Score is a ground-breaking Market Research Tool that rates the compatibility between Brands & Endorsers.  Created to provide real-time analytical support and due diligence, brands are no longer forced to make subjective decisions based on syndicated, static data that has no direct correlation to their key attributes or objectives. With the philosophy that ""Moneyball"" can be applied to marketing, we're disrupting an industry and forcing marketers to change the way they hire endorsers. The software-based product conducts fully customized studies using Real-Time Consumer Insight & Career Performance data to quantify how well a celebrity matches a brand and campaign vision. BrandMatch Score removes subjectivity and mitigates the risk associated with hiring an endorser to represent a brand.  BrandMatch Score finally brings science to the art of identifying endorsers. There is now an objective tool to comprehensively measure compatibility and value.","Data and Analytics, Design, Other",2,"Derek Boyle, Josh Boyle",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The skyscraper, the Internet, the automobile, Tiger Woods, and the reverse cowgirl are only a few of his biggest successes. Well, today we can add one more to the list: FourPlay Football, the next evolution of friend leagues. Just like you, we were the first fantasy commissioners before your creepy neighbor and weird co-worker even knew about it.  A decade later we woke up and realized that we love the actual game of football and not just a few all-stars on each team. We like to feel the swings of the game, and we believe that 4th quarters are about rooting for a TEAM. To us, Fantasy Football has become a necessary evil, a fantastic social event which unfortunately consumes too much of our valuable time. We’ve all been there, spending countless hours to “research” how many receptions Kansas City allows to TEs on the road.  Sometimes, despite our efforts, we are obliterated by an untimely turf toe, unforeseen DUI, or Tom Brady’s left knee…in the first game of the season…when we drafted him with the #1 overall pick…F*#kkk! FourPlay Football is a game where YOU control your own destiny. Maybe that’s why we are hearing whispers from our underground users (almost blasphemously) stating, “I like it better than Fantasy.” Cheers, Team FourPlay","Apps, Gaming, Software, Sports",1,Jeffrey Johnson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
