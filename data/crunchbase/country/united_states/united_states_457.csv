Despite best intentions, many communities find themselves unable to effectively digitize their utility, translating into continued operational inefficiencies, less visibility into asset health & system risks, and an inability to efficiently report key metrics to government, regulators, and ratepayers. Benefits are widely understood, and solutions, of course, exist; however, the way ‘digital water’ is being packaged and sold to smaller utilities is, in fact, the barrier to utility modernization.  The net result of stalled digitization is increased public health, safety, and environmental risks. WaterClick recognized that the way to accelerate utility modernization is NOT to lecture utilities about the benefits of digitization, rather, offer them a digital solution that meets their unique budget and operational needs.  We operate a platform that streamlines the onboarding of digital tools, offers pre-configured integrations, and delivers a cloud-based dashboard and support desk, all via a subscription model.  At the core of this ‘Platform as a Service’ (PaaS) business model is WaterClick’s proprietary ‘Click-in’ integration, which allows smaller utility operators to benefit from recent innovations in sensing, analytics, and decision support software that the larger utilities are already using; however, with WaterClick operators can simply add/remove features that meet their needs and budget.  And for technology companies with innovative ‘digital water’ solutions, WaterClick is now an effective path to customer.

As a result, IBS bank software solutions have been licensed to almost 900 financial institutions nationwide. As a privately held NH corporation, IBS is afforded the luxury of staying explicitly focused on long term collection and recovery automation success, lacking varying pressures of venture capitalists, outside industry funding sources or external/public stockholders. IBS practices what is fast becoming the long lost art of defining long term successful strategies, and doing what is long term best for the client, thus for IBS. IBS does not get distracted from its central mission and purpose of providing the most dynamic, targeted bank software solutions. This focus ensures that IBS clients will reap the short and long-term benefits of having a dedicated business partner with a clear focus only to improve and enhance their collection and recovery technology. Partner is not a term bantered loosely at IBS. Partner applies to our clients, to our employees, to our relationship channels (whether ""channels"" are core servicing system providers, or collection industry specific solution providers). A strong partner culture combined with an explicit focus yields client driven enhancements such as a further refined user interface for more power yet simpler use, an integrated suite of voice messaging options including a predictive dialer (software as a service – so no telephone hardware or software must be purchased, installed or maintained), full integration with the complete set of LexisNexis batch products, or accepting checks and debit cards via telephone. A goal of every new release is balancing 1/3 of change driven by clients, defining their use needs, 1/3 based on IBS Marketing and Sales team input as seen and heard from market driven needs outside of our client base, and 1/3 from our product development team – to ensure the systems foundation stays contemporary.
