Scrambls works on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, Yammer, and many other top sites. Scrambls empowers users to protect the messages they post to the web and social networking sites. It’s a simple, yet secure web browser plug-in that gives everyone the ability to share private communications across social networks. Whether your concern is privacy, copyright, disclosure or posterity, scrambls provides users with the ability to maintain ownership of access to the material they post into social media infrastructures on the web.  With scrambls, you decide how your content is shared, and keep full control over the statements and information that you post to social networks or anywhere online. Share with your own groups of friends and colleagues, effectively choosing a single personal privacy and publication policy that applies to all websites and social networks that you interact with. Advanced features even allow you to make decisions such as choosing the time a post will appear; to set an expiration date; or even to publish only to people in a certain geographic region or time zone. Today using sites like Twitter and Facebook means giving away your content. If you post something and then change your mind it’s too late, it’s out there forever. With scrambls, you can change your mind and take it back, simply by changing the groups or individuals permitted to read your comments. Retain ownership of your intellectual property, by uploading scrambled content to the web, for which you alone can share who the keys are shared with, changing permissions anytime you wish. And scrambls is particularly important for protecting children online, ensuring others can’t observe conversations, and keeping what kids say online today, from entering archives where they’ll remain visible forever.
