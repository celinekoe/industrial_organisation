Though unconfirmed, it is expected to release the second array of its one-of-a-kind products in late December 2012. The move to focus on web security was mainly influenced by the recent web infiltration witnessed in countries such as the numerous ongoing multibillion dollar criminal botnet activities, powergrid tampering by cyber-criminals and inconcieavable disruption of corporate networks.
