When Houston was founded in 1836, Jews were among the first to make this city their home. Finally, in 1908, when Houston’s population was around 75,000, the Texas Jewish Herald (later, the Jewish Herald-Voice) became the first subscription weekly newspaper for its 1,000-member Jewish community. Today’s Jewish Herald-Voice is nationally recognized by journalists around the country for its award-winning articles and columns. Independently owned and now more than 107 years old, the Herald-Voice covers international, national and local news that enriches the lives of Houston and Texas Gulf Coast Jewish residents. In addition, business owners, government officials and clergy of other faiths subscribe to the Herald to be informed on Jewish issues and to keep up with their Jewish customers and friends. The Jewish Herald-Voice empowers its readers to action through its reporting of important events, community happenings and life-cycle announcements; editorials and insightful columns and coverage of a wide variety of issues for people of all ages and stages. Representing the great and powerful diversity of this Jewish community, the Herald unites many thoughts in its weekly pages. As one of American’s original chat rooms, this Jewish community newspaper is an interactive forum that brings people together, rather than divides and separates.  Besides delivering a quality newspaper to its paid subscribers every Thursday, the Jewish Herald also publishes plus five annual magazines – for Passover, Rosh Hashanah, Wedding Planner, Bar/Bat Mitzvah Planner and “VOICES in Houston,” a magazine for Jewish living.  The longest-running Jewish newspaper in the Southwest and one of the oldest in the United States, the Jewish Herald-Voice reveals more about Houston and Texas Jewish life, thought and culture than any other single source. Charged with being THE VOICE of the greater Houston Jewish community, the Herald is the perfect medium for businesses to advertise their message to its well-known responsive audience of consumers.","Community and Lifestyle, Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
