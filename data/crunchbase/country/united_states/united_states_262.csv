Both products were developed in response to the need for quick and reliable access to information for planning and emergency purposes. Basic functionality is divided into 3 areas:  1) The virtual vault. Files are preserved in a secure remote location. Almost any file format is accepted including images, audio, and video. For security reasons, any attempt to upload system files and executables (i.e. exe, vbs, etcâ€¦) is rejected.  2) Planning and Organization. Materials are organized with an easy-to-use interface covering over 50 topic areas including income, expenses, belongings, family members, digital assets, and final affairs. Information is aggregated into a PDF file with a single mouse click.  3) Collaboration. Information is shared on a need-to-know basis as independent slices of information. For example, an accountant needs to access tax returns. An attorney needs to access legal documents. A physician needs to access medical directives. These collaborators, known as Corporate Partners, have limited role-based file sharing abilities through dedicated shared folders.
