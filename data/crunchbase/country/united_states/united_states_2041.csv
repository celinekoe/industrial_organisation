We have developed solutions for our customers for the past 50 years. Today our divisions are capable of fulfilling almost any need a business may have. Our customers work in every industry imaginable – distribution, healthcare, education, legal, engineering, manufacturing, and more. Indoff is not a traditional business where we warehouse large quantities of product. We maintain relationships with hundreds of manufacturers, wholesalers, and service providers so that we can find the right product for any situation. We will not try and sell you a product simply because it is what “happens to be in stock.” Our Partners work to make sure that what you need is based on your requirements and not ours. We combine the financial strength of a $175 million-plus distributor with the talents, expertise, and local service of hundreds of sales professionals. Our Sales Partners are indeed our Partners – they are empowered to manage their relationships and make local decisions regarding pricing and product selection. Their experience and talents are backed by our administrative and technological expertise that drives customer satisfaction.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Information Technology",,,251-500,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
