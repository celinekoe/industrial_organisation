In October 1999, the Euro-Peds® clinic opened as part of the non-profit hospital, North Oakland Medical Centers (NOMC) in Pontiac, Michigan.  Physical therapists that specialized in this unique therapy were hired, and the program took off immediately. While originally focusing on the treatment of children with cerebral palsy, the clinic has evolved to successfully treat children with a variety of special needs such as Traumatic Brain Injuries, Spina Bifida, Down Syndrome and a wide variety of other non-progressive neuromuscular disorders.  In 2008, NOMC was purchased by Doctors' Hospital of Michigan (DHM), a Joint Commission accredited acute-care hospital.  For the next five years, Euro-Peds continued to provide top-notch service as part of DHM.  In August 2013, Euro-Peds® became an independent specialty center- still leasing space from DHM, but as a separate entity. The center continues treating children and young adults with neuromuscular disorders in its original location in Pontiac, Michigan.  To date over 1100 children and young adults have benefited from this unique therapy at Euro-Peds® and have gained hundreds of new skills including better head control, learning to roll, sit up, transfer, and to take their first steps.","Health Care, Other, Social Impact",,,101-250,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
