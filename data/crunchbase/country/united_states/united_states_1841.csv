Bank executives have an incredibly difficult job. Burdensome regulation; economic, political and market volatility; restrictive credit; recruiting and retaining executive staff; opportunities to generate other types of income; portfolio, credit and duration risk management; and cyber security risk are just a few of the challenges bank leaders are facing. All of these challenges are coupled with the expectation to deliver superior results to shareholders, board of directors and all stakeholders.  Most middle market banks do not have the financial resources available to pay high-end experts to assist them through the challenging and risky seas through which bank C officers are required to navigate. Just like a ship’s captain has a boatswain available to help the ship achieve its mission, the bank captain has the BankBosun available to help the bank achieve its mission. BankBosun interviews leading experts located throughout the country in all areas of risk and opportunity impacting the banking industry, collecting strategies and tactics to help banks navigate risk and discover reward in this ecosystem.  BankBosun offers no-cost audio podcasts, video content and print media for busy professionals operating and succeeding in the banking ecosystem, providing them the opportunity to make efficient use of time to increase knowledge and awareness of issues and solutions that effect the banking industry.","Financial Services, Information Technology",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
