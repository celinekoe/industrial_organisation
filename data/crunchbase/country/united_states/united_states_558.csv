In addition to the software platform, Bon Harvest offers its farming customers with the option to receive immediate payments on their shipped orders, as most farmers end up waiting weeks to be paid on fulfilled orders.  Founded in 2016, Bon Harvest initially started as a food distributor in New York City, specializing in the distribution of ""ugly produce."" However, after three years of working alongside 70 farms and 30 different restaurants, a more pressing and unaddressed problem revealed itself: farmers and chefs don't have a consistent or reliable way to interact over produce availability, and for the most part, get by using emailed Excel spreadsheets. This inefficient method of communication has a few consequences for both sides: wasted food, wasted time, and perhaps more importantly, a wasted opportunity to leverage data that could be used to improve business operations.","Agriculture and Farming, Food and Beverage, Software",2,"Teymour El Derini, Will Reich",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

We were a group of friends and real estate investors who wanted to do well with our properties, acquiring and renting them out. We had no idea that this ambition would later grow to become Ofirio. As we invested in real estate ourselves, we ran into a big problem: we realized just how extremely time consuming and complicated it was to find a good deal. We were using several separate tools and keeping track of all of the research with spreadsheets. We knew there was a better way! As the saying goes, “if you want it done right, you gotta do it yourself” - and so we built the most comprehensive set of real estate investment tools that are backed by real-time data and artificial intelligence - everything we desperately wished we had during all those years of research. Now we bring these tools to you, to help you save your time, invest smarter, and grow your wealth quicker.","Financial Services, Real Estate",1,Nick Polushkin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
