We want a system which respects the individual and encourages us to discover the best within ourselves and develop our full potential. Principled; Consistent The Libertarian way is a logically consistent approach to politics based on the moral principle of self-ownership. Each individual has the right to control his or her own body, action, speech, and property. Government's only role is to help individuals defend themselves from force and fraud. Accepting The Libertarian Party is for all who don't want to push other people around and don't want to be pushed around themselves. Live and let live is the Libertarian way. AMERICA'S THIRD LARGEST PARTY The Libertarian Party is America's third largest and fastest growing political party. Libertarians engage in a variety of projects, working for everyone's liberty on every issue. The Libertarian Party was created in December of 1971 by people who realized that the politicians had strayed from America's original libertarian foundation, with disastrous results. Their vision was the same as that of America's founders -- a world where individuals are free to follow their own dreams in their own ways, a world of peace, harmony, opportunity, and abundance. Libertarians are practical; we know we can't make the world perfect, but, it can be better. Libertarians will keep working to create a better, freer society for everyone. As William Allen White said: ""Liberty is the only thing you cannot have unless you are willing to give it to others."" WHY NOT STICK WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT? ""Given the low level of competence among politicians, every American should become a Libertarian."" -- Charley Reese, Alameda Times-Star (California), June 17, 2003 The politicians in Washington and our state capitals have led us away from the principles of individual liberty and personal responsibility which are the only sound foundation for a just, humane, and abundant society. Government at all levels is too large, too expensive, woefully inefficient, arrogant, intrusive, and downright dangerous. Democratic and Republican politicians have created the status quo and do not intend to change it. CONSIDER THE LIBERTARIAN OPTION Substantially reduce the size and intrusiveness of government and cut all taxes. Let peaceful, honest people offer their goods and services to willing consumers without a hassle from government. Let peaceful, honest people decide for themselves what to eat, drink, read, or smoke and how to dress, medicate themselves, or make love, without fear of criminal penalties. The U.S. government should defend Americans and their property in America and let the U.S. taxpayer off the hook for the defense bill of wealthy countries like Germany and Japan. WHAT AMERICANS WANT Americans want, and deserve, a political system which respects them as unique individuals; as people who can make their own plans, who can take responsibility for themselves, who are compassionate, and who can and will solve their own problems if allowed to do so. Most Americans, after some thought, prefer the Libertarian option in politics. Most people in their private, non-governmental, affairs deal with each other on the libertarian premise of mutual respect. You don't threaten your neighbors with fines or jail just because they choose careers or lifestyles different than yours. Let's hold government to the same standard. Protect us and our rights, and give us the respect we deserve. TIME FOR ACTION We hope you can see the benefits of living in that America envisioned by the founders and by their political heirs, today's Libertarians. We hope you will want to join the Libertarian Party and become involved in our many activities at the national, state, and local levels. Are you ready for a change in American politics? For as long as most of us can remember, Republican and Democratic politicians have talked about solving the problems that face Americans; but their ""solutions"" have only worsened the situation -- higher and higher taxes; greater intrusions into our personal lives; more rapes, murders, and muggings; and a crumbling public school system graduating fewer and fewer people who can read. We believe the American people -- like their counterparts in Eastern Europe -- have seen through the charade of big government. We believe the American people are ready for a fresh approach to the problems that plague us. Libertarian ideas were instrumental in the birth of our country, and they can inspire a return to the individual initiative, responsibility, and prosperity that were once part of the American dream. If you agree, we hope you will join us.","Community and Lifestyle, Government and Military, Other, Social Impact",,,10001+,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

First, consumers often regret their purchases. 20-40% of vouchers go unused and many more are only used because they must be in order to capture the sunk cost.  Second, consumers often miss out on the opportunity to buy a particular voucher because of the nature of the flash sale timing.

The member companies buy and sell products and services to each other using an internal currency known as barter or trade dollars. Modern barter has evolved considerably with the advancement of the internet to become an effective method of increasing sales, conserving cash, moving inventory, and making use of excess production capacity for businesses around the world. Businesses barter to earn trade credits (instead of cash) that are deposited into their account. They then have the ability to purchase goods and services from other members utilizing their trade credits – they are not obligated to purchase from who they sold to, and vice-versa. ABE plays an important role because of the record-keeping, brokering expertise and monthly statements to each member. ABE makes money by charging a commission on each transaction.   Modern trade and barter has developed into a sophisticated tool to help businesses increase their efficiencies by monetizing their unused capacities and excess inventories. The worldwide organized barter exchange and trade industry has grown to an $8 billion a year industry and is used by thousands of businesses and individuals. The advents of the Internet and sophisticated relational database software programs have further advanced the barter industry’s growth.
