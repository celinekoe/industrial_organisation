You need the experienced Colorado criminal attorneys of WeedenLaw. We can help to answer the tough questions for you and hold your hand through the process. Could you be fired from your job? Lose your driver’s license? Be prevented from obtaining certain kinds of professional certifications? Have to give up your firearms? Get hit with high fines? Languish in jail or prison? Even after you supposedly pay back your debt to society, a criminal conviction will stick with you in the form of a criminal record that can make it more difficult for you to get a job, find a place to live, secure a loan, and more. The best way to protect your future? Fight back. Since 2005, founder Jeffrey L.
