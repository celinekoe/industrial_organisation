Making a difference."" About55 has over 1,200 members who are discovering the resources they need for mid-life self-renewal, and we are just getting started! Our model has several revenue channels, is inherently social, solves a big and recurring consumer need, and is aimed at dominating a mid-life self-renewal market which is dramatically under-served by the competition. Where We Came From About55 was created from the observation of two colliding trends. the rise in economic stress among those in mid-life and the rapid adoption of social media among those in this same group. Many of the current problems being experienced by those in mid-life are clearly visible, such as foreclosure and unemployment. But many of the real symptoms brought on by these events are often hidden and not discussed because those involved are often embarrassed and are caught off-guard by their current situation. To add to their stress, many have also lost much of their peer support because their circle of friends were broken due to these same circumstances. This loss of support and the resulting loneliness has added additional stress to their lives. So, how are these problems brought to the forefront of discussion and resolved? About55 provides a community of peers, expert support and the tools needed to unlock the talents and skills possessed by our membership. A place for our members to grow, explore, renew and celebrate their accomplishments. The formula for self-renewal is proven. The Well-known psychological theorist, Carl Jung, suggest that ""the successful resolution of mid-life problems either comes from an increase in self-growth, a new vocation, or often both"". Our business niche is to facilitate the delivery of the products and services needed for self-renewal via social marketplace and knowledge sharing platform.   Why We Will Succeed About55 has the right focus at exactly the right time. We bring together and match the needs of our members who are seeking self-renewal resources with experts who can deliver career, life, and relationship coaching. Our solution is a social marketplace that fulfills both the needs of the buyer and the targeted audience sought by the sellers.","Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Professional Services",1,Dennis Carpenter,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The clinic was founded in 2004 by NP Egan, who famously authored a health column for more than a decade before the rise of the digital news age. Her 2003 article about Vitamin D3 was the world's first publicly consumable piece of news media on the subject, and revolutionized the world's understanding of vitamin D. Prior to the debut of that article, ergocalciferol, or vitamin D2, was the form of the nutrient most commonly found in food and supplements. That has all changed, and D2 is now virtually unheard of, thanks largely in part to NP Egan's article debunking the theory that the two forms were equals - a claim that numerous scientific studies have since confirmed. This is relevant as vitamin D3 has been shown to help prevent over 50 chronic diseases, illnesses and other health maladies. The clinic focuses on women's health, anti-aging medicine, personalized nutrition and skin care, however NP Egan does accept male patients. It has grown so large that she had to discontinue her column for the St. Tammany News, and now blogs whenever time permits.

Our vision of financial success is made possible by combining small efforts of a large group of people with the help of reliable technology. In the words of John D. Rockefeller's, “I would rather earn 1% off a 100 people's efforts than 100% of my own efforts”. The main question that made us design Solomon Mines was how to make your savings grow in a safe and fast way, along with that, how to make savings work and earn extra income in a low-risk environment. Based on the extensive financial trading experience of our founders, we came up with a solution: invest your money in gold and make it work through networking.  Traditionally, gold has been considered a conservative financial instrument. In the context of extreme stock market volatility, the benefits of the physical gold market have become more and more lucrative.  We chose gold because it's a safe way to keep your savings. We believe that networking is the best way to build up your business. Our Referral Rewards Program puts your savings to work for you, making gold a profitable financial tool accessible to everyone. One can purchase as little as 2 ounces of gold to qualify for entry into the program. And by referring new members, you get a commission from the investments of your members.  We chose a Referral Rewards Program because it’s a fast way to generate more income. Solomon Mines is a safe and fast way to earn more money.",Financial Services,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
