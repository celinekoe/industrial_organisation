Many, if not most, junior explorers and miners fail at the precise moment of greatest opportunity—after the discovery of a significant resource. GoldKey acquires or joint ventures with junior mining companies that have already taken the risk of greenfield exploration and identified promising prospects, but may be unable to bring a project to market or into production. GoldKey evaluates these prospects, completes geological work if necessary, analyzes the provenance/validity of mineral licenses and concession agreements, and then prepares properties for sale or trade to mid-tier or major mining companies, or enters into joint venture partnerships.  Old Hands, New Ideas GoldKey’s geographical area of specialization is Africa, particularly West Africa. West Africa is perhaps the most prospective gold region in the world. GoldKey has an extraordinarily seasoned team of exploration and mining professionals, investment and merchant bankers, fund managers, political and security analysts, and contract negotiators. The GoldKey team has owned, managed, bought and sold mines and mineral properties in Africa, advised private and public companies and sovereign governments. Investors will not pay for anyone’s apprenticeship. The company's approach is new but its principals are old hands, with insight gained the hard way, over time and in the real world. This is a unique opportunity to participate in a new paradigm for resource development that is practical, timely, in-demand, market-focused, and fiscally conservative.","Manufacturing, Natural Resources, Sustainability",,,11-50,1,,35000,USD,35000,35000,USD,35000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

In 1963, the name was officially changed to Federal Electronics. As the contract manufacturing industry continued to evolve and mature, so too did Federal Electronics. Over the years, with a growing customer base in the instrumentation, industrial, and military markets, Federal expanded its service offerings to include fiber optic interconnects, printed circuit board assemblies, box builds, higher level assemblies, and systems integration. In particular, Federal specializes in flexible, scalable electronic contract manufacturing. Today, Federal Electronics is a multi-national, vertically-integrated Electronic Manufacturing Services (EMS) provider with facilities in Cranston, RI, and Hermosillo, Sonora Mexico.  As a Rhode Island manufacturer, Federal focuses on the challenging requirements found within the low-to-mid volume, higher mix and higher complexity applications in the defense/aerospace, life science/medical, test/instrumentation, and industrial capital equipment markets, with a particular concentration in “difficult to outsource” projects.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Manufacturing",1,Romolo Evangelista,101-250,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
