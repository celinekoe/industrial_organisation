CARE is devoted to educating the public about the need to guarantee our access to the affordable energy that drives our nation forward. CARE is not affiliated with a political party. In the years ahead we'll need to greatly increase our electricity supply. While it is important to continue to develop renewable energy sources, they are not likely to be nearly enough to meet the growing demand. Coal is still a great resource and clean coal technology is rapidly becoming a reality. After a dormancy of nearly 30 years, it's time to bring back nuclear power, which is safe and clean. Anti-development and anti-energy activist groups are attempting to deceive the public into believing that we can wean ourselves off of oil in the near future. Perhaps in the decades ahead that worthy goal will be realized, but in the meantime there is no viable substitute for petroleum--the most powerful and versatile fuel known to man. The United States cannot lose its ability to produce a significant percentage of oil for itself. Without enough petroleum, freedom itself could be in jeopardy. Of course, as important as energy is to our survival and prosperity, we must also demand that energy production does not put undue stress on our environment.

The goal of this merger was to create a larger unified geographically diverse practice organization that would provide the opportunities to improve the delivery and quality of cardiovascular care to their patients. Specifically, they wanted to have a group large enough to support the subspecialty expertise and program development that would provide a level of care previously unavailable in their region. Over the past 16 years, the results of this endeavor have exceeded even their most optimistic initial projections. They have grown in size from their initial 17 founding partners to 40 cardiovascular physicians and surgeons. They have initiated subspecialty programs in cardiac electrophysiology (arrhythmias and pacemaker devices), coronary intervention (angioplasty and stents), peripheral vascular disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac surgery, and advanced cardiac imaging. These programs are not only the largest and most comprehensive physician-group based subspecialty programs in their area, but have each introduced many previously unavailable cutting edge technological advances in the diagnosis and treatment of heart disease. Each of these subspecialty sections of their group has achieved national and international recognition for their contributions to new clinical knowledge and to the evaluation of new techniques. Through their relationship with the Lindner Center for Clinical Research, they are able to bring to their patients the newest and most promising treatment modalities well before they are available to the general public. They are one of the few groups in the country to have incorporated high quality cardiovascular surgeons so that the full range of cardiac treatment modalities can be offered to their patients “under one roof” facilitating the most appropriate treatment decisions for each patient. Their growth as a physician organization has come largely from their ability to recruit some of the finest young medical talent from the premier training programs, from all over the country. They have been attracted by the unique practice and subspecialty opportunities that can only be offered by a group of their size and scope. Many have brought with them new skills and innovations that had not previously been available in their community. By increasing their size, they have also been able to provide more comprehensive care to the many geographically diverse areas they serve by providing as much care as possible in offices close to the patients’ own community. They strive to maintain a compassionate and personal doctor-patient relationship while simultaneously providing the patient easy access to their subspecialty services. They currently have offices in eighteen communities and are integrally involved with nine hospital systems in the Southern Ohio and Southeastern Indiana regions. By working closely with these local and regional hospital systems, they strive to provide the most technologically advanced care in the most convenient, accessible, and seamless way possible. None of this would be possible without their incredibly talented and dedicated non-physician medical and administrative staff of over 225 employees. Their size and organization have allowed us to recruit and maintain the best people available and their skill and caring greatly facilitate their physicians’ ability to deliver the best cardiovascular care in the most efficient manner possible. The Ohio Heart and Vascular Center, Inc. is proud to serve the cardiovascular needs of the Greater Cincinnati area. They are also proud of the many innovations, skilled personnel, and organizational benefits they have contributed to their community over the past 16 years. They pledge to continue in their mission to provide the most technologically advanced and effective care to the greatest number of people in the most easily accessible and caring environment possible.",Health Care,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

ACP members invest their time, talent, and money in supporting companies with solid business models and their efforts to grow successfully. Angel financing is the lifeblood of growing companies. Ansel Capital Partners organizes the resources of the angels by streamlining the deal flow. We present monthly reviews of two targeted, prescreened companies that are matched to investor's interests. Each month we target one of the three investment types: Medical devices, Health care services, and Healthcare IT. Materials are summarized and distributed prior to each meeting.
