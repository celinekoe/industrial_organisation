The primary objective of Danger Room Gaming is to enter the Internet marketplace with top-of-the-line marketing, sales, organization, security and innovation to maximize the Company’s success. Danger Room Gaming, B.V., a Curacao private limited company with its registered office in the country of Curacao (“Danger Room Gaming”), has developed and owns the trivia gaming software engine that enables i) Danger Room’s wager-based trivia game Rapid Fire Trivia running real-time on the Internet; ii) white label versions of the wagering game; iii) Free and theme based trivia games owned by Danger Room Gaming. The wagering trivia game is licensed as a skill game, features real money wagering, is multi-player, allows unlimited users to wager on each question and distributes the “pot” equally to all players answering correctly. Rapid Fire Trivia and white label versions also have a progressive, slot-style jackpot allowing for payouts when the required percentage of players answers a question correctly. Users can choose from hundreds of categories, with varying wager amounts, running 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Danger Room Gaming’s primary revenue streams are commissions from wagering, referral fees from bonus points (MyComps SM), margin on the redemption of MyComps for merchandise, and fees from cash out transactions. In May 2011, Danger Room Gaming was issued a gaming sub-license through Cyberluck Curacao N.V. from the government of Curacao for the operation of games of skill and games of chance. Rapid Fire Trivia integrates a player referral program which provides all players the opportunity to earn money though our MyCompsSM for promoting the game. Users are able to access real-time earnings statistics in their account. The game provides tools, links, banners and tutorials to help players earn money by referring other players. Users are encouraged to use friends and support while playing the game to earn the maximum amount of points and chances to win big jackpots. The Company’s strengths and milestones include:  * The Company does not have any significant non-convertible debt.  * Danger Room Gaming has been issued a gaming license for games of skill and games of chance.  * The Rapid Fire Trivia game has been statistically tested by a University of Chicago expert concluding that Rapid Fire Trivia is a game where skill is the predominant factor.  * The trivia games are tested, complete and the file size is very light, which enables them to be played on nearly any browser enabled device including smart phones, mobile devices and mobile computers with high speed Internet connectivity.  * The trivia games do not restrict the number of players who can play simultaneously.  * The Company’s operating costs will decline as a percentage of game revenue as gaming volume increases.  * Prepared to launch Rapid Fire Trivia (the wagering trivia game), with deposit / cash out functionality through Merchant Processor.  * Developed the My Comps Rewards SM redemption program for bonus points earned for play and referrals in both Rapid Fire Trivia and Free Trivia Game. This is also an incremental revenue stream.  * Obtained a legal opinion from Lewis and Roca, a noted Las Vegas law firm specializing in gaming law, and a University of Chicago expert’s statistical analysis that Rapid Fire Trivia is a game where skill is the predominant factor.  * Have a staff of approximately 5 full time equivalents.  * Actively pursuing over 10 white label domestic and international opportunities.  * Retained a top gaming design firm in Las Vegas, Nevada to redesign the human factors and human interface to the games focusing on player excitement, satisfaction and retention.  The software engine underlying Rapid Fire Trivia, and all of our trivia games, has a unique feature; it operates on the Internet without requiring a downloaded application. If a user has access to the Internet, the game can be played. This opens the door to play on a multitude of web enabled platforms including mobile devices, cell phones, I Pads and equivalent devices. Danger Room Gaming was formed as a private limited company in Curacao within the Netherlands Antilles. On October 10, 2010, Curacao became an independent constituent state within the Kingdom of the Netherlands.","Commerce and Shopping, Gaming, Internet Services",2,"Derek J.
