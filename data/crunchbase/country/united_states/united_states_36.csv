The process involves noninvasive brain stimulation using light and sound, to replicate a desired mental state. Examples of desirable states include the states of flow, hyper-focus, relaxation, sleep, etc. The results of the initial pilot studies were positive and have been presented and published. The company’s initial go-to-market focuses on sleep in general, and the treatment of insomnia and other sleep disorders in particular. This represents a $3.5 Billion sub-segment of the half-trillion-dollar global sleep economy. We believe our technology has far-ranging medical applications beyond sleep, including dementia, depression, anxiety/PTSD, phobias, and ADHD.
