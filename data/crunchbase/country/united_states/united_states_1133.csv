Lenses can be about anything, such as ideas, people or places, hobbies and sports, pets or products, philosophy, and politics. Lenses aren't primarily intended to hold content; more emphasis is placed on recommending and then pointing to content on the web.  Users who create lenses are called lensmasters. A lensmaster uses the tools available online to provide links, feeds, abstracts, and lists to users who are trying to make sense of a topic. For example, a single lens could point to Flickr photos, Google maps, blogs, eBay auctions, YouTube videos, and other links. Lensmasters are encouraged to promote personal agendas, expertise, causes, products, and opinions.

What if instead of coming to a doctor, a doctor will come to you? There are already doctors doing home calls, but still most of the primary care is provided in clinics, since medical equipment and laboratory are not portable. Digital era changes the game. With point-of-care diagnostics, secure cloud data-bases and telemedicine we can make doctor’s office portable.  Miniaturization of diagnostic and laboratory devices along with telecommunication helps to avoid travel, waiting and exposure to other patient’s pathogens by replacing the unnecessary ER/Urgent care visits with a professional care in the comfort of patient’s home. Mobile Office Point-of-Care lab ensures hospital quality rapid blood, and urine testing 24/7 along with instrumental tests and on-line consultations’ by specialists. We enable family doctors to continuously serve their patients - after hours, during weekends and travel time.  The key elements are: ·      Care in the comfort of patients’ home (nurse house call visits within 1.5 hour after a call) ·      Point-of-care diagnostics enabling results of lab and instrumental tests in minutes during the house call visit; ·      Providing a patient with tools to objectively monitor health parameters and communicate them to the doctor at any time; ·      Dramatic reduction of the paperwork for doctors and nurses allowing to spend more time with a patient; ·      Control the quality of care by peer reviews (second opinion) and patient evaluation of the services and results of the treatment; Service Traveling nurses visit patients at home, provide on-site diagnostics and communication with primary physicians and specialists to treat a wide spectrum of diseases. Nurses come equipped with hospital grade POC diagnostic instruments to provide quality care 24/7 and replace costly ER visits for non-life threatening conditions. Product The product consists of hardware and software. The hardware is a set of FDA-approved portable diagnostic devices including blood cell counter, blood chemistry, coagulation meter, urine analyzer, pathogen and biomarker detecting devices, ultrasound, ECG, vital signs monitor, digital stethoscope and multipurpose video camera.  All devices are connected to the laptop and packed in the convenient lightweight case that fits in the trunk of the car and can be easily delivered to the patient’s bed. The software enables automatic secure transfer of the test and lab results from devices into the patient records and further to any EHR.  The friendly interface tailored to primary care needs reduces the amount of time physicians spend on paperwork and patient evaluation by automating diagnosis, prescription creation, and progress notes. Unlike other EMRs the system works in on-line and off-line mode and could be applied at any patient site independent of Internet accessibility. Mobile Medical Office platform connects patients with healthcare providers, enabling scheduling of house call visits similar to scheduling Uber taxi rides as well as secured video chat with a doctor or a team of doctors.
