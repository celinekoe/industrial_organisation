Fight back with DUI Dodger, the app that allows you to view and submit DUI checkpoints in your area. The idea is that information is power, and people will be less inclined to drink and drive if they know that there is a checkpoint in their area, that they are drunk, and that driving drunk carries major consequences.   DUI Dodger lets users mark exactly where they saw a DUI checkpoint, which can then be seen by anyone in the area who has the app on their phone.   DUI checkpoints are always changing, so listings expire automatically after 24 hours. If a user finds that a listing is inaccurate, they can â€œflagâ€ the listing and it will be indicated on the DUI checkpoint detail screen.   DUI Dodger also comes with a Blood Alcohol Content (â€œBACâ€) calculator, as well as a game that aims to detect a personâ€:tm:s sobriety level by simulating a police field sobriety test. The BAC calculator takes in a number of variables, including age, gender, weight, type of drinks consumed, and duration of consumption, and then returns a personâ€:tm:s BAC level based on that information.   In addition to calculating BAC level, DUI Dodger features a â€œwalk the lineâ€ game. In that game, users hold their phone face up, arms extended, and walk in a straight line for 5 to 10 seconds. The phone records the userâ€:tm:s stability as they walk, and averages it out for the user so they can see for themselves how balanced (or unbalanced) they are.   DUI Dodger not only allows users to see and submit DUI checkpoints, estimates their BAC level, and tests their sobriety, it also provides a number of useful and interesting facts and myths about drunk driving. This information, coupled with knowledge about a personâ€:tm:s current sobriety level, will hopefully lead to increased awareness about the dangers of drunk driving.
