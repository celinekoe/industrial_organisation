This is necessary because thereâ€™s a significant number of people in financial sales that have inadequate sales skills or talents. This results in them blowing the value of the lead when they call the prospect and approach the prospect inappropriately. For example, the insurance agent gets a lead for prospect who requested a booklet on annuities. He then picks up the phone calls Mrs. Smith and says, â€œMrs. Smith, I understand you want to buy an annuity.â€ Mrs. Smith is taken back as she has been approached with no finesse and inappropriately. This type of salesperson needs to be trained how to approach the prospect about the prospectâ€™s agenda rather than the salespersonâ€™s agenda. A big part of this training that ProspectMatch uses comes from the book Spin Selling. That book teaches the importance of asking questions rather than speaking. So we use the findings of that research to train the financial professional to call and ask a series of questions that ascertains the emotional motivations of the prospect. Once that motivation is clarified, the professional then has a hook in order to have the prospect take the next step, which is typically to schedule a meeting.","Education, Financial Services, Software",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
