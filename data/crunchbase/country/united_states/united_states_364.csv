As they get to know the company, they immediately become aware of the many positive traits that are not so common among fast-paced technology companies.RAM has focused on the health insurance marketplace since 1981. One of its original founders, Robert A. Tulio, remains as the company’s president and driving force behind its innovations. RAM’s executive management team has been in place for more than three decades, having worked together for more than a combined century at RAM. RAM has grown organically without outside investors. This is the result of RAM’s unwavering focus on the needs of its customers. RAM started as an IT consulting firm focused on health insurance business. As the market changed and customer needs evolved, so did RAM. The emergence of managed care dictated the need to streamline operational processes and accommodate rapid growth. RAM met those needs with the introduction of the HEALTHsuite application in 1995.RAM while partnering with a managed Medicaid health plan.  RAM maintained the ownership of the application and this became the nucleus for what is now HEALTHsuite Mercato. “The vision for the company was to become a software solution leader in the healthcare payer market. This opportunity enabled us to realize the vision and they were off and running from there,” stated Robert Tulio, President of RAM Technologies, Inc.RAM has delivered many of the industry’s “firsts” and achieved numerous milestones. These include being among the first to offer a web-based health plan management application and the launch of a “real-time” health plan web portal. As a true pioneer, RAM recognized the need to evaluate and pursue newly evolving technologies, knowing that these technologies would have limitations at first, but would ultimately streamline deployment and simplify maintenance, enabling the company to refine and evolve the applications into today’s industry-leading solution.AM maintains that pioneering spirit and is the leading provider of solutions for health plans serving Managed Medicaid, Medicare Advantage and dual-eligible programs.","Health Care, Software",,,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

OneCoin Update is where you can find the latest news on OneCoin, the fastest growing cryptocurrency in the world. So what exactly is OneCoin and how is it different than Bitcoin? Created through a process called “mining,” the service is based around cryptography. Through mining, each digital coin carries a unique identifier, similar to the serial numbers found on paper bills. However, OneCoin is distinct from paper bills in one, very important way. There is a finite number of coins produced. With paper money issued by government mints, there are more bills produced at various times and in various increments. This means that values can rise and fall due to inflation. This is impossible with OneCoin. Another important distinction OneCoin has from paper money is that the coins are impossible to counterfeit. Like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, OneCoin is not tied to any central bank or governmental body. To this end, the value of each coin is based solely on usability, supply, and demand: the founding principles of economics without any of the politics that have driven paper currencies for most of recorded history. OneCoin has one of the largest currency reserves in the world, at 120 billion units. This means that users are guaranteed security with regards to their digital economic reserves. Users can also be sure that there is security from corrupt merchants, such as organized crime members and criminals from every walk of life. When one joins the OneCoin network, they instantly join the millions of miners who use their digital currency in a fully transparent manner to buy all sorts of goods and services. You can make also payments and transfer money from any country, no matter where you find yourself, and know that there is no potential shady dealings tied to your account or your savings.",Financial Services,1,Ruja Ignatova,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Digital information from this same image is used to encrypt all communications, whether they are text-based messages or shared files (users may share files of any type with each other).
