The company’s Identity Resolution Engine™ (IRE) is used to perform:  1. Federated Search across internal and external third-party data sources without the need for moving or cleaning data.  2. Intelligent Identity Resolution which solves for variations in dozens of attribute types.  3. Protected Data Search, whereby only a patented match probability score is returned without revealing personally identifiable information.  4. Social Link Discovery detects hidden relationships between entities across data sources. Unlike traditional link tools which require hours of investigation and input from analysts, IRE actually ‘discovers’ those hidden groups of connected entities instantly.  5. Link Analysis and Visualization ‘draws’ up the matches and relationships that are discovered, or alternately delivers them into existing applications, so that the analyst can spend more time resolving the crime, and less time preparing the data.  6. IRE Rules provides organizations with an automated means by which to adjudicate the results of the matches and social links discovered in various data sources. Accounting for ‘where’ the results were found and ‘what’ the results imply, IRE automatically takes appropriate actions in real time.
