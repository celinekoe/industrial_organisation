Integrity's investment strategies and management teams will remain in place, and it will retain its current name, location and brand. Additionally, their sector specialists follow all publicly traded companies within their sectors. This allows them to make investment decisions not limited by market capitalization.   Their process includes a disciplined, quantitative framework that focuses their attention on important criteria for value investing valuation and timing. They combine traditional value metrics with growth metrics such as earning estimate(momentum) and catalysts, resulting in a portfolio of timely value stocks. Their advantage there is that they are responsive to market changes and are not preoccupied with the narrow deep-value universe. The result of that advantage is their demonstrated outperformance in both up and down markets.  Risk control is an integral part of their process, allowing them to provide their clients with consistent, superior results. Portfolio constraints limiting position size and actively managing position size over the lifecycle of the investment (start small, add, then trim) help to limit risk and capture more of the stock's return potential.

Existing information and beliefs about mycorrhizal fungi are: 1. ectomycorrhizal fungi infect only woody  plants, and 2. endomycorrhizal fungi infect non-woody plants and a few woody plants. In 1986, Dr. Carol Janerette discovered and invented inoculants from ectomycorrhizal fungi that formed  endomycorrhizal fungus infections with non-woody plants and ectomycorrhizal fungus infections with  woody plants. "" Being able to get one of these fungi that normally forms this relationship with woody  plants to infect non-woody plants is an unexpected and unique observation.”  Plants cultivated with Dr. J's Fungi consistently achieve ""super-sized"" yield increases and fewer cases of life-threatening diseases without harming the environment. Our inoculants are especially efficient in poor soils. Dr. J's Fungi makes the placement of ectomycorrhizae technology into everyday agricultural  practices a reality. Ss Key elements and advantages of Dr. J's Fungi are: 1. Extended shelf life; 2. Especially effective in poor soils; 3. Produced from defined ectomycorrhizal fungi; 4. Sterile and does not transmit pathogens or disease; 5. Effective with both woody and non-woody plants; 6. For non-woody plants, you can select an inoculant for added height or added fullness; 7. Reduce the amount of fertilizer needed for plant growth; 8. No genetic manipulations (non-GMO) are involved in the production of our inoculants; 9. Feathery light and easy to handle; 10.

Oral health is a critical part of overall health and can also have a significant impact on self-confidence. Trying to understand dental plans can feel overwhelming to patients and dental practices. Patients are commonly shocked by their final out-of-pocket costs. This adds to the stress and avoidance many feel when they need care.  At Dentalogic, we make a difference by:          Insurance Verification (IV): Before a patient walks into the office, our team has created an extensive benefit summary of each plan and builds that plan into the office’s practice management system. This allows your dentist to provide each patient with an accurate understanding of the estimated out-of-pocket cost of their dental treatment.          Billing & Collections (RCM): Receiving a detailed summary of each patient’s benefits before a visit only solves part of the issue. The other part is doing what it takes to ensure that each claim is processed correctly.  The Dentalogic team provides the full process of submitting the claims to insurance companies, posting the payments, and doing whatever it takes to get each claim processed quickly and correctly!","Health Care, Professional Services",2,"Mikinzie Broxson, Wyatt Broxson",51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
