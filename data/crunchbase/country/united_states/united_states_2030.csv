In layman's terms, TwitLi.st aims to become the ""list"" of Twitter lists where people can easily find other Twitter users of their interest through recommendations. TwitLi.st's effort for community recommendation search engine will eventually allow new Twitter users to have a ton of great recommended Twitter users to follow. In the near future, when TwiLi.st gathers enough recommendations, TwitLi.st team will introduce the ""List Search Engine"" where Twitter users would be able to search for the most recommended people in their field of interest and with ease. Currently, Twitter itself provides recommendations for new users but these are not based on people's votes. By providing users to recommend their favorite Twitter lists for others, the co-founders Max Lee and Josh Whitford believe this will make Twitter more usable and easier to grasp for those new to Twitter and seasoned veterans who are searching for better Twitter tools for finding new information and people. Plus, the democratic nature of the site will appeal to more people who are not yet familiar with Twitter and are willing to listen to community recommendations. On top of user recommended Twitter Lists, TwitLi.st builds on ""master lists"" that are built by the recommended lists. These ""master lists"" will ultimately list the most recommended(listed) Twitter users first, thereby allowing Twitter users to easily identify the best people to follow on Twitter or so-called ""experts"" in that category. For Twitter users who are interested in recommending Twitter lists to others or want to find out what all the fuss is all about, you can head over to TwitLi.st to recommend your favorite Twitter List.","Apps, Software",2,"Josh Whitford, Max Lee",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

By appearing as one large business which unifies social media presence and internal business systems. They are able to offer a franchise at an affordable rate to existing sole props and to existing salons. They're also able to deal with platforms like Living Socials, Groupon and Amazon Local to negotiate higher deal splits to ensure the franchisee is easily making a profit.
