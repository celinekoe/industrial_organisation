The company has a growing fleet of 8 drones and many different camera and data sensing attachments to handle any job. This means that any job can be delivered, from raw aerial footage delivered on a CD or USB (thumb) drive, to a finished promotional product complete with a custom soundtrack, and anything in between.  Fly Guys is fundamentally a family owned and operated company. The founding brothers, Nick and Tim Handley, both pilots that: Have a love for innovation, a passion for delivering stunning value in an elegant and efficient manner, and complementary production skills with one being the artist and the other being the technician; We will let you figure out which is which!  Fly Guys is more than a company, it is a movement. There is so much value to be delivered by implementing drone technology, and so few qualified compliant people to deliver it. We consider it in our professional ethos to help clients realize this value. Though admittedly, that is unlikely as in addition to the above core competencies, Fly Guys brings many ancillary skill sets to the table because they are: Musicians, a sound and audio production engineer (with a studio), a programmer and web developer, a 5 time inductee into the INC 500, a wedding DJ, a professional photographer and videographer, a firefighter, a plus handicap golfer, a construction engineer, maybe even a Russian and the list goes on.  While the drone commercial space is very new so little commercial experience can legally be claimed, Fly Guys' pilots have ample flight time, flying and recording many events, golf courses and many other venues for hobby and prototype purposes. Being pilots, Fly Guys' dedication to safety trumps all other concerns. So rigorous methodology is employed to assure safety for all those in proximity of the drone operations as well as the airworthiness of the drones.",Sales and Marketing,1,Timothy Handley,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Private,,,,,,
