A system is needed that reduces the energy transmitted to occupant or vehicle during these high energy events. Impact Dispersal Systems, LLC has developed a patented impact dispersion system that has shown dramatic reduction in transmitted acceleration levels. The Impact Dispersal System is a new invention that takes a novel approach to reducing force from impacts. Unlike other systems, the Impact Dispersal System does not absorb the force, but disperses it away from the point of impact. The system quickly reacts, dispersing the crash energy at the point of impact and then systematically shuts down according to the amount of crash energy produced by the impact . This feature is the unique characteristic of this invention. The system has no recoil which can be important in some applications. Impact Dispersal systems received a small business innovative research (SBIR) grant from the Air Force for crashworthy stowable troop seating for helicopter topic number AF081-003. In a proof of concept test conducted by PAR3 Technology for the Air Force, the system had an 86% reduction in transmitted acceleration levels in a 60 G impact test. The system works by using variable dispersion. To give the most protection, the system would have to disperse more of the fluids at the point of impact than it does at the end of the dispersion. To accomplish this it would need different force levels, and different rates of dispersion for each level. If the force from the impact reaches the highest level, all the relief valves will open, and as the force reduces, the relief valves set at the higher level will shut down first. This would continue until all the valves shut down. After having success with the multiple valve system they thought it would be better to incorporate all these features into one valve. They designed, tested and patented a variable one piston valve that can replace the multiple valve system. They also have developed and patented a two piston valve for extreme high-energy impacts using less amount of stroke and a pressure actuating valve for the Impact Dispersal System.","Energy, Government and Military, Health Care",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
