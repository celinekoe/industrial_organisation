No additional data input or building of the system is needed. This component provides the biggest time saver for physicians as it automatically builds the patientâs detailed medical record and SOAP notes for each visit. As the physician diagnoses the patient using the DOX graphical user interface, all the information is being captured and summarized programmatically. The result: Real-time data capture resulting in no hard to read hand written notes, no dictation at the end of the day, and no waiting for days or weeks to complete your patients records. DOX Podiatry leverages the real-time data capture to drive the billing activity that pulls billing codes (ICD and CPT) directly from the physicianâs work in the EMR component. This avoids any duplicate data entry along with associated errors and results in optimized billing results.
