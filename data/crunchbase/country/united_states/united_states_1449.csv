It is one of the most lethal forms of brain cancer. The current standard of care (consisting of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy) is ineffective, and the median survival of a person diagnosed with glioblastoma is about 15 months; without treatment, it is a paltry 3-6 months. Although radiation and chemotherapy prolong life, they greatly reduce quality of life—so much so, in fact, that some patients opt out of treatment. The purpose of Glioblastoma Foundation is to transform the standard of care for glioblastoma by supporting the development of drug therapies for glioblastoma. Researchers have found that each glioblastoma is different, and as such a targeted approach to therapy may be necessary. Glioblastoma Foundation focuses on supporting the development of targeted therapies, those based on the molecular features of each tumor. It is likely that no one therapy will be enough to beat glioblastoma. Multiple drugs will inevitably be needed to block the many molecular signaling pathways present in glioblastoma, thereby disabling the cellular machinery that allows tumors to recur. The research we support will transform glioblastoma therapy and prolong the lives of glioblastoma patients. We need your help. Please join us on the journey to improve the prognosis and quality of life of patients diagnosed with glioblastoma. Our mission is to modify the current standard of care for glioblastoma by replacing radiation and chemotherapy with targeted small molecule therapies that prolong survival and increase quality of life. Our vision is to transform glioblastoma to a manageable chronic condition.",Health Care,1,Glioblastoma Foundation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Together these RM technologies are transforming healthcare. The RM field has taken a quantum leap forward with the introduction into the clinic of cell and gene-based therapies, which can cure underlying disease, rather than simply manage symptoms or slow disease progression. RM technologies, with their power to restore and regenerate regardless of the underlying medical indication (e.g. aging, cancer, trauma), are transforming the therapeutic landscape in much the same way as antibiotics and biotech did in previous decades. Antibiotics transformed the treatment of bacterial infections in the 1940s, and in the process created the big pharma industry.

Aqqaint is a trust networking platform that allows anyone to exchange products, services, and reviews safely.  Our service extends our member's reputation beyond first-degree connections to build powerful networks without sacrificing trust, for the sharing economy. People want to make and save money sharing the stuff they own or selling their goods or services to others in need.  This is evidenced by the 157 million users who visit peer-to-peer classified sites each month.  In fact, the sharing economy is expected to top $335 billion by 2025.  The other important factor for individuals is trust.  92% of people surveyed trust recommendations from people they, more than any other source.  Trust is built on four key fundamentals; credibility, reliability, intimacy, and understanding motivation.  All of these are built over time and through repeated activity.  So, it’s no wonder that we trust people we know more than strangers. While there are a handful of options to facilitate these peer-exchanges they all completely ignore or poorly handle the role of trust.  This has created an environment of anonymity and zero accountability on the ends of the buyer or seller.  On some platforms it has created an environment conducive to scams and violent crimes.  On others it has created a negative incentive for sellers to propagate fake or highly-incentivized reviews to drive sales. 70% of Americans report shopping online and spent more than $452 billion last year alone. Environmental factors and stagnant wages for the middle class are driving people to save money and live sustainable lifestyles.  Millennials in particular are driven to make their dollar count.  So reliable reviews and a safe means to buy or borrow used goods and services is extremely valuable. Aqqaint delivers an environment that removes the uncertainty from the current sharing economy and peer-review systems through trust networks curated by our members which extend their real-life reputation to the web.  Aqqaint’s members build a powerful network of trusted individuals as they can exchange with anyone, they share a direct or mutual connection with.  Additionally, organizations such as schools, non-profits, corporations, etc can establish customized “Aqqaint Communities”, trust networks, for their members or employees which add value, engagement, and increase retention.  These trust networks can be used to exchange goods, services, or share reviews.   Overview: Aqqaint provides all the functionality you would find in an online classified tool such as LetGo, OfferUp, or Craiglist, plus a patent-pending AI-assisted Trust Scoring Machine (TSM) that evaluates and scores individual users trustworthiness based on common interpersonal trust traits, user feedback, and outside information.   Members start by connecting with people or organizations they trust, and then in a similar fashion to LinkedIn, Aqqaint displays mutual connections where to expand the power of that members sharing network.  From there members can buy, sell, loan, rent, look for and share reviews with one another.   Who’s on Aqqaint: Aqqaint’s trust networks are made up of a combination of individuals from all walks of life.  We have college students just starting out to baby boomers looking to downsize.  The primary demographic that Aqqaint is seeing the highest engagement from are 21-35-year-old’s who are familiar with the sharing economy and want to make an impact through their personal consumption behavior.   We have also seen great interest from community leaders who are looking to create trust networks on Aqqaint for their organizations.  They are focused on adding value for members and boost retention rates.  Some of which have paid memberships for their particular organization. Currently, we have a neighborhood association, a parent teacher organization for a local school, a major U.S. University with more than 15,000 members including students and alumni, and a federal union with over 1 million members. All have actively demonstrated their intention to take advantage of our community feature.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Commerce and Shopping, Community and Lifestyle, Data and Analytics, Internet Services, Other, Privacy and Security, Professional Services, Science and Engineering, Social Impact, Software",3,"Matt Park, Nick Portlance, Steven Garofano",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Raised and non-raised floor data centers, with or without a ceiling plenum, form the basis of a model. Libraries of common cooling and IT equipment are available. Irregular room shapes or objects are easily made and the body-fitted meshing algorithm ensures that angled boundaries are properly captured using non-rectangular elements. Several modeling choices are available for computer room air conditioners (CRACs), including flow direction, thermal cooling method, turning vanes, and failure scenarios. Equipment racks allow for server-level detail, including blanks and gaps. CoolSim was developed as a client-server system. The desktop computer is used for model creation, and a remote simulation facility (RSF) is used for model processing. Once built, the model is automatically uploaded to a shared server where tools are used to build a computational mesh, solve for the fluid flow and temperature distribution, and generate a comprehensive report. The report is then returned to the user for viewing on the local PC where it can be embedded in a PowerPoint presentation. It includes a numerical summary of the temperatures and flow rates through all equipment in the room. Energy calculations provide a benchmark for comparing one design against another. Graphics are in a format that allows mouse manipulation of the view. A freely available viewer can be downloaded to any PC for viewing the graphics and viewing does not require an active CoolSim session. High resolution hardcopy files can be created from the graphics for use in reports or presentations. Often, data center design is an occasional activity based around a project timeline. By contrast, full-time CFD analysts use the tools daily. For full-time analysts, annual licenses for unlimited use are common, but this approach is too costly for occasional users. For this reason, CoolSim uses a subscription model based on the anticipated use of the tool over a period of time. Based on the actual usage, the subscription price can scale up or down when the license is renewed.","Hardware, Information Technology, Software",,,11-50,1,Seed,109999,USD,109999,109999,USD,109999,,,,1,Private,,,,,,
