It was all too often we heard feedback regarding the dull, painstaking and time consuming processes common to their workflows. These individuals were spending countless hours and effort capturing images – only to be left creating mediocre results that still required additional attention in editing software. The need for a refined workflow that would allow individuals to efficiently capture, edit and process high quality images was apparent. The information search began and ended soon after. The conclusion being existing photography software’s were piecemeal, required skilled users and didn’t cater specifically to business photography applications. This led to the development of Shutter Stream Product Photography Software – the world’s first fully integrated image capture, editing and processing software designed for in-house photography. Soon after the release of Shutter Stream, we received feedback from customers telling us the software was perfect for 360 Product Photography. We tailored the software to further enhance picture taking and imaging capabilities for the 360 imaging workflow and integrated a 360 Product View Creator Software. The result being Shutter Stream 360 Product Photography Software. Understanding our customers’ requirements and delivering products to meet these needs has been critical to Iconasys’ success. We aim to continually improve our product offerings to fill the needs of our underserved target market – businesses who require high quality and high volume in house photography.
