The book deals with life’s storms that the boy and his son experienced and how their faith, in particular as practiced in their everyday lives, affected, and strengthened them so that they could move through the storms of life and emerge from the eye of those storms, remaining strong and committed in their Faith.  There is a stark comparison of life under the oppression of Muslim radicals seeking to eliminate Christianity; life under the control of the Nazi and Gestapo tyranny; and life under the Constitution of the United States where we are guaranteed freedom of religion, speech, choice, and the other rights granted Citizens of these United States of America.  The author warns future generations to not overlook the price paid for these freedoms; and that, if ignored, the suppression, tyranny and genocide that was suffered by our forefathers, which still exists in other parts of the world, can be experienced again by us, even here, in the United States of America.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
