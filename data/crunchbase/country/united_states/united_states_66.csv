BoomTime's initial services include robust Instant Gift Certificate functionality, Dynamic Websites, and an Appointment Request feature. Service-based companies have been traditionally under-served on the Internet, since it's difficult to ""buy a massage"" over the Internet.  Given that the service-based sector is the largest sector in the US and world economies, and general public acceptance of the Internet for business transactions has steadily increased over the years, SpaBoom is well positioned for growth. SpaBoom is one of several brands the company uses to reach niche markets. The other brands are [CoverBoom](www.coverboom.com) and [BoomTime](www.boomtime.com), for restaurants and the horizontal market, respectively. SpaBoom first tested the concept of Instant Gift Certificates with spas and salons, due to the perceived importance of gift certificates (up to 30% of their business) and Internet leads to these organizations. It was discovered that almost one-half of gift certificate purchasers wait to buy until the last 48 hours of a holiday or event. Providing an instant gift capability has allowed SpaBoom customers to greatly increase their sales by catering to the last-minute purchaser, where the delays associated with manual fulfillment and/or postal mail is nonexistent. In 2006, SpaBoom started work on a distribution model, that enables it to sell the Instant Gift Certificates of its clients and push the inventory of Instant Gift Certificates to other distribution networks. SpaEmergency (www.spaemergency.com) was formed in 2006 to sell Spa and Salon Instant Gift Certificates, and a strategic relationship with Zagat Survey (www.zagat.com) was formed in 2008 for its CoverBoom clients. By July, 2008, SpaBoom boasts over 10% of the Spa market with 2,600 spas and salons in North America. It is anticipated that CoverBoom will boast over 1,000 restaurants by the end of 2008.","Commerce and Shopping, Financial Services, Information Technology, Internet Services, Messaging and Telecommunications",2,"Benjamin Morin, Bill Bice",11-50,2,Early Stage Venture,1300000,USD,1300000,1300000,USD,1300000,"Verge Fund, Spafinder Wellness",2,2,,Private,,,,,,

The product portfolio currently includes analytical portfolio managers, support applications, and subscription services.  NillaHedge is the star of the show, managing a portfolio of stocks and options, with supporting functionality provided by StrategyExplorer and YieldCurveFitter.  BondManager provides analogous functionality for a portfolio of bonds, also supported by YieldCurveFitter.  The applications are priced like graphical calculators, yet offer analytics used by professional fund managers. NillaHedge's OptionAnalyzer computes implied volatility, the probability of closing in the money, elasticity, and a half-dozen Black-Scholes greeks.  Its HedgeExplorer allows users to scroll through graphical realizations of the profit profile for every possible option spread and stock hedge drawn on an underlying stock.  Three more graphical tools provide insight into the performance of the option portfolio and individual options with respect to time, the risk free rate, and the underlying stock's volatility, in the TimeDecayExplorer, RateSensitivityExplorer, and VolatilityValueExplorer. Similarly, BondManager includes a BondAnalyzer that computes current yield, yield to maturity, Macaulay duration, modified duration, convexity, and imputed value at a given change in spot market yield.  BondManager's RateSensitivityExplorer facilitates an understanding of how the existing portfolio and individual issues will respond to changes in market yields. Both NillaHedge and BondManager include PortfolioNavigator and PositionTranscripts.  PortfolioNavigator facilitates browsing open positions in the form of a folding spreadsheet.  PositionTranscripts makes it easy to export a calendar year of transactions for tax purposes. StrategyExplorer is a tool for planning option spreads and stock hedges, thus supporting NillaHedge. YieldCurveFitter is a support tool for fitting yield curves, with serveral uses.  It computes the spot rate of interest used by NillaHedge as the risk free rate and a rational yield curve given a set of yields, like the U.S. Treasury Bill rates.  Fixed income investors watch the 'risk free' U.S. T-bill rate curve so they can assess premiums offered by other instruments over the T-bill yield curve. A StockManager is brewing which will scatterplot stocks in volatility-return space, allowing users to rapidly identify issues with high Sharpe ratios.  StockManager will also include a PortfolioEvaluator that computes the maximum return portfolio at a given tolerance for risk and juxtaposes the user's portfolio weights and Value-at-Risk against results for the mean-variance optimized portfolio.

She frequently overheard her students making disparaging remarks about Indians as nothing more than cabbies and gas station attendants. She became driven to combat these stereotypes and educate Americans about the diverse and often stellar contributions of largely diverse and Asian community. She began doing exhaustive research, digging up press coverage of South Asians who were at the top of their various fields, which she then shared with everybody she knew, including her students. Rashmee also thought it was important for her children’s generation and those to come to understand the rich heritage that continues to develop around the world, and on which they can build their own legacies. The idea for the Roshni books took root. Rashmee formed a team of research assistants, graphic designer, and marketing executive. They began scouring the United States for success stories to share, and the result of their early efforts was Roshni, the Light of South Asia. It took thousands of miles of travel and many hours of networking and interviews, but the book was released in 2005. It was an award winning first ever comprehensive documentation of a unique historical perspective on inspirational biographies of successful South Asians in the United States. Roshni book was globally launched including USA, Canada and India. The book received appreciation from the President of India and other prominent global leaders. Rashmee always knew the Roshni legacy would be endless, so there will always be another book to produce. A second book was necessary to include some of the diverse inspirational individuals in the United States who didn’t fit into the first book, and to bring in some of the heroes who had made their own success in Canada as well. Rashmee brought in senior editors and research team to help with the composition of the profiles, and a new book came to life. Roshni, the Light of South Asia: North American Edition was launched in October 2012, the book received much recognition and due to extreme demand is in the process of second reprint. In 2013, while working on her upcoming book on Global & Emerging Leaders, Rashmee met with Mani Kamboj as prospective Roshni honoree. Mani – a young visionary leader in her own right – as a partner in software firm and a Hollywood film producer eventually ended up sharing common objectives and vision with Rashmee. Mani Kamboj is now a partner and President of Roshni Media Group. Together Rashmee & Mani recreated and reinvented the company while keeping the core vision & mission of creating global diversity awareness. Under Mani Kamboj’s initiative Roshni Media Group now via multiple platform announced Roshni Awards Gala 2015 in May at the hotel Pierre in New York City. The third and most ambitious book on Global & Emerging leaders- featuring of our Roshni honorees was launched at the Awards Gala.","Community and Lifestyle, Content and Publishing, Education, Events, Media and Entertainment",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
