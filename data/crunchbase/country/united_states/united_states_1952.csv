For us, there are three big turn-offs when it comes to music services: stale playlists, hit-or-miss recommendation engines, and the doubt/anxiety caused by simple thumbs up or down input. Not to mention the ads. We believe that radio needs to be a good mix of the familiar with the avant-garde, along with the ability for the individual listener to truly influence the music. And it needs to sound great whether you're actively personalizing it or just passively listening. Our founder, Eric, has been trying to give people the music they want to hear for the past 30 years (seriously!). Beginning with his man-on-a-mission campaign to improve turnout at his college fraternity social by swapping the deejay's untested, unfamiliar LPs with crowd-pleasing hits, Eric has demonstrated time and again that people are happier â and listen/stay/party longer â when the music balances well-known hits with new discovery. We designed Mad Genius to keep you listening. It's easy to combine different types of music and influence how much you hear of your favorites (or not-so-favorites).  You'll never hear or see ads on your Mad Genius player. You'll never see us try to predict what you should like based on how you've rated other music, or how other listeners have rated it. However, you will hear great music that you can influence with ratings from 1 to 5, requests, skips and deletes, for starters. And you can always change your mind. A few other things we wanted when we set out to create the ultimate radio player: to be able to walk away for a few minutes and then come back and rate the music we missed, to go on auto-pilot for awhile, without touching a thing, and still have great music we like, to max out on all the cool new hits every once in awhile, to Request songs and artists and rate them too, even if they haven't played yet or if they are from a genre not currently playing. - See more at: http://www.madgeniusradio.com/about/#sthash.a5juS7Uu.dpuf","Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
