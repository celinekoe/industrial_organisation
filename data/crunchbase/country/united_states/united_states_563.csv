Already having developed an in-house library of 400 million original molecules and with the value of its capabilities independently recognized by 4 scientific Grants in both the USA and Europe, Carmolex is a 'diamond in the rough.'

Carmolex is important because big? pharma is finding it difficult to refill its new drug pipelines as more of their billion dollar block buster patents expire.
