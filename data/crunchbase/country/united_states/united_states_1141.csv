Led by Mike and Julie Signorelli, co-lead pastors and co-founders, V1 Church has added three locations in just three years and continues to welcome new members at a brisk clip.  With an inclusive message tailored to skeptics and the “un-” and “de-” churched, Pastor Mike Signorelli’s sermons speak to members from all walks of life — helping thinkers believe and believers think, as he puts it. V1 Church’s rising profile allows it and its members to make a real difference in their communities, as well. Since the church’s inception, members have contributed more than $300,000 to New York-area homeless shelters, among other examples of grassroots generosity. V1 Church: Origins and Message V1 Church is the product of a period of momentous change in Mike Signorelli’s life. A committed atheist in his younger years, Signorelli was moved to rediscover his faith at a futurist conference in the mid-2010s. One of the speakers there, a preacher, made a convincing case that the world would be lost without spirituality — and without capable spiritual leaders to help people discover their inner faith. Signorelli was so moved by the preacher’s message that he resolved to reorient his life around it. He, his wife Julie, and their two daughters relocated from Indiana to New York and set about bringing the organization to life.  Their vision was as simple as it was refreshing, oriented around a precept that’s often repeated in worship: “Come once and you’re our guest. Come twice and you’re family.” The Signorelli’s aimed to create the sort of church described in the Bible: filled with insightful teachings, honest friendships, heartfelt worship and prayer, and abundant compassion for those who need it most. V1 Church in the Community Under the Signorellis’ guidance and with the support of an ever-growing Impact Team, the organization has quickly become an indispensable presence in its community. Its members’ combined $300,000-plus in gifts to New York City homeless shelters is just one example of the congregation’s abundant generosity. Other charitable projects in which V1 Church is involved include: Providing sorely needed relief for New Yorkers during the COVID-19 pandemic Serving meals and fellowship at greater New York soup kitchens Hosting blood drives throughout the year Paying off school lunch debt for needy children Donating Thanksgiving meals to undocumented families Running Operation Holiday Impact, a massive support program for families experiencing financial struggles during the holiday season V1 Church Today Today, the church continues to work toward the perfection of Mike Signorelli’s founding vision. The church’s growing membership supports an active, multifaceted ministry focused on at-risk youth, people experiencing homelessness, and other vulnerable populations.  V1 Church’s worship sessions take place at three conveniently located outposts in greater New York: the United Artists Theatre in Farmingdale; the Shops at Atlas Park Theater in Queens; and the Loft Sound Studio in Syosset. During the pandemic, V1 Church provides a digital livestream of Pastor Signorelli’s sermons each Sunday, with archival footage available for congregants who can’t be present for the virtual service.",,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Our first product eAsthma Tracker has been shown to reduce child asthmatic hospital readmissions by 98%.  Product/Services:  Our platform reduces recurring emergency room visits and hospitalizations by tracking symptoms and notifying physicians of progress for patients suffering from chronic diseases outside of the hospital.   Our technology seamlessly integrates tracking, notification, scoring and is based on clinical research conducted at the University of Utah and Intermountain’s Primary Children’s Medical Center. Customer problem:  Asthma is the most common chronic illness in children and a leading cause of hospitalizations. eAsthma Tracker was designed to prevent ER visits and hospitalizations of child asthmatics. The platform can be expanded to include any chronic disease, whose symptoms can be reduced by intervention, such as cardiovascular, COPD, hypertension, and diabetes.  Target market:  Our initial product targets a $3.6 billon market. This is the total direct cost of ER and hospitalizations for asthmatic children. Our next identified market, Cardiovascular, has a cost of $17.5 billon annually. The direct and indirect payer costs for chronic illnesses total over $451 billion annually in the US. Management:  Derek Bereit, Co-Founder/CEO is a graduate of the United States Air Force Academy and University of Chicago, and active in the startup community in New York and Utah prior to starting Symptom.ly. He’s a proven leader with established relationships at insurance payers and Children's Hospitals. Our CTO is an experienced senior software engineer, and worked for 9 years at Cerner. Bob Durkin is a serial entrepreneur with several startups under his belt. He sold the first company he founded to Zoll Medical.  Customers:  (1) Payers: ACA changes are forcing hospitals to find solutions to reduce readmission rates:  CO-OPS (patient owned insurance companies formed under ACA), Accountable Care Organizations (ACO), and State Medicaid/Children Health Insurance Plans (CHIP), (2) Hospitals/Clinics: Improved quality of care, lower re-admissions, and patient population disease management, (3) Foreign government healthcare systems. Sales/Marketing strategy:  Payers are driven by data, clinical validated tools and proven cost savings. Arches Health Plan, our first customer, is a patient-owned CO-OP formed under the Affordable Care Act. There are 23 other state CO-OPs that share best practices, and will learn about our tools success in UT. We are enlisting major Children's Hospitals throughout the country to become champions of our system and share quality of care improvement data. We have signed Children’s Mercy Hospital to a pilot of our product.  Business model:  Our revenue streams are based on licensing our platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and developing customer specific modules (e.g., COPD and patient surveys). Our customer integration will allow Symptom.ly to channel additional products directly to the customer through our platform. Finally, our platform will collect and analyze large amounts of valuable population health data. Competitive advantage:  (1) clinical validation of Asthma Tracker in randomized, prospective $2 million dollar study conducted by University of Utah and Primary Children's Medical Center, (2) exclusive license of platform as a service from University of Utah,  (3) Patent Pending.","Health Care, Information Technology",1,Derek Bereit,1-10,1,Seed,300000,USD,300000,300000,USD,300000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Utilzing their core technology to they continue to identify additional, ""drugable"" bacterial enzymes that not only reduce drug toxicity but modulate human disease. Their initial program focuses on alleviating the toxicity associated with chemotherapeutics essential for the treatment of cancer. Toxicity of these drug classes is caused by the reactivation of therapeutic metabolites in the GI by the resident bacteria. In fact, they have shown that a single enzyme, bacterial beta-glucuronidase, is responsible for this dose limiting toxicity. Their novel and proprietary lead candidates selectively and potently inhibit this bacterial enzyme, which is widely expressed in the intestinal symbiotic bacteria. Candidates are at least 10,000-fold more selective for this bacterial enzyme than the human orthologous enzyme. Their potency is lower nanomolar on-target with a clearly established mechanism of action.

Whether a client is working with novel data (e.g. Next-Generation Sequencing data) in the precision medicine arena or entering new regulatory terrain (e.g. licensure under the FDA Animal Rule), innovative strategies are required to help navigate these challenges. BSSI’s Precision Statistics® approach supports clients towards developing the right study design, and implementing the appropriate analytical approach, with validated analyses appropriate for regulatory submission.
