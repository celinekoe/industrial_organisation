The magic behind Octacore lies in its core technology, which is built around two pivotal standards: ERC4337, known as **Account Abstraction**, and ERC6551, referred to as **Token Bound Accounts**. These standards are fundamental in providing individual wallets for any NFT and, consequently, making the web3 world ripe for reaching the masses.             OctacoreAI takes a two-pronged approach:             1. OctaMind - AI Driven Development: It is chatbot for AI-driven development for Web3 using Octacore's APIs and SDKs. OctaMind is designed to handle Web3 specific queries and help developers understand web3 concepts, how to build web3 projects using Octacore including step-by-step guides, code snippets and help with any queries related to Octacore's products and services. Deploy Cryptocurrencies, NFTs, DAOs, AI-Generated Suites, Build dApps, all from a chat.                      2. Szabo - General Purpose Web3 Agent: The Szabo model helps users to navigate the complex world of Web3 with natural language with conversational user flows. This model fetches on-chain data and renders a button to execute transactions to fulfil all your Web 3 needs including DeFi, NFTs, DAOs and so much more.              Additionally, you can also integrate Szabo into your platform to give your users the power to converse to your platform and construct custom and complex transaction and that they can execute right during conversation, GASLESSLY.             The core technology empowers three integral layers of Octacore:                          IDENTITY LAYER: Simplifies user onboarding to dApps with a PLUG-N-PLAY infrastructure, offering customized solutions like Social Login, Smart Login, and TBA Login.                          APPLICATION LAYER: Streamlines the development process by providing ready-to-deploy, audited Templates and Suites of Smart Contracts, and assists in managing roles, upgrades, and other smart contract interactions.                          DATA LAYER: Offers fast and reliable data through APIs, SDKs, and Webhooks, eliminating the need for node management and intricate blockchain development knowledge.                          Together, these layers, powered by Account Abstraction (ERC4337) and Token Bound Accounts (ERC6551), simplify building, deploying, and managing dApps, making them accessible and ready for widespread adoption.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Data and Analytics, Internet Services, Science and Engineering, Software",,,1-10,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

It was there that what is thought to be the country's first ""drive-in"" featuring ""tray-boys"" for curb side service, opened up. In 1922 Allen took on a partner, Frank Wright, an employee from his original Lodi location.

Once the brand started to gain momentum, Kemper moved its board production to a snowboard factory in Montreal, Canada for the 1988/89 snowboarding season. In 1989/90 the snowboard production moved to Austria.  Kemper Snowboards quickly became one of the biggest snowboarding brands in snowboard history and competed directly against Burton Snowboards, Sims Snowboards, and Barfoot Snowboards. The Kemper snowboarding brand was best remembered for fully embracing snowboarding’s neon period in both their snowboard graphics and their incredible range of funky outerwear. In 1989 business was booming and Kemper had one of the best professional snowboard teams of the era. David Kemper eventually partnered with a windsurfing distribution company in Glendale, California called the Romney Group who added Kemper Snowboards to their portfolio of snowboarding brands. During that time, David relocated to California to help oversee the business, team management, and the growing product line. In 1992, David sold his remaining shares of the company to focus on his college education.  By 1994 the company was sold to an in-line skate company on the east coast. A couple of years shortly after, Kemper Snowboards officially went out of business. In the winter of 2018, Jib Hunt, a former professional snowboarder, relaunched the Kemper Snowboards brand. In the summer of 2019, Hunt moved Kemper’s headquarters from the east coast to Park City, Utah to better position the snowboarding brand for growth and exposure within the Utah snowboarding scene. Kemper Snowboards produces freestyle snowboards, park snowboards, powder snowboards, splitboards, and snowboards packages. The original Kemper professional snowboard team consisted of Mike Basich, Tina Basich, Dave Dowd, Martin Gallant, Kurt Heine, Andy Hetzel, Brett Johnson, Adam Merriman, George Pappas, Nick Perata, J.D.
