The region dominates the African imported sugar market, having imported 2.3 million metric tons in 2013. This represent two thirds of all African imports worth $US1.32B. It is projected that this significant import trend will continue for years to come. The 2015 year projects a growth rate of 11%.    Due to a significant number of small and medium size companies that make up the secondary buyer's market, and the local culture of paying cash, several large multinational trading companies have been able to take advantage of these factors. This results in country selling prices carrying a premiums of $60 to $100 per ton.    West Africa Sugar Distributors LLC 's business model is simple. WASD has contracted with a Brazilian Sugar Refiner. The two major points of the agreement are a very advantageous formula for their buying price,. This allows us a significant margin, that not only allows us to discount in country selling price, but leaves us a very generous gross margin per ton.    The second major point is the opportunity to draw purchased stock from their Refiner's West Africa warehousing facility. This will mean a four day transit time to the port of discharge, which will comfortably allow WASD to complete at least two 12,500mt shipments a month for a total of 25,000mts per month, 300,000mts annually.
