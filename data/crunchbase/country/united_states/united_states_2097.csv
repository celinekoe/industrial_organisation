It would be an honor if you would allow me the opportunity to introduce myself and explain what we offer in the field of Industrial Automation and Integration.  Foremost, I am a follower of Christ. The company is designed around moral design, which comes with such a declaration. Without Christ, we are nothing. As the CEO of the company, it is my magnificent obsession to see your process, company, employees, and customers receive the highest level of service that can be offered in the industry. Titan is not only raising the bar in this industry we are redefining and redesigning the bar itself.  How are we doing that? Just to carry the title of Titan requires greater than five years of hands-on systems knowledge. Titans must be experts in a minimum of five separate applications with robotics and must have extensive PLC expertise. All of which a Titan is certified in by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). Titans are truly the pinnacle of the industry! What does that mean to you and your company? It means that when you call Titan Group you get the best in the industry. Titans have paid their dues to this industry and have earned their title through overcoming unbelievable odds to accomplish their mission. Why would you choose Titan Group over any other company? As a company, we are young. We just got our Tax ID last year. However, the personnel in the company have decades of experience in multiple areas of automated manufacturing and process automation controls: We created the company as a means to not only care for our families but to actually bring people on who had our same values. We are tired of seeing large companies take smaller companies to the bank just to make a few extra dollars. Instead, we are better than the bigger companies and we care more because at the end of the day it is our families’ name that is on our work, not just Titan's. Other companies offer a body, one person who is versed either in one or maybe three of the required fields which you may need. We offer a one stop full integration service that is truly not just setting the bar but redefining the bar itself. Titan offers something that no other company in the world offers: a TITAN. Truly a professional expert who is driven by our core values. God First, Military Precision, and Deeply ingrained obsession. If you are going to do something, you cannot do anything except through Christ, Phil. 4:13. If you are going to put your name on it you must have such a diligent precision that even the world’s greatest military would take notice. However, if you are going to be the one with the answers you must be completely and thoroughly obsessed with your outcome that it almost becomes an addiction. Titans are all of these simply for the drive of being the best that we can be.  It would be an honor to introduce Titan and myself to you and your company.  How to contact Titan: You are more than welcome to call, text, email, or even write a letter.  I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.  Thank you for your time and may God bless you and yours.",,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Their four brands; LawDingo, DocDingo, PsychDingo, and CashDingo; connect people with attorneys, physicians, therapists and accountants. they get you near-instant professional help with the law and with your body, mind and money. Beat that. Think about the last time you tried to find one of these kinds of professionals. It was a hassle. You didn't know who to pick. It cost more than you thought it would. They have outlined the steps typically involved in this process, from categorization to communication to selection. Dingo products make the most highly paid professionals accessible to the common man with no effort on said man's part. Simply tell us the legal, medical, personal or financial issue you’re concerned about, and they all get you the best mix of price and experience and availability. If the price is good with you, they all have the appropriate professional get in touch to discuss. If you need a local professional by preference or necessity, they all get you someone near you, no problem; if working remotely is cool, you now have access to professionals throughout your state and country, as law permits. But this is already getting more complicated than you need to worry about. All the real-world issues of talking to secretaries, getting voicemails, negotiating, setting up a time to talk, comparing prices, determining licenses, availability, expertise, credibility, sending insurance claims, setting up payment plans, and so on they handle entirely behind the scenes with a proprietary blend of people, technology and spirit. You tell us what you need, and you get what you need. That simple. Sorry to stress you there for a minute. For busy professionals, Dingo products are a godsend too. Ain't nobody got time to fill vacant time slots in your schedule with new clients. Nobody got money to spend on advertising that isn't likely to pay off. Dingo connects with your calendar, learns specifically where your expertise lies and where you're licensed to practice, and rewards you with more clients if the clients they send you report you did an excellent job for them. Provided it works out to a discount to their clients, they simply take a fee from transactions, thus making Dingo risk-free. The Dingo Network was started in 2012, with Lawdingo being its initial product and Y Combinator its initial backer. Our absurd initial launch video is below. The company is founded and run by Nikhil Nirmel, an entrepreneur in NYC, with the rest of team being the best people in the world they can find, working from wherever in the world they like.","Internet Services, Professional Services",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
