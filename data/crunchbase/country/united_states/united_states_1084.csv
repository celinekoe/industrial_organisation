Green Plug,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/green-plug,"Customer Service, Developer Platform, Information Technology, Manufacturing","San Ramon, California, United States",Green Plug develops and markets an embeddable power supply technology for consumer electronics and power supply companies.,"426,777","San Francisco Bay Area, West Coast, Western US",$1M to $10M,Active,2006-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,http://www.greenplug.us,"Green Plug brings about a much needed revolution in the way we power electronic products. Today, dozens of consumer electronics (CE products) require external power adapters and battery chargers. Unfortunately, there is no common interface that will provide for interoperability and reusability, convenience, savings and the reduction of unnecessary components that wind up as eWaste because power adapters are normally thrown away when they are in perfect working condition. That's not sustainable. That's poor economics. And, Green Plug has changed this for the better. Green Plug is the first developer of digital technology that enables real-time collaboration between electronic devices and their power sources. Billions of devices including laptops, printers, speakers, routers, modems, cell phones, entertainment devices, power tools, cameras and so many other portable electronic devices require a power source that converts between 90V and 254V wall power to device-specific DC power. That means that these devices require unique power converters, and that is very costly, is extremely inconvenient and contributes to wasted resources and pollution. Greentalk(TM)-enabled intelligent power supplies, however, communicate with electronic devices and negotiate device power requirements for all devices connected to them. All cables and connectors are uniform; so, they work with any device! Being intelligent power sources, they eliminate wasted ""phantom power"" (power that is wasted when chargers are plugged in and either connected to devices that are fully charged or have no devices connected to them.) Greentalk provides an API for power monitoring and reporting applications as well as advanced control built upon 2-way communication.","Information Technology, Manufacturing, Other, Professional Services, Software",1,Frank Paniagua,1-10,3,Late Stage Venture,,USD,,,USD,,"Imagination Technologies, Peninsula Ventures, Herald Ventures, Killik & Co",2,4,,Private,,,,,,

Its specialties include engagement rings, wedding bands, loose diamonds, luxury watches, non-wedding jewelry, and accessories. Since its founding in 2007, IDNID has helped thousands of people extract real value from unwanted or unneeded jewelry and personal accessories. IDNID’s founder, Josh Opperman, turned a life-altering moment of vulnerability into a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. After returning home from work to find his fiancee gone and her engagement ring sitting unceremoniously on the coffee table, Opperman received a second shock: a series of impossibly low resale offers from local jewelry shops.  Knowing his ring was worth far more than those offers, he took matters into his own hands and started an online jewelry resale marketplace with a simple mission: to cut out the middleman and connect jewelry buyers and sellers over deals that place a fair value on gently used jewelry. “Rather than get mad, I decided to break even,” says Opperman, “and that’s when I launched I Do Now I Don’t.” Opperman at first limited the concept to used engagement rings and wedding bands but quickly realized that it begged for a wider audience. I Do Now I Don’t now serves a wide range of buyers: budget-conscious newlyweds, thrifty fashionistas, discerning types seeking pieces with rare personality. And the marketplace serves an even wider range of sellers, from people who’ve inherited jewelry that they don’t plan to wear, to downsizing couples seeking to raise funds for a move or other life change, to unfortunate souls who find themselves in Opperman’s shoes. I Do Now I Don’t protects buyers and sellers with strict verification and authentication procedures. The company uses GIA certified gemologists to authenticate branded and nonbranded jewelry, and a series of automated and human-driven procedures to ensure that listed items are as described.
