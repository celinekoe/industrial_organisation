Contrarily to some people's misconception (the website is for expats only), LinkExpats serves â€œexpatriates, foreigners, international students, exchange visitors and travelersâ€, and also locals. It was created to allow the international community to interact with each other in any city in the world. Contrarily to major social networking websites like Facebook, MySpace, and LinkedIn, LinkExpats' users cannot befriend each other in the internal section of the website, but they are allowed to contact each other, create ads, participate in the forum discussions and create different events for the users. One of the unique functionalities of the website is that users from a specific country and nationality can create ads, forums, and events only for specific communities in a specific country. As an example, if the user is American and lives in Casablanca, Morocco, then he/she can create an event specifically for Americans living in Casablanca, or create an event specifically for Americans in the world, or all expatriates in Morocco. LinkExpats members are located in over 500 cities, and 150 countries. They discuss typical problems and issues international visitors and expatriates face when in a new country, or when they are trying to relocate to another one.","Community and Lifestyle, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Passitto makes it easy to offer referrals to your friends, group members or the entire Passitto community.  Referrals can be offered for free, or you can also require members to bid credits to express their interest in your referral.  You simply enter the general details of a referral, members can then review these details and can express their interest.  After the close of an offering period for the referral, the user is presented with a list of members who are interested in the referral. Once the user selects a winner using their own criteria, the credits that the winner used to express an interest in the referral are awarded to the user.  This is a true pay or play model, as Passitto credits can be obtained by exchanging referrals or by purchasing credits.   Passitto incorporates traditional business social networking features found on other websites, such user profiles, connections, and groups; however, with Passitto, these features aim to do more than merely connect users to each other.  These features aim to create a community of users who actively generate and reward each other for sending and receiving business referrals. The Passitto community is comprised of professionals representing all types of industries.  Passitto can expand users networking circles far beyond their traditional offline leads groups, while also providing the tools and resources to compliment and create virtual extensions of their offline groups.",Sales and Marketing,1,Jeremy Bamford,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

After an initial extended period of research, the company determined the most viable location to begin its’ first phase of the project, and specifically evaluated mineral deposits with excellent accessibility for year-around production. The company has performed its’ first processing of heavy sand by utilizing a Keene Magnetic Separator, and was able to process 1000 lbs. of raw feed that was separated by a gravity concentration recovery. The concentrate was further analyzed, crushed and leached, and then by fire assay produced 1.15 grams of Gold and 1.95 grams of Silver. The company was also successful in sending 320 lbs. of raw feed to MTI for their metallurgical work-up and testing to produce a heavy metal concentrate and preform a bench scale test to produce typical Magnetite, Titanium, and Zircon products. The company’s next step is to establish its’ mill site for 10 ton @ hour Demo Plant to be placed into operation.","Manufacturing, Natural Resources",,,1-10,1,,400000,USD,400000,400000,USD,400000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

After years of playing football in school, and minor-pro leagues, Langston Gaither was dinged up and ready to retire. Gaither had just started a family and he knew his chances of becoming an NFL athlete were slim to none. But that didn't stop him from wanting to make an impact in football. Gaither had issue that was had been nagging him for years. Whenever he saw an injured player due to a concussion, he wondered if he could improve upon the performance of the equipment. Gaither was far from becoming an expert in brain injuries and had no background in engineering. Eventually he studied helmets and came up with a conclusion that focused on design and performance. From that study, Gaither had idea that could change football forever. He invented Hard Knox Impact Pads.          Langston Gaither knew that Hard Knox Impact Pads were long overdue and needed to be on football field every day. Hard Knox is a major improvement to football helmets as we know them. There has never been a product that has impacted football the way Hard Knox does. But there's only one problem.....Gaither Design Company needs the capital to get Hard Knox to the market. Funds will be used to produce prototypes and to identify a strategic partner that will manufacture this product along with the helmet that it is made for.

Serving as a resource and guide to the entire stock industry, we make every stock photo, Illustration, vector and footage searchable through one easy-to-use platform. Just like other search engines, PicturEngine is FREE to use.  The ability to quickly and easily search the whole stock photo industry at once saves time and ensures the best results. Larger stock photo agencies are included within the organic results.  Photographers and smaller photo agencies, pay a small ‘advertising’ subscription fee to be included within the search results.  It’s important to note that search results are UNBIASED, meaning advertisers cannot pay to gain higher ranking within the search.             As stock photo agencies have grown to mammoth proportions, finding the ""right"" image is more difficult and time-consuming than ever.  Searching through countless images within multiple agency archives has become commonplace, and image buyers say they need to find images faster.  Because only a few agencies practice ""image exclusivity,"" the same content appears over and over again, further complicating the search for stock photos.  PicturEngine search results quickly provide image buyers with industrywide results without duplication.  We show buyers the base agency, removing unnecessary intermediaries, and encourage exploration of content by providing a closer look at ""similars,"" enabling the buyer to make an informed purchasing decision.
