Guaranteed"".  Pay the BuyerPrice, or we'll pay the difference. Now that's something to celebrate!  Headquartered in New York City, BuyerPrice.com was created by a team of nine highly experienced real estate professionals, successful technology entrepreneurs and top level statisticians and software developers who devised a way to help homebuyers get a better deal. We have spent years studying house prices and how they fluctuate according to market conditions and sentiment to build a robust pricing algorithm. We’re so convinced our pricing algorithm is better for our buyers that we guarantee it. Or we’ll pay the difference between our BuyerPrice and the asking price. BuyerPrice is easy to use, and addictive. Buyers simply visit the website, or download the app, and search for homes on any property listing platform like Zillow, Realtor.com or a broker’s site. When the buyer sees a house they like, the guaranteed “BuyerPrice” appears alongside the seller’s asking price. Our negotiators then personally swing into action to secure the lowest possible price, which is often even below the guaranteed BuyerPrice. Our mission at BuyerPrice is to help homebuyers save money. Pure and simple. We’ve developed a service that is fully aligned to the buyer’s best interests and our buyer agents don’t earn a dime unless we save you money.
