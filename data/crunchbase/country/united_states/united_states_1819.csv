Current and forecast Global demand for methanol is expected to grow another 70% over the next 6 to 7 years.  •	Over the same period of time, US oil and gas producers have been so successful in the development of shale gas that the price of the feedstock in the production of methanol, natural gas, has dropped 65% and is not expected to increase significantly for decades. US Methanol intends to enter the methanol production business with the acquisition, relocation, and modification of an existing 9,000 metric tons per year methanol production facility. Our plans include relocating the facility from Utah to natural gas rich Pennsylvania. Upon relocation and re-commissioning, the facility will commence production in the second half of 2015 and will be the only methanol producer in a $375 million Northeastern United States market. With a population of over 59 million within 300 miles of US Methanol’s proposed production facility in Pennsylvania, the methanol market in the Northeastern US is a 750,000 metric tons per year market.  We intend to become “The Methanol Kings of the NE”. Our management team has founded or co-founder numerous successful startups in technology and oil and natural gas. Between them they have taken public or managed 6 public companies and raised over $950 million.

Market leaders, despite their dominance, are now experiencing unprecedented churn and this is because they’ve failed to meet the evolving expectations of their user base. As long term automation users ourselves, we've faced the same issues; high-friction setups, temperamental workflows, and being limited to simple, partial processes. Essentially, it boils down to; usability, reliability, and scalability. The proof is in the data. According to PWC, 69% of automation initiatives fail to execute due to complexity, and of those that do, another 50% then fail later on due to reliability and scalability issues. Clearly there’s an industry-wide problem here. doFlo, powered by asynchronous event streaming technology and AI, addresses these gaps and is so compelling that we’re seeing, not churned, but existing automation users move to doFlo. So what does it look like? Our workflow editor is drag and drop, it’s no code and uses simple annotations in English to create automations for you. It’s easy, if you can plot a flow chart, you can make sophisticated workflows that never fail, in minutes. We plan to maneuver from SMB to mid-market and enterprise, but first we must segment. Our ICP is the unaddressed real estate market, sold via self-service for bottom-up scaling. After monopolizing this, we'll then expand horizontally into more competitive markets. Our competitors serve basic process needs for SMB customers quite well, but their mid-market and enterprise customers seek more scalable and sophisticated workflows. doFlo’s limitless scalability means we meet these expectations perfectly. Our business model is simple. It’s to offer a superior, affordable product for our customers with higher margins for us and our pricing model scales on automation connections and storage capacity. This isn’t the first time I’ve done this. In fact, the doFlo founders have seen repeated success. Across our 12 years together, we’ve founded a number of successful companies, which includes a notable exit to Avast in 2018. doFlo is making good progress so far. We recently hit $5K MRR from our paid pilot program that we opened in December, have 100 accounts on our waiting list, and plan for GA in March 2024.","Information Technology, Sales and Marketing, Software",2,"Thomas Maarseveen, William Butler",1-10,1,Seed,250000,USD,250000,250000,USD,250000,,,,,Private,,,,,,
