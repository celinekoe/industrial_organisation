A Sleeve is an accessory case that fits onto your electronic device.  A portable transceiver and charging unit interacts with a Sleeve the receiver.  The wireless power transmission system requires a combination sleeve and a portable transceiver.   Atom uses wireless magnetic resonance which means as soon as an electronic device comes within 30 feet charging begins immediately- without a 30-pin cable or conductive elements.  We have developed a portable transmitter that uses proprietary software algorithms that reduce energy consumption for the management and control of our solution that will ultimately reside on the device being charged dynamically direct, focus and control our proprietary LI²GHT waveform frequencies.    What’s the difference between our products using our LI²GHT  technology and other wireless power standards?  Our technology  is based on a concept of spatial freedom, which extends wireless power applications “beyond the mat” and accessories market into almost any mobile device and surface. Unlike older technologies based on magnetic induction, LI²GHT  leverages the principles of magnetic resonance, which brings a number of unique benefits to the wireless charging ecosystem.

We think that with everyone carrying powerful game controllers in their pockets (in the form of smartphones), and the emergence of the iPad (which is really a powerful, portable, and easy to use game console, when you think about it) there’s an opportunity to introduce innovative and engaging experiences. Our vision is to harness these capabilities - the display, touch-screen, sensors, networking, powerful CPUs and memory of the average smartphone and iPad-class slates, as well as the power of HTML, CSS, and other emerging technology stacks, on the device and in the cloud - to enable a series of in-person “crowd” experiences with a common DNA: portable, multi-user, multi-display, and real-time. CrowdGame Trivially is the first in this series of experiences. There are plenty of trivia and quiz games available, but we think that Trivially’s characteristics – high-level of UI refinement and reliable, nearly-instantaneous play for many players, coordinated by and displayed on an iPad – sets it apart, and is an ample demonstrator for the potential of this approach. While the classic trivia game probably won’t push the state-of-the-art in terms of game mechanics, graphics, or AI, we had to start somewhere… We’ve got plenty of ideas for what could follow, in social gaming and in other scenarios, such as business or education… anywhere there’s a crowd.","Apps, Gaming, Mobile, Platforms, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Charles Pinot helps the top 1% of people in the prime of their career craft their story into a book that others will find interesting, intriguing, and connect them with the author, company, or brand. Every author approved by the editorial board works with a 5-person team to expedite content creation and promote their book, themselves, and their professional goals in writing the book. No other publisher has the staff, capabilities, or connections that Charles Pinot has in making a book and an author's professional goals for writing the book a success. Over the past fifteen years, the editorial team’s experience in founding two of the leading executive development and thought leadership companies led to the formation of Charles Pinot. The Founder & Editor-in-Chief, Jonathan Aspatore, started Aspatore Books, which he grew over nine years into one of the 5 largest business book publishing houses, publishing over 5,000 of the world’s top business and legal executives, including C-Level executives from 74% of the Fortune 500, eventually selling the company to Thomson Reuters.  Because of Jonathan’s unique background in working with thousands of the world’s top executives, he and the rest of the team saw a void in the marketplace for making it easier for the leading 1% of executives and companies to tell their engaging stories in a book format, and to provide a service and proprietary process that makes this much less time consuming and aligns more directly with the author’s professional goals in writing the book. This vision led to Charles Pinot becoming the most exclusive publisher of exemplary executives and inspiring companies and their stories being shared with millions of readers around the world.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment",1,Jonathan Aspatore,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
