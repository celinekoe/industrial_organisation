As a marketplace, it serves needs beyond eBay and Amazon. As an advertising site, it goes beyond CraigsList, eBay classifieds and other first-generation websites. Goods or services. With our integrated, multi-currency shopping cart, InstantFinder enables you to buy and sell goods, and exchange payment for your transaction, directly on the site. However, mankind cannot live by shopping cart alone. For things that cannot be bought or sold through a shopping cart, e.g., services, buyers and sellers can advertise on InstantFinder to find each other.  All categories. You can buy or sell anything on InstantFinder, except for illegal or socially unacceptable items (which we work diligently to exclude, and commit to removing if they make their way on to InstantFinder.) As a buyer, whether you are looking for fashion wear, baby clothes, automotive parts, or programming services, you can find them on InstantFinder. And if you want something you donâ€™t see, you can place a want ad. As a seller, whether you sell specialty equipment such as for restaurants, or list rental apartments for landlords, you can sell or advertise your offering on InstantFinder. All currencies. Local across town, or across the globe, buyers can buy, and sellers can receive payment, in the currency of their choice. We support seventeen currencies through Paypal, with transparent currency exchange. Integrated marketing. The biggest obstacle to sales and growth is getting the word out. We do several things to help generate awareness and demand for your products and services. On your own, these things would be difficult and expensive. â€¢	Search engines. We list your product on product search engines, so that you are easily found. We optimize our pages for high visibility in natural search. â€¢	Social marketing. As so many buyers and sellers hang out on social networks such as facebook (500 million users), we present your product on our as well as your pages on these social networks. From these pages, word of your products, quality, prices, or service, can spread quickly. We also make InstantFinder visible on blogs, wikis, and other community sites. To be helpful to buyers and sellers, we are careful to provide useful information, not chatter or hype. This makes InstantFinder a trusted marketplace. Merchandising. A good store offers the right products, and the right combinations of products, in one place. And it makes them easily accessible. On InstantFinder, sellers can upload products in minutes. They can easily enhance their catalog with new products as demand evolves. Buyers can browse or search easily. Brand-building. Buyers remember brands. Sellers want their brand to stand out. You can create and enhance your brand with your logo, and your choice of text fonts and backgrounds. You can specify your terms of use, highlight unique capabilities, and include special offers such as free shipping. â€¢	Easy window-shopping. To help buyers shop more easily, we support 360-degree views of products. We support YouTube! videos for richer viewing. Buyers can do this window-shopping at their leisure. With relaxed and convenient window-shopping, buyers can decide more easily and quickly. â€¢	Easy decision-making. Sometimes, before deciding, buyers have questions. Or, they feel more comfortable if they know who they are buying from. InstantFinder provides integrated video chat for buyers to speak with sellers live, and to allow sellers to showcase their products further. Itâ€™s like having the store owner or a highly knowledgeable salesperson at a store answer your questions, or buying from someone you know. â€¢	Payment upon delivery. Whether buying across town or across the world, our payment escrow enables quick purchases with peace of mind for buyer and seller. With payment escrow, buyers buy satisfaction, and sellers know they will get paid.  This is how it works. As a transaction proceeds, InstantFinder notifies buyer and seller at each step â€“ at the time of purchase and payment by buyer, shipment by seller, delivery to buyer, acceptance by buyer, and release of payment to seller.  When the buyer places his order and pays, his payment is immediately put in escrow. At this point, the seller ships to buyer. When the buyer receives the product and accepts it, or when the acceptance period expires, InstantFinder and seller are both notified. InstantFinder immediately releases the payment to seller.  For domestic transactions, the payment escrow period is fourteen calendar days. For international transactions, it is twenty one calendar days. Thus, transactions are settled without risk. If the product is not satisfactory, and the buyer returns it within the escrow period, his money is refunded. This allows buyers to buy without risk, and sellers to extend their sphere of trust.  Ease of use. Our motto for InstantFinder is: Make it simple, then simplify further. All our features are extremely simple-to-use.  â€¢	Bulk upload. Using InstantFinderâ€™s bulk upload feature, a seller can import an entire store, with hundreds of items, from eBay or Amazon, or other marketplaces, in minutes.  â€¢	New listings and changes. A seller can list new products, upload photos, videos and slideshows, change prices, terms, etc., with a few keystrokes. â€¢	Easy checkout. Whether you buy one item or many, from one store or several, our checkout process is the same - simple. â€¢	Up-to-date information on your transaction. InstantFinder provides updates to buyer and seller automatically at each step of the way - order, payment, shipment, delivery, acceptance, and release of payment to seller. Getting started. To import/upload items or browse through products, visit http://instantfinder.com/. Even if you have a store today, our free store will bring you more business. Our support. We try to respond to all questions within 24 hours. As a buyer, we try to make your buying experience the best possible. As a seller, we help your business flourish.  Summary. Buying, selling, and advertising online â€“ locally or globally - has never been simpler, easier, safer, and more economical.  â€¢	The reach of our integrated marketing on search engines and social networks brings buyers and sellers together more easily.  â€¢	Our stores are easy to set up. Our ads are easy to place. And you can build your brand. â€¢	Our easy window-shopping and dialog between buyer and seller simplifies buying decisions.  â€¢	Our payment escrow is automatic and hassle-free, and provides peace of mind for buyer and seller.  â€¢	Buyers get more for their money; sellers can sell more economically.  Your feedback. At InstantFinder, we want to expand and accelerate ecommerce with a new generation of capabilities. We are not replacing first-generation sites, which have served us all well. We aim to supplement them.  We welcome your feedback where we can do better. We want to improve everyday. And if you like what you see, please spread the word.","Commerce and Shopping, Internet Services",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

There are presently over 200 startups in the 3D printing space offering a wide range of products and services, but little collaboration between them. As a result, users are forced to jump through a quagmire of different hoops when trying to go from idea to object. In response, Espen Sivertsen, CEO of Type A Machines took the initiative in January 2014 to create a rapidly growing coalition of non-competing companies looking to connect products and services, share market insights, technology and partnerships. To support BAAM, Type A Machines is building developer friendly modular hardware and software, so providing 3rd party developers a professional platform for their solutions. Partnering members are quickly following suit, and BAAM now hosts a thriving startup ecosystem of 3D scanners, 3D printers, materials, filament recycling, mobile fab labs, modeling services and printing services. Headquartered in San Leandro, California, Type A Machines is partnering with property management and the City of San Leandro to refurbish an 18 acre former Chrysler plant known as The Gate. At the Gate, BAAM members work together as an ecosystem of non-competing products and services, often testing solutions within the city of San Leandro before expanding to the US and global markets.
