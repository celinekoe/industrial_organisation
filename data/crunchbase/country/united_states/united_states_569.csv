Photographers ensure that their image meets the requirements before submitting, which means buyers only see images they can actually use. ImageBrief also allows buyers and photographers to interact and collaborate directly while working on the brief.

(MNTR) is a public company that invests in medical and social use cannabis companies. Mentor takes a 10% to 100% position in the various members of our family of participating companies, but leaves operating control firmly in the hands of the cannabis company founders. Because adult social use and medical marijuana opportunities often overlap, Mentor Capital participates in the legal recreational marijuana market. However, Mentor’s preferred focus is medical and the company seeks to facilitate the application of cannabis to cancer wasting, calming seizures, Parkinson’s disease, reducing ocular pressures from glaucoma and blunting chronic pain. Mentor’s approach and capital structure allows its shareholders to buy an additional $140 million of Mentor shares at approximately a 12.5% discount. As money is sent in to buy into the growing cannabis portfolio, the proceeds are split pro rata amongst the cannabis companies that are participating in the indirect sale. As more private cannabis companies join in the consortium, the MNTR share price is pushed higher, other things being equal. The increasing share price may well increase the exercise of stock options and warrants by both Mentor Capital’s 1,500 mostly accredited shareholders and the public market in general. Using this approach, Mentor seeks to deliver a higher price to founders for a smaller slice of their business. Retaining control and receiving more cash are the two key advantages to cannabis founders working with Mentor Capital, Inc. Mentor Capital migrated to the cannabis space from leading-edge cancer investments when government actions collapsed the new leading cancer sector (e.g. Dendreon, the market leader, dropped from $44 per share to $2.90 per share.) Mentor still retains some cancer investments, but will complete the shift to the cannabis marketplace as profitable opportunities to exit present themselves. Originally, Mentor Capital was formed in Silicon Valley in 1985 with $1,000 by current CEO, Chet Billingsley. The company completed dozens of early private acquisitions and went public in 1995. Mentor Capital feels there is significant opportunity to approach the medical marijuana market as a business-focused, high-integrity, public company providing significantly more financing to private cannabis companies. As a result, Mentor will be able to return increasing stock value to the investing public. As a distinct first step in this direction, the Mentor CEO has placed his shares in escrow with a law firm to obviate the risk of pump and dump activity that has otherwise been associated by regulators with other public marijuana related firms. Cannabis related firms seeking a larger amount of long-term cooperative financing, for a smaller slice of their business, are encouraged to contact Mentor Capital to discuss reserving their pro rata portion of Mentor’s $140 million authorized raise.","Community and Lifestyle, Financial Services, Food and Beverage, Health Care, Lending and Investments",1,Chet Billingsley,1-10,2,IPO,210000,USD,210000,210000,USD,210000,,,,,Public,2008-09-09,,,MNTR,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/mentor-capital-ipo--caad8908,OTCQB

PIVOT was created as an aid to both properties and brands to simplify the overly complicated landscape, while creating a more even playing field for pricing and allowing a more transparent negotiation process. By transforming and streamlining the negotiating process, PIVOT lends its clients more time to focus on their marketing platforms, creative executions and advertising opportunities presented by the hyper-sensitive and acutely aware customers we call fans. During its inception, PIVOT also saw an opportunity to simplify team travel for professional teams and large events, creating a third business vertical within the company. By offering a free 360 degree travel service, PIVOT ensures teams receive money back from their many stays throughout the season. Today, PIVOT continues to serve on those three pillars for brands looking to capitalize on fan passion, properties interested in expanding their sponsorship relationships, and teams and events looking to have their travel operation streamlined.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Commerce and Shopping, Data and Analytics, Hardware, Other, Sales and Marketing, Software",3,"Ben Shapiro, Chad E., Drew Partridge",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
