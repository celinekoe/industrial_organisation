We want this to be the first stop for serious investors who want to understand the real-world business performance of companies they own or are interested in. We agree with Warren Buffett's quote that ""Games are won by players who focus on the playing field--not by those whose eyes are glued to the scoreboard"" and hope to improve your view of what is happening on the field. We focus on providing easy access to the most important information about the financial performance of public companies. We have started with and will maintain very different emphases than other finance web sites. While they focus on links to news interpretations, other market commentary and stock price performance information, we put companies' and portfolios' financial results front and center. We will never bury you with the noise of other people's opinions. We also provide more insight into the business performance of your portfolio than other web sites. We show you the high level financial results of your piece of each company in your portfolio. As we grow, we anticipate providing additional services such as tracking this performance with your portfolio as it changes over time. We also provide access to key calculations such as return on equity, return on tangible equity and return on assets. As we grow, we may incorporate links to useful SEC filings (10K & 10Q), a small amount of historical price data useful in evaluating a company (think historical P/E, gain/loss over time for comparison with retained earnings), and perhaps links to actual company announcements,. We will also provide additional views such as rolling multi-year summaries of key financial performance data, for example five-year P/E ratios. We will also add data for foreign stocks that are currently missing because they do not file full disclosures with the SEC. Some of our derived fields may not be familiar to all users. Notable ones include Owner Earnings (net income - capital expenses + depreciation), which approximates cash flow. Tangible Equity (net assets - goodwill - intangibles), which approximates meaningful capital needed for the business. Retained earnings (net income - preferred and common dividends), which represents money not paid to shareholders as dividends, and instead reinvested into the business or used for stock re-purchases. Readers of Warren Buffett's letters will be familiar with the use and value of these calculations, although our calculations may be simplified and generalized compared to other uses in specific contexts. Looking up stocks and defining portfolios, everything on HOI today, is and will remain free. Once we are up and running, we will probably add advertising, hopefully in a useful and aesthetically pleasing format that does not interfere with your enjoyment of the site. As we grow, we may unobtrusively offer value-added capabilities such as more-sophisticated portfolio tracking or searches, but the core capabilities you see today will remain free. It is more of an aspirational name than a specific description of the current web site. In math and computer science, higher order functions take functions as input and generate new functions. We hope to take the information you choose to provide about how you invest and to help you invest well in the ways you prefer.","Financial Services, Internet Services",2,"Chris Baptist, Michael Domizioli",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

As education increases, so does tolerance and infrastructure.  Education enables the citizens of developing countries to provide better services to each other.  For example, having more well-educated doctors increases the lifespan of the populace, which increases their productivity, which increases the amount they can put into education, and the spiral goes on upwards. But if you need education to get a better economy and have better education afterwards, isn’t that a Catch 22?  It is, and is known in academia as the poverty trap.  Because a person doesn’t have enough education, he can’t earn the money to get a better education. Here is where we need to step in.  Looking at all the developing country solutions in the last decades, microfinance is definitely near the top.  Then it is natural to use this great solution to solve the education problem.  We plan to provide small loans in villages in developing countries like India, mostly to mothers, who can then afford school supplies and tuition for their children.  These loans may be long term, and will be more than paid back when their more productive children are then able to earn more. So please, join us and lift the next generation out of poverty and into enlightenment.

Also in 2013, HFC partnered with National Recording Artist, Digital Summer,  to promoted the Headbanger Brand directly to a targeted consumer. With a daily reach of 400K through social media, the partnership has driven brand awareness and sales unlike most of the industry.

The steel constructed Weed Zinger requires no bending, kneeling, or lifting. Using this eco-friendly tool allows your yard to be chemical free and your hands to stay clean.  The Weed Zinger grabs the weed and its roots from all types of soil, even heavy clay without damaging the surrounding turf or ground cover! Simply aim and ZING the weed at the target some 3-6 feet away.   The Weed Zinger is the only weeding tool that shoots the weed directly into a trash can without the need to bend over to pick-up the extracted weeds.  Simply step...twist & zing the weed away.  There currently are several stand-up weeding tools on the market, most of them are effective at removing the weed.  There are two models that we would consider our closest competition but they both require a physical force to eject the weed.  Neither product is capable of ejecting the weed directly into the waste container without applying sufficient force.  This is what makes the Weed Zinger so unique, the process of ejecting the weed directly into the waste container without a physical force is specifically what it was designed for.  Removing the weed from the ground is only half the job. At some point it is necessary to pick up the weed and place it in a waste container.  The Weed Zinger propels the weed 3-6’ statically, 10-15’ is possible with a swinging motion. At a local event, we pitched the idea to Kevin O'Leary from ABC's Shark Tank.  Mr. O’Leary remarked, “This does solve a problem; I’ve never seen anything like this. I think it has merit.  It’s a wonderful idea, it’s simple to understand, and you have orders.  Those are the cocktails for success.  That was very impressive.” We have manufacturing, sales and distribution in place.  What we need right now is funding.  The company is 100% female owned and is at the perfect place for investors.   Please help us make Weed Zinger a household name!","Hardware, Manufacturing, Science and Engineering, Software",1,Andrea Watros,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
