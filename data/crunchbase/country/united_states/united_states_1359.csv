SPOC Medical,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/spoc-medical,"Health Care, Medical, Medical Device","Stamford, Connecticut, United States",SPOC developed a clinical and technological platform with the ability to diagnose muscle pain associated with chronic diseases.,"2,648,409","East Coast, New England, Northeastern US",,Closed,2006-06-01,day,,,2012-05-20,day,For Profit,http://www.spocmedical.com,"Business Description SPOC has developed a clinical and technological platform that promises to greatly increase the accuracy with which muscle pain is diagnosed and drive down health care costs associated with chronic pain.  SPOC has set forth to capitalize on an opportunity to work with Dr. Norman Marcus, a leading pain management physician, on developing a medical device to facilitate his revolutionary method for pain diagnosis. Market: The primary market will be pain management physicians and will then expand to sports medicine, physical therapists, and fitness centers.  There will be a parallel expansion with general practitioners at a different saturation rate due to disparity in the need for pain diagnosis in routine checkups vs. the greater need by pain and physical therapists.  Ideally the SPOC device will be as common as the stethoscope in a physicianâ€™s hand.  Signaling a new era in pain diagnosis where the idea of chronic muscle pain will be virtually nonexistent. Utilizing November 2003 Bureau of Labor Statistics data an estimate for the potential U.S. market is $1.6 billion and an additional $2 billion globally, for a total potential market of $3.6 billion. Veterinary medicine is another potential market, but quantitative analysis is pending. Market Positioning: SPOC does not compete with current methods of pain diagnosis.  Instead, SPOC will enhance current methods of diagnosis and treatment. Thus, helping realize the full value of current diagnostic tools such as MRI, CT scan, X-ray standard physical examination. SPOC will compliment the pharmaceutical industry by helping doctors to properly correlate the prescription of pain killers to the correct source of pain.  This may help patients achieve lasting relief by pharmaceutics alone, rather than more drastic procedures such as surgery. Technology: SOC incorporates two technologies, one of clinical methodology and one for device technology, for a combined diagnostic package that allows for a revolution in the accuracy and precision of muscle pain diagnosis.  The first is a diagnostic method developed over 50 years by a series of key opinion leaders in pain management.  The contemporary expert in this field is Dr. Marcus whoâ€™s patented version of this methodology allows for the diagnosis of muscles in a dynamic, natural, state (as opposed to static).  This simple feature greatly increases the precision of the diagnosis while the unique methodology provides isolation of the pain generator, increasing accuracy.  The device was developed by SPOC and incorporates leading edge technology for trans-cutaneous-electroneural stimulation, a safe, effective and proven way of stimulating muscle.  The patented Dr. Marcus method and the SPOC device are inherently linked, a powerful innovation in the management of chronic pain. History: SPOC was conceived during the Fall of 2004.  Building on a successful collaboration with Dr. Marcus on October 22, 2004, SPOC developed functional prototypes that were delivered in February 2005.  Success of the initial prototypes spurred the current business development relationship between Stevens Institute of Technology ITI, SPOC and Dr. Marcus.",Health Care,3,"Jeckin Shah, Norman Marcus, M.D., Ryan M.
