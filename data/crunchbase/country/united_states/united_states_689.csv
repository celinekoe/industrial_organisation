The company is focused on becoming the technology leader in connected firearm technology for law enforcement, private security and the military.  The company‚Äôs Yardarm Platform gives organizations a new level of awareness about what‚Äôs happening with their officers‚Äô firearms. This lets commanders make informed, split second decisions about events on the ground ‚Äì decisions that can save lives, help officers in the field do their jobs better than ever, and give crime scene analysis teams the information they need after the smoke has cleared. Yardarm has developed the most sophisticated approach to firearm event tracking and awareness available in the market. The Yardarm Sensor recognizes geo-location, movement, holstering and un-holstering, the discharge of a firearm, as well as direction of fire. These events are transmitted in real-time to the Yardarm Servers (Cloud), where the data can be delivered to Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) centers or Real-Time Crime Center (RTCC) dashboards, allowing command to use this information to support officers in the field.  Custom rule-sets and provisioning tools allow commanders to establish use models that match the needs for their departments and officers. This flexibility enables a wide range of use-cases that can be applied to the sidearm an officer carries or tactical weapons used by SWAT and the military. The company‚Äôs patent pending technology delivers new levels of awareness for any organization that utilizes and manages firearms. The Yardarm solution is built on internally developed machine-to-machine (‚ÄúM2M‚Äù) technologies and applications, intellectual property, and patent-pending processes.","Government and Military, Internet Services, Privacy and Security",2,"Jim Schaff, Robert Stewart",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

There was no press release related to this event but it's assumed the company was acquired.  Sending and receiving payments through TextPayMe is easy: simply write a text message to SMS@TextPayMe.com with ""pay amount phonenumber"" in the body (i.e. to send $5 to 123-456-7890, text ""pay 5 1234567890"").

The Fund, initially capitalized by alumni donations, is guided by a Board of Directors consisting of successful entrepreneurs, VC investors, and accomplished professionals in other fields. Mission The SSVF provides a unique experiential educational opportunity for graduate level business students interested in entrepreneurship and venture investing. Student Analysts, Sr. Analysts, and Managers interact directly with entrepreneurs seeking investment, perform due diligence analysis, pitch and defend potential deals to Board members, participate in investment decisions, and are responsible for ongoing portfolio monitoring and management. Direct participation in Fund activities, operations, and management allows students to utilize and build on the skills learned in business school to produce cohesive, comprehensive, and well-reasoned analyses of potential deals - with the end goal of making sound investment decisions.  Why the Simon School Venture Fund? The SSVF leverages the capabilities of other Simon Business School student organizations and the University of Rochester's vast resources and alumni network to assist with portfolio company development. In addition to funding, SSVF‚Äôs portfolio companies can benefit from an exchange of business skills/services for real-world project experience. Whenever possible, we try to utilize available business student teams to work on ad-hoc projects that would benefit the company but may be too costly to hire out, or too time consuming for busy management teams that are already spread thin. In addition and when appropriate, we may also make valuable warm introductions to others in our extensive network to assist with other aspects of business development.
