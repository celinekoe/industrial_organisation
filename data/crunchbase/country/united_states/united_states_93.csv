Other features include the ability to visit remote locations virtually, the ability to post public Pings, and the ability to track the location of family members, who might be hidden from the main map.  The first version of the app launched in December, 2011. With virtually zero marketing the app has generated a few thousand users across all six continents. The app currently runs on iOS and Android and other platforms will be covered soon. A Pingwyn desktop application is currently in beta. It will be offered to small and medium-sized businesses, which will be able to use the map feature to track their workforce, partners and/or customers. Once merchants sign up they will have the ability to add users to their Pingwyn and track them on their merchant map.
