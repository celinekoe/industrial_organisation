Our passion has driven us to pursue perfection by acquiring extensive knowledge and research of the materials associated with the production of a custom mouthguard. Ultimately, we have eliminated the need for dental visits for a custom-made mouthguard by creating an affordable product that gives every athlete at any age the opportunity to have the best protection possible. The production of the Gladiator® -- a high-heat/pressure, multi-laminated mouthguard -- allows every Gladiator to be custom engineered for each athlete, giving them the appropriate thickness for the maximum amount of protection. Our Compliance Guarantee means it is our mission to construct the most comfortable and protective mouthguard possible. With Gladiator’s Protection Program, our streamlined ordering process eases the administrative burden on athletic trainers and coaches, while the need for replacement is almost nonexistent, as Gladiators outlast boil-and-bite mouthguards 5-to-1.
