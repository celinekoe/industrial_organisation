Agave can grow for up to 14 years before they are taken; the juice extracted from each piña, once distilled, will “rest” from 2 months to 12 years. The Old World pace of the town finds its way into every sip of tequila, a drink that in its essence is handmade. Nearly 600 kilometers away in taquerias all over La Capital an equal dedication to craft can be found at a much more bustling pace. As all cultural roads lead to Mexico City–the City of All Mexicans–ingredients from all corners of the country find their way into the taco. While preparations can be complex and exacting, the taco as a way to eat is simple and quick, the perfect match for the City’s modern speed.   At THE SAINT they believe the ideal pace for leisure draws from both worlds. It is their goal to bring a reverence for the handmade into everything that they do. Each flavor in their tacos and quesos fundidos begins in their kitchen as a raw ingredient. They make everything by hand, from scratch. They create their cocktails in the same spirit: with fresh juices, syrups and infusions that have been prepared over as many as 21 days. Every cocktail is measured by hand, every single time. As a drink, they feel tequila deserves nothing less. Welcome to THE SAINT. They hope you enjoy the finest margaritas anywhere and the best tacos north of Mexico City.

The system have been created and implemented in Israel without incorporating hydroponics. Our ambition is to correlate hydroponics into the fish farm, which would lower the cost of expensive filtration systems while adding a secondary income to the program. One of the key people involved has successfully built aquaculture systems in Israel as a primary engineer on the projects. These systems are successfully breeding and producing fish at the level that is described in this business plan. Other key personal have also worked on these aquaculture farms, but at the time it was not a thought to introduce hydroponics to the system. By connecting aquaculture and hydroponics in a symbiotic relationship, we are able to filter the waste water, removing ammonia, nitrites, and fish waste creating a bio-filter and recycling the water back into the tanks. These systems can be utilized to breed Shrimp, and fish simultaneously or separately. The cost of operating aqua farm varies. Our operation requires funds of up to 20,000,000 dollars for build out and operations. Presently the population of fish is dwindling to catastrophic proportions. There is a growing gap between how many fish are available to be caught and humanity’s desire to catch them, a problem that gets worst as population explodes.  The journal Science published a four year study in November of 2006, which predicted that, at prevailing trends the world would run out of wild caught seafood in 2048. These scientists stated that the decline is a result of overfishing, pollution and other environmental factors. The company’s goal is to provide naturally bred fish and shrimp free of chemicals and, including mercury, at fair market value. These systems can be created in any climate or environment free of commercial utilities by adding natural wind power if need be.","Agriculture and Farming, Travel and Tourism",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
