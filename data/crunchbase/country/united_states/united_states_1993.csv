A few weeks later, the brothers launched a simple email program that delivered relevant content to past and prospective clients. The brothers were asked by a Keller Williams office manager to create an email program that could be used to attract new agent recruits to the rapidly growing market center. After lengthy internal discussions and several rounds of prototypes, they decided to shift gears and instead pitched a regularly updated website with multi-layered lead generation from online job boards, SEO, and social networking. On January 1st, 2010, REDcareers was officially launched. In just three short years, REDcareers has generated over 350,000 leads for 370 market centers and is now the #1 source of online leads for Keller Williams Realty.In the wake of their success with REDcareers, the brothers decided to embark on their most ambitious mission to date—reinventing the Realtor website. WBI, now equipped with some of the most talented designers, developers, and coders in the world, created WingWire—the first-ever website that writes itself. Each week, custom blog articles are automatically delivered to the agent’s site, sent out as an e-newsletter, and posted as status updates to the agent’s social networking pages. WingWire sites contain the most sophisticated array of market data, MLS listings, and area information available to Realtors today. In 2011, WingWire was officially launched as a free, automatic upgrade to all existing email program clients. Since then, WingWire has exploded in popularity and functionality and is the preferred website solution for hundreds of brokerages and agents throughout the country.","Advertising, Real Estate, Sales and Marketing, Software",2,"Casey Wright, Corey Wright",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

This evolution of technology led to a series of acquisitions for Netrepid, and the company found itself evolving into more of an IT Services provider. In 2009, Netrepid acquired Pennsylvania Online, an Internet service provider originally founded in 1993. This acquisition provided the start of an established data center, call center, and support teams for Netrepid. In 2011, Netrepid acquired GameChanger Technology and the following year, Netrepid also acquired Lion Technologies. Both acquisitions allowed Netrepid the opportunity to increase its capabilities in the area of managed IT services for residents and small businesses in the Central PA-area.  Today, Netrepid provides enterprise class infrastructure hosting services for a large variety of industries including the professional services industry, manufacturers, transportation and logistics providers, and companies involved in all areas of the supply chain.
