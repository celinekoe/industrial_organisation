Spyryx's product leverages the mechanism discovered by Dr. Tarran and has shown promising results in preclinical studies by dramatically increasing survival in an animal model of CF.  Their product's action is independent of the genetic mutations that cause CF, thereby having the potential to provide disease-modifying therapy to the entire CF patient population. Dr. Tarran's laboratory has also demonstrated a connection between this fluid regulation mechanism and the dehydration seen in COPD patients, who suffer from severe, chronic bronchitis and emphysema.

The Watch SDK, a Web3 data infrastructure toolkit for deploying and querying data from connected chains, is among the first developer toolkits built on top of the Timechain. To enhance the overall UX when it comes to querying blockchain data, the Analog team has implemented a low-code and intuitive platform called the Watch UI that runs on top of the Watch SDK called the Watch UI.

Thirty years of research in topological dimension theory led to the discovery of a novel geometry, the “4WEB”, which could be used as a building block to create high-strength, lightweight web structures. Mr. Hunt took advantage of this breakthrough, along with cutting-edge 3D printing technology, to develop the 4WEB Medical proprietary implant platform. The 4WEB geometry optimizes multidisciplinary engineering principles such as truss design, load transfer and adjacent material reaction to produce orthopedic implants that actively participate in the healing process. The company’s truss designs are built to provide superior strength and promote osseous incorporation, guiding bone formation through structural mechanics rather than through the use of expensive biologics. 4WEB’s initial focus was on the spine implant market but it soon became clear the 4WEB truss implant technology could be used as a broad platform to develop an array of products across the entire orthopedic arena. The designs can be applied to any orthopedic procedure requiring structural support where the patient will benefit from optimal porosity and osseous incorporation. The 4WEB product portfolio offers comprehensive surgical solutions to neurosurgeons, orthopedic spine surgeons, and foot and ankle surgeons.","Health Care, Manufacturing",1,Jessee Hunt,11-50,3,,,USD,,900000,USD,900000,"SWK Holdings, National Science Foundation",2,2,,Private,,,,,,

After dermal administration, these modified vesicles deliver both immunostimulatory proteins and an array of patient-specific tumor-membrane antigens simultaneously to the immune system.

As of fall 2018, the company represents over 2,500 air taxi aircraft across the US, Canada and the Caribbean.  Early on, the company entered into key partnerships with meta travel search sites Kayak and Hipmunk, demonstrating significant top of funnel demand and favorable customer acquisition cost.  Since then, the company has invested in extending its demand generation capabilities to legacy reservation systems used by the airlines to sell through online and traditional travel agents.  These include Amadeus, SABRE and Travelport, dramatically increasing the company's top of funnel capabilities.  Linear Air Taxi’s business model is similar to other participants in the shared economy in that it owns the technology platform, and its operating partners own the aircraft.    Air taxi supply is fragmented and underutilized. The traditional booking process for air taxis is difficult, manual and inefficient. Linear Air's technology pioneered the provision of information on air taxi flights over an online platform to enable real time booking, fare quotes, secure payments, and customer support. Linear Air has also been successful in getting air taxi flights listed on travel sites such as Kayak and Hipmunk, and now, the systems used by the airlines to distribute through online and traditional travel agents. The technology platform provides many benefits for air taxi operating partners as well.  Primary uses of additional funding will be development of a mobile platform, expansion of demand generation marketing activities, and addition of features to benefit the company's air taxi operating partners, including the opportunity to participate in the nascent Urban Air Mobility market for ultra-short hops of 20-100 miles.   Two of the principals, Bill Herp, CEO, and Bart Littlefield, SVP of Operations and Business Development, have had successful exits from venture backed companies and significant travel tech experience. Bill founded online marketing technology provider e-Dialog , which was sold for $157 million, and Mr. Littlefield has led and been a member of the executive team of a number of travel tech companies, including e-Travel, which was acquired by Oracle and subsequently Amadeus.","Commerce and Shopping, Community and Lifestyle, Other, Software, Travel and Tourism",1,Bill Herp,11-50,6,Seed,3104509,USD,3104509,3104509,USD,3104509,,,,,Private,,,,,,
