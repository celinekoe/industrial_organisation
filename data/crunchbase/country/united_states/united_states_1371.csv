ShareMagnet,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sharemagnet,"Advertising, Direct Marketing, E-Commerce, Social Media Advertising","Manhattan Beach, California, United States",ShareMagnet offers rewards for individuals recommending and referring products and services to others across social networks.,"521,356","Greater Los Angeles Area, West Coast, Western US",,Active,2010-04-28,day,,,,,For Profit,http://www.sharemagnet.com,"ShareMagnet, rewards customers for recommending and referring products and services to their friends and family across social networks.  Co-founded in 2010 by Thomas Larkin and Benjamin Stewart, the Company is focused on harnessing the social media power of companies’ best advertisers – their customers. Our guiding axiom is that word of mouth is the most trusted and effective form of all advertising. We believe that actual customers are the best marketers and, therefore, companies should hire them.  Retailers recognize this fact, however, the significant pain in the market has been how to effectively harness the power of word of mouth, track its ROI, and create a repeatable engagement structure.   ShareMagnet’s application Social Rebate incentivizes customers to share products and brands on social networks after a purchase is made. This allows for effective tracking of word of mouth efforts and clearly shows the ROI. Through a simple back-end integration, requiring no up-front fees and limited time commitment for most Ecommerce sites, customers are given the opportunity to rebate their purchase by sharing and promoting what they just bought with their online friends.  The application is fully integrated into all major social networks, including, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest, and allows customers to login and post to their preferred social media site.  Each click of the link made by friends and family in the network rebates a portion of the original purchase back to the original customer.  The technology has a butterfly effect; secondary and tertiary purchasers can post a rebate link, too, which allows the client retailer to promote to a larger network and rebate additional customers. To date, SocialRebate has impressively shown over a 15% conversion rate for rebates posted to social media sites for participating brands.  This revenue is incremental to existing marketing and customer acquisition efforts, and only costs a client (defined as a retailer who has integrated SocialRebate onto its ecommerce platform) when a purchase has been made.  SocialRebate is currently installed with 100 clients, has processed over 20,000 transactions, has a 15% participation rate on referrals, and has currently developed software to integrate with the top ecommerce software platforms.  The retention rate for integrated clients is over 90% and on the customer side each new rebate claimed is a new registered user waiting to be re-targeted to or syndicated. Additionally, an estimated 20% of revenue generated has been from pre-purchases of Share Magnets, including brands such as MySpace, Care.com, National Positions, Okabashi and Gazelle.com.","Advertising, Commerce and Shopping, Sales and Marketing",2,"Benjamin Stewart, Tom Lakin",11-50,2,Seed,500000,USD,500000,500000,USD,500000,Mike Schell,,1,,Private,,,,,,

Our goal at Crate & Cannabis is to change the way the Cannabis Industry & Culture are viewed, while making big waves in the Home Goods & Tourism Sectors.  When C & C started it had a small menu of six Cannabis Gift Baskets, at the time we had no idea where it would lead. During the first two months C & C was able to sell close to $50,000.00 in Cannabis Gift Crates with only a small seed investment. It was at that point we took a step back and took the time to speak with our customers, gathering as much feedback and data as possible. Over the following two months as we analyzed our data, the future of C & C started to take shape. We utilized the new and growing regulations coupled with customer data, to find the best financial growth model for the company, then C & C’s was born.  The future for C & C is bright and the path has been laid to make C & C the Cannabis destination to visit in California, soon after worldwide. The Cannabis community focuses so much on Cannabis yet not enough on bringing consumers to the sector. Truly nothing has been done like this before, when we get it right, no one will be able to compete. There will be some amazing changes coming down the pipeline and we are exited to share them with you.  Crate & Cannabis will be expanding its product line in a big way during 2019, even more exciting news, C & C will be opening a brick and mortar location, to act as a destination for the Cannabis Community & Culture.  A Destination which will include; Flagship C & C Home ~ A Furniture & Home Decor Store, 2nd “C” ~ A Cannabis Store / Dispensary, & Konoponoření ~ A Cannabis Restaurant.

A great auto transport lead consists of a trucking company that specializes in shipping cars from point A to point B. This type of transporter usually charges a flat rate based on a distance traveled. They generally only ship vehicles between cities. However, they may offer interstate shipping services in some cases. The best auto transport leads are those that generate multiple phone calls per week from potential clients looking to ship their car(s). Car shipping leads are generated from various sources including classifieds websites, local newspapers, magazines, and even social media websites. They are usually used to generate quality traffic to your website. This kind of lead generation is usually done through paid advertising campaigns. However, auto transport leads are still considered to be one of the best types of leads. They are usually sent directly to the car shipper through CRM, email or phone calls. Car shipping leads are a great lead generation tool for car dealerships. They are a great way to generate qualified leads for your dealership. When someone buys a vehicle from you they usually want to ship their old vehicle back home. This means that they are going to need to transport their vehicle to their home. This is where car shipping leads come into play. With this type of lead, you can contact the person and offer to ship their vehicle back to them at a discounted rate. Car transport leads are generated when a potential client contacts you wanting to transport their vehicle. This could be anywhere around the world. Once you contact the person and explain what you do, you can offer them transportation services at a discounted price. A car transport lead is generated when a potential buyer wants to transport their vehicle to a different location. This could be anywhere in the world. So, when someone buys a vehicle from your dealership, they may decide to transport it somewhere else. This means that they will need to hire a trucking company to move their vehicle. This is where car transport leads come into play. You can contact the person and ask them if they would like to transport their vehicle. Then, you can offer them a discounted price to do so.",Transportation,,,10001+,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
