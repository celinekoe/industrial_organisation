They believe the resources of philanthropy should be accessible to all, not just to those with the right connections, and they seek to explain the world of giving in ways that anyone can understand. If you're looking for funds to support your work, they can help.  They are also committed to bringing more transparency and accountability to philanthropy at a time that it's having a growing impact on America and the world. While today's rising tide of generosity is a good thing, and they write often about smart and creative funders, they raise tough questions about the role of private money in public life.  They always write about funders in a respectful and thoughtful way. They expect their community to also be respectful. If all that sounds useful, become a subscriber. Digging into the world of foundations and donors is expensive. The more subscribers they have, the deeper they can dig. Inside Philanthropy has never taken money from the funders they cover and never will.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment",1,David Callahan,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
