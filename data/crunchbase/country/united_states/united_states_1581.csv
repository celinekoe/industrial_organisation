Yes, we share documents with each other and we collaborate on projects, but when it comes down to it, we are each responsible for our own specific set of tasks. Thatâ€™s what Cohuman is: a Task Network, where people create and share tasks. Each task is a container holding all the information you need: documents, followers, dates, dependencies and more. What makes Cohuman unique is that it organizes each task in a person or project list in order of priority. Lastly, intelligent permission settings allow team members to view shared task lists. Think of it as live status reports of everyone on your team and every project you work on. FOCUS - Tasks are prioritized so people can focus on doing the most important things first. FACETED TRANSPARENCY - Team members have visibility into each othersâ€™ Tasks. Sophisticated privacy controls determine what each person can see.
