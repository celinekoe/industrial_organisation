The people behind Shop My Power have over 20 years experience in the energy industry. Shop My Power is a free, non biased comparison tool which assembles all of the electricity and gas providers in your area based on zip code. At the click of a button, Shop My Power displays all the different plans in your zip code, sorted by whatever features are important to you, whether that be price, a fixed or variable rate, or if that company uses green power to supply your energy such as wind, solar, hydro etc. Shop My Power takes all the frustration and confusion out of shopping for the best electricity or gas rates. Finding just the right provider for you can be even more difficult than finding the right auto insurance company. In Auto insurance most people know who many of the major providers are such as State Farm, Allstate, Farmers, and Geico among others. Even knowing who the players are you still have to take the time to call every one of them to get the best plan and coverage for you. It can be exhausting. With Electricity companies, other than your default provider such as TXU or Reliant, many people are just not familiar with the dozens of other excellent electricity or gas companies available to them, and in some cases each electricity company can have over a dozen different plans to choose from. There could be more than 200 different electricity plans available in your area! How can you possibly know which plan is right for you when you compare electricity rates? Knowing this the creators of Shop My Power designed a comprehensive and extremely user friendly (even for those who do not normally use the Internet for research) comparison tool that in less than 30 seconds can narrow hundreds of available plans down to just a few based on what is important to you and displays them in an easy to read format that is clear, concise, and understandable. There are other resources on the web, but none have all the capabilities that Shop My Power does... AND IT'S FREE!","Energy, Sustainability",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

We gather and analyze it for you. We build your feedback loops so you can build your product. 1. We conduct customer interviews All of our feedback is gathered in 1-on-1 conversations with customers. We ask open-ended questions, encourage honest and extended responses, and we listen. When people feel free to share their experiences with your product openly and honestly, they often reveal crucial information about what's not working, uncover costly blind spots that exist within your product and team, and reveal needs that you may not have realized they are relying on your product to meet. 2. We record and upload the interviews to our platform There is a time for analysis, and a time for listening. We converse with customers without notes in an effort to follow the customer’s line of thought to its end. Recording and uploading the interviews centralizes them for focused analysis later. Having those moments captured permanently for future study allows all stakeholders to see the moments as they happen, and discuss and debate them until teams reach an optimal solution. 3. We study the interviews and identify patterns We organize key points from multiple interviews into common themes. Then we mine this data to identify patterns in how your customers engage with your product. Because these interviews are centralized, your team is welcome to jump into the analysis with us, or just review the insights we deliver. 4. We deliver insights As we see patterns rising from the qualitative data, we build cases around what trends are emerging, culminating in an Insight. These insights are supported by specific moments from the interviews. They are unique and nuanced realities about your customers’ perspectives, and they are the missing information your team needs to build a great product.
