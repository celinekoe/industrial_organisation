Today, cloud-based AI and big data systems face significant challenges but aren’t equipped to meet them head-on. Data privacy has emerged as a global concern, but AI systems utilizing big data simply can’t preserve privacy while learning. Similarly, in a world where IoT and device data outpace the speed of bandwidth growth, latency in AI data processing is causing avoidable bottlenecks.  TieSet has developed STADLE, a Scalable Traceable Adaptive Distributed Learning platform with a core feature of decentralized federated learning that preserves privacy while collecting and maximizing intelligence to be shared. Because intelligence is created and trained locally on edge devices to be gathered by STADLE, our platform generates high-quality intelligence without uploading data, enabling AI systems to operate and perform at scale while offline. Our message is simple. Collect, maximize and share the intelligence around the world. That is the world TieSet envisions for the next generation of technologies, for which we call the Internet of Intelligence (IoI) where intelligence is the one that is mainly exchanged over the Internet, not just raw private data.

The robot provides the physical sensors and actuators, we implement an autonomy software module to govern its behavior corresponding with its use-case, and we attach a tool for a specific mission. For our short-term plan, we are developing a robot that can navigate safely along a commercial corridor sidewalk while pulling a power sweeper. While our first target is combating litter, this modular approach with a focus on outdoor navigation allows for this robot to be used in numerous other cases. Swap out the power sweeper for a lawn mower or seeder and you can do largescale lawncare. Add in a painting attachment and you can paint lines on a set of athletic fields and take care of all their landscaping needs.

We allow listeners to pick one song per day that they believe could become a future hit. In addition, we track all listener behavior (skips, plays, upvotes, downvotes, etc.) internally and sign the best songs based on these metrics to exclusive publishing deals with our partner Spirit Music Group, starting to monetize those songs by placing them in film, TV, ads and other royalty generating media. Music lovers who placed their bets on the right song will own a token of that song, generating royalties alongside every other stakeholder in the song or being able to trade and sell the token via marketplaces.  Artists who don't have a professional recording of their songs can utilize our online recording studio to record their music with some of the best session musicians in the world at studio quality at a low cost.

Nonetheless, the company is focused on first prosecuting the circuit board (PCB) industry opportunity, before addressing others.    Currently, the PCB industry predominantly employs a """"subtractive"""" manufacturing method, which is highly labor and process intensive, produces poor yields at finer geometries and is limited in shape (flat only) and number of compatible substrates. Accordingly, advanced micro-electronics designs are increasingly cost-prohibitive and """"no-bid"""" projects are becoming more and more common. The subtractive method is very caustic to the environment and the waste by product is expensive to mitigate. Furthermore, an antiquated process makes for a heavily commoditized market with extremely low margins.    Enter eSurface, a fully additive process. Manufacturing is simpler and more efficient, with far fewer processing steps. Yields are higher, even in multiples, for much finer and far more complex PCB designs. Labor usage and space requirements are reduced by multiples. Finally, as a result of these improvements, production costs are projected to descend by 50% or more.    Additionally, eSurface enables enhanced signal integrity, due to far tighter tolerances, expanded material selections, allowing plating of circuits on practically any material and shape, including 3D surfaces.    Also, there is vast improvement in adhesion of metal to substrate and, lastly, important environmental benefits via a closed loop process, radically reducing toxic waste. All of these improvements make for significant advances in microelectronics.    The eSurface business model is to license its technology to manufacturers for a royalty fee.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Manufacturing, Science and Engineering",,,11-50,2,,9553000,USD,9553000,9553000,USD,9553000,,,,,Private,,,,,,
