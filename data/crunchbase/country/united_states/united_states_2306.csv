Internal IT resources are often not up to the task of re-invigorating a company’s IT strategy. While they might possess tremendous domain expertise and understand existing systems inside and out, they often need help to drive new ways of doing things. We were built by a team of software and industry executives to help companies big and small Step Up and create new rules of competition through IT.

Finally, at the end of January 1958, a stunned United States became the second nation to place an object in orbit when it successfully launched the Explorer 1 satellite. Out of this traumatic experience of technological surprise in the first moments of the Space Age, U.S. leadership created DARPA, initially with the shorter name Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). In the nearly 60 years since it was established, DARPA has owned the critical mission of keeping the United States out front when it comes to cultivating breakthrough technologies for national security rather than in a position of catching up to strategically important innovations and achievements of others. With no research and development facilities of its own, DARPA has become known as a laboratory and incubator of innovation by providing thought leadership, community-building frameworks, technology challenges, research management, funding, and other cultural and infrastructural support elements that it takes to usher transformative ideas toward consequential new realities.","Government and Military, Information Technology, Other",1,Dwight D.
