Networks today are constantly evolving and boast several novel features such as “always-on,” cloud-enabled applications, and IoT. However, enterprises have not been able to fully benefit from commoditization and advances in networking, notably use of 10 or 100 Gig interfaces. This is primarily due to insufficient APIs for extracting information from devices thus forcing a lock on custom network automation and reducing network diversity. Other reasons include limited flexibility over time from outsourcing to a managed services vendor, inadequate skills and training for employees.  Switchnomix addresses these limitations using modern technological features and analytics for business growth.  Switchnomix LENS is designed to process large amounts of telemetry data in real time from hundreds of thousands of network elements. The data is used to provide relevant business outcomes, specific visualizations, detect anomalies, and even push policies to control network elements in real time. LENS dashboards are also standardized for easy consumption. Built on LENS, Switchnomix Cloud securely gathers network information from switches directly. Moreover, the technology utilizes standardized protocols to collect, monitor and control relevant network data in real time from commercially available off-the-shelf switches including Cisco, Allied Telesis, HPE Aruba, and even white boxes running Open vSwitch – without changes to their firmware or breaking warranty. Switchnomix Cloud automatically adapts to network switch changes, so an upgrade or downgrade is uncomplicated and fast. This also means you don’t need agents, neither do you have to install any other hardware or software. Businesses can, therefore, easily replace a 1 Gig switch with a 100 Gig switch without changes to their software or likewise, downgrade from 100 Gig to 10 Gig.  Besides, you don’t need to keep track of vendor APIs. Switchnomix LENS technology automatically collects real-time data and translates it into understandable visuals on the cloud console. The facility for data visualization, including LENS dashboards, are pre-built by Switchnomix in-house data scientists and are instantly available for use with no extra programming or maintenance.  To benefit from this nirvana of network management and flexibility, customers do need to use some latest hardware from Cisco like Catalyst 9000 series, Allied Telesis, HPE Aruba and a few other vendors.  Switch port capacities can be from 1Gig to 100 Gig as of today.  We have plans for 400 Gigs too.  Your existing network topology and deployments will work.  As with any situation, you can only have one manager - so, choosing Switchnomix Cloud will mean that you will not be able to use your existing tools .  You will be able to get that functionality in an easy way from our cloud.  Let’s assume that you need a particular business metric or outcome that we don’t have, then you just have to provide us the use case and we will deliver the same in a generalized and standardized way  - there is no coding  required from your side.  In terms of pricing, we charge a very transparent $250 per month for 100 Gig of data that we process in our cloud with no terms or contracts.  This means that you can subscribe for 1 month and walk away or come back for only one month every quarter to check on your network - your choice.  You can connect 1 or 100,000 switches or interfaces but, we charge you by data sent to our cloud.  Our onboarding process is very simple - it takes less than an hour to activate your tenant and less than 30 minutes to on-board a switch. In summary, Switchnomix provides you the ability to innovate while you securely operate your networks with a consumption model flexibility that is desired.","Information Technology, Privacy and Security, Software",1,Shivaram Mysore,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
