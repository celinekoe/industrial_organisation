Although many people consider being fit purely physical, they are wrong.  Being physically fit is very important but it is difficult to do so without becoming mentally fit.   â€œFor the first time ever, overweight people outnumber average people in America. Doesn't that make overweight the average then? Last month you were fat, now you're average - hey, let's get a pizza!â€ â€“ Jay Leno Although people find humor in the unhealthy lifestyles people often lead, poor nutrition, overeating , eating disorders, and stress have become a very big problem when  it comes to weight and health.  Obesity rates have been reaching epidemic proportions in the US.  Eight out of ten people over the age of 25 is overweight.     Because of this horrifying statistic, there have been more and more efforts to counteract the unhealthy life.   Many people have found a passion in taking pride in oneâ€™s health and getting and staying fit as difficult as it may be.  There have been magazines that have tried spreading the message to the public as well as reality/competition shows that would do the same.  And now with the boom of technology, it is time for this common goal to be seen on the web.  ExerShare was first launched in September 2009.  Its founders created ExerShare as a user-content driven hub for health and fitness professionals and the general public to both post and access exercise, nutrition and other health-related Content.  Content includes videos, articles, workout plans, nutrition plans, and a discussion forum. Instead of searching numerous websites searching for different articles on nutrition, then searching through multiple websites for a how-to video for Pilates and Yoga, then searching for a good discussion forum to talk about the best way to lift weights, ExerShare hopes to save people the effort making it even easier for them to choose to live a healthy, fit life.  By creating a home for all those who exercise in different ways, professionals and the public learn many different tips from others while simultaneously teaching others by posting content they created themselves or found useful.","Community and Lifestyle, Health Care, Media and Entertainment, Sports, Video",1,Ryan Burger,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

PS Mobile Tech has developed AccelSelect™, a groundbreaking graphical user interface and method for positioning a selection and selecting within notes, documents, spreadsheets, presentations, lists of items, and arrays of items on mobile phones, tablets, and mobile digital electronic devices. Multiple patents have been filed. The AccelSelect UI and method offers the user the simplicity, performance, and accessibility that previously has only been available on notebooks and desktops.  QuickSelect™ solves the problem that current solutions for positioning the cursor or selecting text to correct errors or edit entered text are a major source of frustration for mobile device users.  Current solutions do not offer the performance and usability users expect from their experience using a mouse or touch pad on their desktop or notebook. The current leading solution on phones and tablets is direct manipulation of drag handles attached to the cursor or selection start and end points. This solution supports simple tasks such as selection of a single word or an entire content, but does not support quick selection of a character, group of characters, or group of words.  In addition, this solution does not perform well near the edge of the display.  The alternative solution is indirect manipulation with gestures on the keyboard operating as a virtual touchpad.  This solution has a number of shortcomings:  (1) mode errors which result from using the keyboard for two different purposes, (2) different implementations on different devices (e.g. using two fingers on a tablet vs. force-touch on a phone), and (3) applicability limited to editable text (because the keyboard is required), requiring the drag handle solution for read-only text. We have developed a new on-screen solution (QuickSelect™) for positioning the cursor and selecting text on mobile devices with touch-sensitive displays.  QuickSelect™ eliminates the problems inherent with the current solutions.  Specifically, our new solution:  (1) enables users to quickly, easily, and accurately select not only a single word or an entire content, but also a character, group of characters, or group of words, (2) performs equally well at any location on the display ranging from near the center of the display to near the edge of the display, (3) operates identically across all platforms, including phones and tablets, (4) provides an on-screen control for positioning the cursor and selecting text which is equivalent in performance and accessibility to mouse and touchpad solutions on desktops and notebooks.","Information Technology, Mobile, Software",2,"David Boyers, Gordon Mitchard",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
