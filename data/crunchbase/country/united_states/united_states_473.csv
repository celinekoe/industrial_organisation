Our products, such as the Wireless Pneumatic Thermostat, Wireless Gauge Reader or Wireless Steam Trap Monitor, require minutes to install, cost a fraction of traditional solutions, and typically pay back within 18 months. THE CHALLENGE Managers at older facilities must often tolerate dated legacy technologies such as pneumatic thermostats, mechanical steam traps, and manual gauges. Compared to new state-of-the art plants or buildings, these sites typically consume more energy, require more maintenance labor, incur higher unplanned downtime, and deliver lower yield or productivity. In today’s competitive business environment, these factors put older facilities at a serious disadvantage. Although many plant and building operators would like to upgrade their facilities with the latest automation technology, the cost of running new wires, disrupting existing occupants or production, and triggering potential safety code upgrades makes it unfeasible. As an operator of existing manufacturing plants and buildings in over a dozen sites worldwide, Cypress understands these challenges first hand.","Energy, Manufacturing, Other, Real Estate",1,Harry Sim,51-100,1,Seed,465850,USD,465850,465850,USD,465850,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Look inside many wallets of U.S. citizens and you will find a drivers license that was made with the help of Spartanics high precision Die Cutting Systems for decorated plastic material and/or Spartanics automated Card Inspection Systems. Look inside the wallets of others and you might find voter ID cards, telephone cards, loyalty/gift cards, and a majority of insurance cards, which were similarly created and counted with Spartanics technology. Look elsewhere and find product packaging, appliance nameplates, electroluminescent watch faces and mobile phone panels, playing cards, folding maps, parking lot hangtags, hotel “DO NOT DISTURB” signs, refrigerator magnets, and more—all made with the aid of Spartanics equipment. Within the past five years, we introduced technology for Laser Die Cutting and roll-to-roll Screen Printing Lines allowing us to further broaden our reach in the printing and converting markets. New technology for Laser Die Cutting, paired with digital printing systems or converting lines, gives Spartanics further reach into many label markets including pharmaceutical and consumer product labels. Our screen printing technology is serving RFID label markets, portable electronics and photonics or solar film markets While consumers remain unaware of the Spartanics name, the world’s leading manufacturers of products made from polyesters, paper, polypropylene, polycarbonate, aluminum and other materials are likely to think of their Spartanics equipment as a secret trade advantage. From circuit boards to automobile trim, to insurance cards to financial and smart cards, to labels to photonics and beyond, Spartanics high precision technology is often the unseen hand in speeding production processes across the globe.
