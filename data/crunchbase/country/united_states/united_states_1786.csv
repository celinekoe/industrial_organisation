Wood based products are cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and perform as good as or better than the oil based materials being used today. Although the founders of RCE come together through diverse backgrounds, each has a goal to reduce environmental problems faced by the world due to coal power. Founding members of RCE bring 2 together a wealth of knowledge and networks they will utilize to grow RCE to an innovative leader in the field of wood product specialty manufacturing.   RCE creates client specific products through; development and analysis of client needs, consulting with industry experts on effective processes for maximum product benefits, and applying tried and true methods of manufacturing technology. RCE processes renewable biomass through a patented calciner which de-volatizes the material, thereby producing sufficient thermal energy to achieve the process with minimal external energy needed to perpetuate the cycle. Depending on the client needs the carbon that is left behind is manipulated for specific market requirements. The products RCE is capable of producing is far reaching through multiple market segments and represents several billion dollars in revenue. The growth rates in our chosen markets are projected to be in the double digits for the next several years.

Submit your press releases, brand stories, and social media distribution to grow your business. Start using brand storytelling through pr. KissPR is a leading Dallas-based cutting edge digital disruption company that was founded in 2003 by Qamar Zaman in Grand Cayman of the Cayman Islands and started as an idea on a napkin in his local coffee shop Cafe Del Sol in Grand Cayman. ​After 18 months, Hurricane Ivan destroyed the Cayman Islands on September 12, 2004. Qamar barely lived through the destructive hurricane that obliterated the island. Unable to stay in Grand Cayman while the Islands were rebuilding, Qamar relocated to Dallas, TX leaving behind losses and a heavy heart. Now in Dallas, Qamar began to tell his story of struggle and how he survived the Category 6 hurricane — surrounded by tornados and stuck in a home that was drowning in the ocean — to his new friends in Texas. He was soon being asked to tell his survival story anywhere he went. As he told people, he realized that his story was starting to resonate with people and this is when Zaman realized his truest passion: storytelling. ​After surviving the near-death experience in Grand Cayman, Zaman decided to begin his new storytelling journey from a small, windowless office in Addison, TX a suburb of Dallas, TX. That little company has now become KissPR. Fast forward 18 years, we are still telling stories. Stories of struggles, success, and achievements, except we are not the heroes of these stories, our clients and customers are. These stories have transformed personal and business brands around the world by telling their stories through storytelling. KissPR has now told over 28,000 stories and counting and continues helping small businesses dreams become reality. ​KissPR CEO and our team of storytellers have partnered to create a new kind of platform Brand Stories www.BrandStories.Buzz and partnered with some of the top news, pr, and social story distributions to help amplify and grow small brands. ​Over 500 Top News Distribution Websites ​Qamar Zaman spent several years perfecting relationships with top influencers in the area of legal, business, health sciences and technology and works with elite law firms and business entities to lead them to exponential gains. ​KissPR continues to provide clients with a growing list of benefits that help them save time and money as a guide and digital transformation consultant.","Content and Publishing, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Sales and Marketing",2,"Qamar Zaman, Qamar Zaman",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
