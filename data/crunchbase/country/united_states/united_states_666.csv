Filmmortal is essentially a marketplace for indie filmmakers and advertisers to bid on each otherÃ¢â¬â¢s proposals. The startup's main goal is to help talented filmmakers and future Cannes, Sundance or even Oscar darlings - get funding for their dream projects (both movies and TV shows). Some of the best films and shows of our times were indie projects; being rejected by major studios and later on gaining cult and even pop-culture status! The advertisers get a chance to place or integrate their products in upcoming movies and shows; this could be in the form of the product being shown or used in the movie during emotionally engaging scenes, or perhaps even integrated into the storyline. There is also the possibility of barter arrangements between the two parties where the advertisers provide things like crew transport, hotel stays, catering, props, equipment etc. in exchange for having their products placed in the project.  These kinds of deals were previously done behind closed doors; between privileged ad agencies and major movie studios. Filmmortal makes the entire process simple, transparent and fast (both parties being notified in the inboxes or on their BlackberryÃ¢â¬â¢s whenever a new project is listed; or whenever their proposals are bid on or finalized). For film buffs a special section called ""BRANDSPOTTERS"" which is a massive database of every product placement in every film from 2000-2009. They can do a live Ajax search using either film or brand and it will show what film or what brand was featuref in what movie. Anything missing from the database, BRANDSPOTTERS can Ã¢â¬Åsuggest or addÃ¢â¬Â. Top BRANDSPOTTERS will have the chance to be in upcoming movies, receive special edition dvdÃ¢â¬â¢s, attend premieres, film festival screenings etc.","Advertising, Sales and Marketing",1,Sahil Kazi,1-10,3,Seed,155000,USD,155000,155000,USD,155000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

When I was nine years old, I created a surround sound system for my bedroom by attaching random speakers I had pulled out of broken radio's into a Zenith AM/FM radio. My family still pokes fun about the UHF antennae I made using wood and wire hangers. AV Solutions was created to fulfill my lifelong dream of working with technology and electronics. The ""solutions"" part of the name incorporates my vision of providing the solution to any ""audio and video"" want or need that our customers desire. Whether creating total home automation, the home theater of your dreams, or upgrading or troubleshooting existing equipment - AV Solutions is the answer. AV Solutions has grown by word of mouth and referrals with no advertising. A prestigious home theater company in Atlanta frequently refers their customers to us, which has also added to our strong growth.","Hardware, Media and Entertainment, Software, Video",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Compared to for-profit businesses, nonprofits face significant double standards when it comes to overhead expenditure. Most donors have a visceral aversion to overheads, wanting a majority of their donation to go directly to the cause and not towards compensation, advertising & marketing spend, investment in IT and innovation etc. Sadly, this 'Overhead Myth' is crippling the nonprofit sector, stagnating innovation and destroying growth potential. âIt seems counterintuitive that the very organizations that have altruistically committed themselves to making the world a better place, are often constrained from maximally doing so! âWe empower nonprofits to break free from the ""The Nonprofit Starvation Cycle"" by providing services that help them not just to survive, but to grow! Rather than handouts, we provide leg-ups in areas that they need it most.  Here's how it works: 1) Consumers purchase products from our ecommerce partners 2) A set percentage from each sale is paid by these businesses to Virtueconomy 3) âWe then convert those funds into valuable services for the matched nonprofit partner As a male founder, it was important to me to become an ally and stand up for the gender inequality that continues to persist in the business world.  As such, Virtueconomy's initial focus is on Women Empowerment -- We create shared value by matching female founded enterprises with relevant nonprofits that empower, educate and uplift women.","Community and Lifestyle, Hardware, Information Technology, Internet Services, Social Impact, Software",1,Keith Friedlander,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
