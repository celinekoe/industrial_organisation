Their mission began in 2014 when they were awarded a grant by the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center (MassCEC) to develop a way to inject highly insulating closed cell polyurethane foam into  ""under-insulated"" fiberglass filled wall cavities. Since then, they have further developed and refined their pinhole insulation technology through additional grants from the MassCEC, the US Department of Energy and CertainTeed/Saint Gobain. The results have been phenomenal. They can fill an entire wall cavity through one easily patched 1/2” hole and can insulate an entire house in just one day. In a typical 1950's era fiberglass insulated wall, their technology increases insulation values from R10 to R23 and has been demonstrated to reduce energy usage by 25% or more. They're currently expanding their pinhole insulation technology to cathedral ceilings, dormer roofs and flat roofs. THey're also developing safer alternatives to traditional spray foam for use in new construction, roof rafters and other open cavity applications. When fully deployed in all the cavities of a typical building, pinhole insulation will double or triple the energy savings of traditional weatherization technologies.","Manufacturing, Other",1,Doug Lamm,1-10,2,,,,,150000,USD,150000,"Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, MIT Venture Mentoring Service (MIT VMS)",1,2,,Private,,,,,,

Even at that expense, much of it remains hidden, scattered throughout the enterprise, distributed among the business units, duplicated by mergers and acquisitions. Communications managers find themselves inundated with a mind-numbing array of service options, overwhelmed with literally boxes of bills, and continually asking for more headcount. Managing these multiple vendors diverts critical resources away from core business initiatives. Billing errors reduce funding for research, product development, marketing, and sales. Outages and downtime undermine relationships with customers and partners. With so much at stake, a comprehensive, single-source solution is needed for procuring and managing communications services.","Hardware, Information Technology, Professional Services",1,Ed Brinskele,51-100,3,M&A,104500000,USD,104500000,104500000,USD,104500000,"TPG, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Mayfield Fund, Thomas Weisel Partners, Bowman Capital",3,6,,Private,,,,,,

Based in Sherman Oaks, California, the company has a network of more than 190 locally operated branches across the nation and is licensed to offer purchase and refinance loans. History and Growth Formed in 2007, Prospect Mortgage quickly grew into a leading provider of mortgage services. In 2007, the firm acquired the assets of Metrocities Mortgage, LLC and F&T Mortgage and purchased Opteum Financial Services LLC, with the backing of Sterling Partners— a private equity firm focused on investing growth capital in small and mid-market companies. The following year, Prospect purchased substantially all of IndyMac Mortgage’s retail mortgage branches, doubling its size and creating one of the largest retail mortgage lenders in the United States. In 2009, the company united all of its divisions under the Prospect Mortgage name and brand.   To bolster its geographical reach, Prospect followed the IndyMac deal with the opening of a major operations center in Schaumburg, Illinois, near Chicago.   In the early 2010s, Prospect Mortgage continued to grow at a rapid clip, adding several high-profile hires along the way. In 2012, Prospect hired former Fannie Mae CEO Michael Williams as chairman of its board, and in 2014, appointed him to also serve as CEO of Prospect Mortgage.   In 2014 the company acquired the branch assets of Impac Mortgage and Diamond Mortgage Group adding more than a dozen locations and a host of in-house expertise to its increasingly formidable operations team. Later in 2014, Prospect sold certain assets of its appraisal management subsidiary, exiting the appraisal space and focusing its efforts to serve its retail mortgage customers.   Ranked number nine on Mortgage Executive Magazine's list of the “Top 100 Mortgage Companies in America” in 2014, Prospect Mortgage was also named a top 15 national home purchase lender that same year.   And as the calendar turned to 2015, Prospect announced that it would implement Secure Settlements, Inc.’s revolutionary Closing Guard tool to provide an unparalleled level of protection for its mortgage clients. Also in 2015, Prospect acquired certain assets of CapWest Mortgage, a Stilwell, Kansas-based call center operation focused on a consumer direct source of business. Products and Services Prospect Mortgage offers a wide range of loan products and services for current and prospective homeowners. Its signature offerings include:   Fixed-rate loans: Fixed rates for the entire term (15 or 30 years), based on the borrower’s credit profile and other factors. Adjustable-rate (ARM) loans: Rates periodically adjust to reflect current market conditions, meaning payment amounts may rise and fall over time. Offered in several configurations: 5/1, 7/1 and 10/1. Government loans: Prospect’s government loan program offerings include FHA loans, VA loans and more.  Refinance loans: Prospect’s refinance loans may result in lower interest rates or help homeowners better achieve their long-term financial goals. 203(k) renovation loans: Renovation loans can be completed as refinance or purchase loan transactions, enabling borrowers to invest in their homes’ future in a simple, convenient fashion. Fannie Mae foreclosure loans: Prospect Mortgage offers Fannie Mae foreclosure loans, which allow buyers to purchase foreclosed properties and can often be combined with renovation loans.","Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Real Estate",1,Anna Bye,1001-5000,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

After extensive research, the first Kinesis contoured keyboard, the Model 100, was launched commercially in 1992. This product is patented in the U.S. and other countries worldwide. The Model 100 was the first production-model ergonomic keyboard in the United States which was based on a traditional letter layout. Patented new manufacturing techniques had to be developed to facilitate the manufacturing process for a keyboard which lacked any significant flat surface! The success of the Kinesis contoured keyboard in solving intractable RSI problems has been remarkable and unprecedented. A pioneering spirit: Kinesis has pioneered other products, including the first general purpose foot switches supplementing keyboard input, the first adapter which allowed PC keyboards to connect to Macintosh computers, and also the first PS/2 keyboard adapter for Sun workstations. In 1996 Kinesis created a family of contoured keyboards to better meet the diverse needs of its customers. Always the pioneer, Kinesis created the first Mac/PC switchable and the first QWERTY/Dvorak switchable keyboards. 1997 brought the launch of the Maxim adjustable keyboard for computer users seeking a less expensive and less exotic step up from Microsoft’s “natural” style keyboard. In 1999 and 2000, subsequent continued expansion of the Kinesis product line has added selected pointing devices, and stand-alone programmable foot pedals and keypads, and keyboard/mouse trays optimized for Kinesis keyboards. The USB version of the contoured keyboard was introduced in 2002. Available in two models, the Advantage and the Advantage Pro. Features include: an integrated 2-port USB hub; instant configuration between Mac, Windows and non-Windows optimized layouts; and on-board, driverless programmability. In 2003 we added a line of Kinesis brand chairs which offer a remarkable feature set and moderate price. And in 2004, we created the flexible Savant Elite family of programmable foot switches for clicking the mouse and replacing other over-used key actions. Continued innovation: In the spring of 2007 Kinesis introduced its highly acclaimed Freestyle Solo convertible keyboard. The Freestyle design incorporated two years of intensive research including input from both ergonomists and health professionals. The result is the first mainstream ergonomic keyboard to offer interchangeable configurations accommodating the needs of each user. Kinesis has evolved over the years to become a company providing one-stop shopping for serious computer users looking for products offering the best in comfort and productivity. Through our family of resellers or through sales directly with Kinesis, you can count on value and service when dealing with Kinesis Corporation. Kinesis Corporation is a privately-held Washington State corporation.","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Manufacturing, Other, Software",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Trying the various online makeup bartering and trading communities, she experienced the major downsides of these communities, such as swap lifting, counterfeits, items arriving damaged in the mail, or worst of all - items in unusable condition. Instead of abandoning the makeup community, she decided to improve and unite it! In May 2013, Glambot quickly grew to become the online destination for the largest collection of rare, limited edition and discontinued items. New items added daily! Sellers use the website to estimate how much they'll receive on their items. They ship their items with a prepaid label and we make an offer on their items, which they can accept cash or Glambucks (credit) for future items. Buyers purchase makeup anywhere from 10-50% off retail prices, can enjoy a free 14 day return policy, and free domestic shipping when purchasing over $30, while international customers get free shipping over $60.","Commerce and Shopping, Consumer Goods",1,Karen Horiuchi,1-10,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,Base Ventures,,1,,Private,,,,,,
