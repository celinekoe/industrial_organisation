JiXler GO,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/jixler-go,"Advertising, E-Commerce, Information Technology, iOS, Location Based Services, Social Media, Social Media Marketing, Social Network, Software","San Angelo, Texas, United States",JiXler is a newly imagined AR Cloud platform and proximity social network,"1,067,222",Southern US,,Active,2014-07-24,day,,,,,For Profit,http://www.jixler.com/vc,"There are a lot of good ideas in the mobile industry, and some that are great, but let's face it, proximity-aware apps currently are not a reasonable fit to help small to medium-sized business gain the traction needed to effectively compete against big-box retailers.   The market problem: About a third (34%) of shoppers rank receiving promotional and sales information, sent directly to their phone when entering a store, as important.  	A study comprised a survey of 2,900 U.S. and Canadian consumers ages 10 to 73, and conducted by HRC Retail Advisory, highlights what consumers want, but the question remains:  	How do smaller brands get that information to consumers? It takes a proximity enabled app to detect and read proximity hardware.  Even if a small business had the time, talent and money to develop, publish and maintain a proximity aware app, consumers typically shrug downloading single-use / single-purpose apps.  It's the elephant in the room seldom talked about. 	For customers, obscure apps are perceived as a potentially cumbersome and unreliable, and for many it's an online personal-identity security issue. JiXler's angle: JiXler is a newly imagined AR Cloud platform and customer-centric proximity social network with a unique way to link end-users to online content. ""Customer-centric"" means developing a platform that makes sense of the web like humans make sense of the physical world.  In this way, JiXler effortlessly links people to services and information particular to the space they are currently in. This customer-driven design bridges the gap between 1) proximity technology and 2) the need for smaller organizations to deploy effective proximity strategies.    The JiXler strategy: Designed as a platform that makes sense to the consumer, JiXler is packaged as a social media app that can find proximity content anywhere, used with a multitude of applications.   	• JiXler essentially mass-equips consumers with proximity detection software. 	• The social media model is proven, as 96% of small business owners/marketers use social media marketing. (February 28, 2018 by Louise Myers) Social media networks give smaller brands real advantages. For brands: 	1) Entities can more easily reach proximity-enabled consumers by way of a single platform.  		a. This takes less development resources, including time, expertise and money. 	2) It also allows them to tap into an accumulating mass of users, instead of brands having to build their own user-base from scratch. 		a. Cumulative user-base: Once a customer adopts JiXler, they add themselves to an accumulating base of proximity-aware consumers. 			i. So, when a user signs up with JiXler to receive proximity content from Business A, the user is then equipped to also receive proximity content from Business B, even though Business-B never recruited them to download anything. 			ii. This makes JiXler an attractive solution for Business C, D and E, as well. For consumers: 	1) The JiXler app gives users a reliable proximity experiences on a single platform, branding expectations under the JiXler name.  		a. For consumers, JiXler provides a single point of control to access proximity content. 			i. Single login: A secure gateway that minimizes access to their personal data. 			ii. Single set of controls for personal info and notification preferences. 			iii. Single rewards retrieval: One place to search for & retrieve customer reward incentives. 			 	2) JiXler is open-source and so easy to use, that even the end-user can create proximity content, a social media characteristic unique to the JiXler platform. 		 Simplified semantics: JiXler simplifies nerdy technical proximity jargon into a usable language. Out with the nerdy ""geo-fence"" and in with a JiX, a symbolic acronym for anchor (J) - information (i) - here (X).  Thus, instead of saying  	""I placed a geo-fenced around this place with pertinent information inside it.  You'll need a certain app to see it.""  one would simply say,  	""I JiXed this place with pertinent information"" Similar to how people Tweet with Twitter, people plant a JiX with JiXler, describing a Geo-Fence containing online content, quicker and easier.  Entities and users control who see their proximity content: A JiX has a defined container with boundaries, providing selective access to the information it contains.   The JiX creator can set permissions as to who can see the information their JiX holds.  Plus, boundaries also define when a JiX's notifications are triggered as other users approach the target area.   For example, a JiX can be set such that a mechanic can get notifications about and see the JiX attached to an outdoor AC unit, but the general public cannot.   	 The same filtering process is applicable using demographics, as well.  For retailers, this allows for targeted proximity marketing.  For example,  	1) at an amusement park, teens can be presented with different information than made available to adults. 	2) For organizations, this allows for pre-qualified data access. 	3) For consumers, this allows for privacy and personal social interactions important to all social media networks.  There are literally hundreds of ways to use JiXes.   Monetizing JiXler:  AR CLOUD'S INEVITABLE EVOLUTION JiXler gives way to Chaos.  Chaos gives way to JiXler. 	1) The ability for anyone to place proximity content, creates a degree of proximity chaos in the world. Consumers can place posts about businesses on their property, or maybe even about the principal at a school.  In fact, a business can initiate proximity marketing on their competitor's location. 	2) As a way of monetizing, JiXler provides a solution to control proximity content on the premises of any property.  		a. Proximity Domains can be purchased from JiXler to allow a business to control proximity content placed in their location. 		b. Proximity Domains are similar to buying a URL Domains to control what's on a website, but applies to locations, instead. 		c. Perhaps generating $50 per business or entity location 			i. And large businesses are not excluded from this need, even if they never use JiXler. 		d. Controlling proximity content is a $10 to $20 billion potential market created by the JiXler platform. JiXler has easy-to-deploy, enhanced location-savvy features, that will level the retail technology playing field.  Now, small and medium sized retail businesses can compete as formidable competitors to big-box operations.

Working at a treadmill desk provides relief from sitting all day, helps unravel stress, and provides relief from lower back pain. Walking activates the calf muscles, improving circulation and reducing susceptibility to developing thrombosis and varicose veins from sitting and standing too much. It pumps more oxygen to the brain, sharpening the mind and improving one's mental outlook. And it gives travelers a badly needed respite from the spinal compression and lower back pain that result from too many hours squeezed into uncomfortable airline seats. It even burns off a few extra calories - without breaking a sweat, keeping your metabolism revving down too far. Treadio offers a wide variety of turnkey systems, shipped factory pre-assembled and requiring minimal periodic maintenance. All our systems are highly customizable to match the decor and space constraints of the facilities they are going into.
