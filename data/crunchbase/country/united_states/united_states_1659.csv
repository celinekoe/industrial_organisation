The 1980s brought an aggressive expansion program in the company’s history. To raise capital, Pep Boys split its stock 3-for-1 and moved to the New York Stock Exchange in 1982. This strategy enabled rapid growth and brought about the birth of the automotive supercenter. This concept boosted Pep Boys to more than 700 stores, almost 3,600 service bays and more than $2 billion in annual sales. Pep Boys The Road Ahead Pep Boys continued its expansion in the 1990s, including to Puerto Rico. As the automotive aftermarket need has shifted over time from a majority of auto parts customers who identify as “Do it Yourselfers” to an increasing number of customers who prefer service centers to take care of their automotive maintenance and repair, Pep Boys has expanded its service business. Today Pep Boys provides service for more than six million cars and car owners each year. More than 23 million rewards members have signed up for special offers in stores. Since 2009, Pep Boys has focused on the development of service and tire centers within its existing markets as its primary growth strategy. Today the company operates more than 7,400 service bays in nearly 800 stores nationwide. At the same time, in some of its traditional supercenters, the company has expanded to include speed shops within its retail stores, which cater to the growing number of car enthusiasts who have fun working on performance cars, like hot rods, muscle cars, and off-road trucks. In 2012, Pep Boys created a new service and retail customer experience, which it refers to as The Road Ahead. Similar to the experience found at some high-end car dealerships, new Pep Boys stores feature customer lounges with amenities such as complimentary Wi-Fi and flat screen TV's near its full-service maintenance and repair shops, as well as a diverse retail product assortment in the automotive aftermarket. With almost 20,000 friendly and knowledgeable associates living the legacy of Manny, Moe, and Jack, Pep Boys’ vision is to be the best place to shop and care for cars.","Commerce and Shopping, Other, Transportation",4,"Emanuel Rosenfeld, Jack n Jackso, Maurice Strauss, Moe Radavitz",10001+,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,4,Private,,,,,,

The App also allows patients to browse providers based on specialties and services offered, as well as by insurances accepted. This way, patients avoid surprises when arriving at the front desk. Additional patient benefits include: -- Filling out paperwork before arriving at urgent care facilities, hospitals, and other walk-in medical providers -- Seeing medical care facility information, including locations, hours of operation, estimated wait times, contact information, specialties and services offered, and insurances accepted -- Storage of their medical forms, medical history, pre-existing conditions, etc. -- Reduction of wait times in hospitals, clinics, emergency rooms, and other medical care providers -- Reduction of stress associated with unplanned, last-minute care and medical emergencies Urgently Health also notifies the hospital or clinic a patient chooses that they are on their way to them, providing healthcare facilities with an approximate travel time. This feature allows providers to expect patients and better prepare for their arrival before they get there. This is vitally important during emergencies where mere minutes can make a difference! Our accompanying Web Platform allows hospitals and clinics who accept walk-in patients to process them more effectively and with less confusion than in the past. When healthcare facilities use our Platform, they expand their visibility and streamline their day-to-day operations. This, in turn, increases their preparedness and allows them to discover and overcome bottlenecks, leading to more effective and efficient service, greater patient satisfaction and retention, and decreased costs. With patient information on-hand before they arrive, providers can assign severity, pre-triage, and verify information before their patients arrive. The Platform also provides healthcare administrators with statistics such as hot-times, most common ailments, and historical wait-times to mitigate over and under-staffing and ensure preparation.","Apps, Health Care, Mobile, Platforms, Software",,,1-10,1,Seed,250000,USD,250000,250000,USD,250000,Newchip Accelerator,,1,,Private,,,,,,
