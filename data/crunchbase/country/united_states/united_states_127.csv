Icii Technologies,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/icii-technologies,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cloud Security, Machine Learning, Network Security, Security","Las Vegas, Nevada, United States","Icii Technologies specializes in the fields of artificial intelligence, smarter medicine, autonomous drones, and enhanced security.","1,660,354",Western US,,Active,2020-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,https://icii.io/,"Icii Technologies specializes in the fields of artificial intelligence, smarter medicine, autonomous drones, and enhanced security. Icii breaks the mold by combining our patent-pending algorithms with existing overlooked computer chips to place AI in every device, every sensor, and Everywhere.  ""Icii Technologies LLC (Icii), which stands for Integrated Circuit Inference Innovations, was founded by Michael Bass in October 2019 with the goal of putting “AI Everywhere”. Due to Bass’s experience developing custom computer chips, training artificial intelligence (AI) models, and writing high-level software, he observed that engineers in these respective fields rarely possess the domain knowledge of the others. Furthermore, he observed that there were other limitations that must be overcome to put AI Everywhere. For edge and remote systems, it is untenable to continue sending data to a server for AI processing due to connectivity, bandwidth, and latency issues. Even worse, readily available edge and remote systems are too limited in both processing and power consumption for real-time AI calculations.   Enter, Icii’s flagship service, its AI to chip platform (AI-CP). Icii’s AI-CP is an innovative technology that circumvents the previous issues and limitations by performing AI calculations not through software, but through hardware. Most importantly, the AI-CP has been developed with an intense focus on usability and differentiates itself from the competition as the easiest method to implement AI at the edge.    AI-CP, AI algorithm to chip design IP  Icii’s AI-CP is a SaaS product that generates custom chip design IP that makes AI inferencing faster, smaller, and lower power with a single press of the button. The AI-CP's competitive advantage lies in its innovative approach of generating a full AI chip design algorithmically and instantly. The IP is generated for a client’s specific AI algorithms, differentiating Icii’s solution from competitors whose products target general applications. Furthermore, the generated designs can take advantage of low-power high-throughput computer chips that are often overlooked due to their complexity and development life cycle. This makes it possible to place AI-CP’s generated IP in any camera, sensor, or device.  Offered as a SaaS product, the AI-CP requires a fixed amount of labor and can reach an unlimited number of clients. With a focus on usability, the AI-CP platform reduces development time and cost significantly while improving performance. Icii’s AI-CP develops in less than two minutes what at least three to twelve computer engineers would develop in six to eighteen months. This reduces development time and development cost by 90% and simultaneously improves performance by at least 400%.      To drive additional business into the AI-CP, Icii also offers EIE (pronounced eye) and consulting services.     EIE  EIE is a miniature circuit board that provides clients access to Icii’s AI-CP through a ready-to-use and cost-effective channel. In line with Icii’s focus on providing the simplest solution possible, EIE’s modular interfaces can be easily integrated into various systems, sensors, cameras, detectors, etc., enabling real-time analysis while greatly reducing development time and cost. The processing unit of EIE is a low-power high-throughput field-programmable gate array (FPGA) that would be incapable of AI inferencing without Icii’s AI-CP optimizations. EIE, in conjunction with the AI-CP, provides a computational speed-up of 400% and increases memory efficiency by 350% over competing for AI accelerators.   Consulting  Icii’s customer discovery has identified many potential clients that need real-time, high-performance, low-power AI processing at the data source but lack AI and electrical engineering teams capable of producing the needed solutions. To provide AI solutions for these clients’ needs, Icii Consulting provides full-stack AI to EIE, FPGA, or application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) development. This is an ideal solution for original equipment manufacturers or partnering companies that excel at manufacturing, component integration, or product development and are seeking to incorporate AI to create a competitive advantage.""","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Privacy and Security, Science and Engineering, Software",1,Michael Bass,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
