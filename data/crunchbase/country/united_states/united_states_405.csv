We cast the best ideas with top talent and work hand in hand to make attractive, creative, and profitable companies that empower people to learn about and achieve the things they love. Advances in technologies are rapidly changing the context of business, and thus opening doors to new ways of doing things. TLM embraces and capitalizes on these changes by bringing new ideas and likeminded entrepreneurs together to extend their vision and create new value. These relationships help exponentially accelerate the success of new ventures and are reflected by less overhead, faster time to market, and a dramatic increase in early revenue. In return, TLM is able to create new technology and foster next generation business while gaining better, faster, and less expensive insights into what works â€“ and what doesnâ€™t. Our vision has never been about one idea, but rather the intersection of many. Itâ€™s this intersection that has come to guide the very special breed of professionals who compose our ventures â€“ and make them tick. Itâ€™s also this intersection that allows us to set the unique creative climate and prompts us to reach for the ideas and execution that bring fresh, memorable, and quality innovation. TLM is made up of a broadly diverse, cross-generational group of entrepreneurs, communicators, artists, and technologists. Each partner is wholly unique; yet it is precisely this eclectic mix of skills, experience, and perspectives that enrich the TLMâ€™s offerings and shape its culture. We value individuality. But, we also know how to be a team. We respect diverse opinions and lifestyles, both inside and outside of TLM. We intentionally seek diversity of background, talent, skills, and viewpoints as we recruit our creative, technical, executive, and advisory teams. Our differences unite and enrich us. We embrace risk thoughtfully. We walk along the creative edge of technology with confidence. We dance at the leading edge of design and innovation. The edge implies risk. We respond to risk with a sure balance and poise and a quick alert mind â€“ agility is grace in the presence of risk. We value integrity in what we say, what we do, and how we treat our many partners, employees, vendors, and investors. We set high standards of performance, and then seek to outperform them, always intending to deliver more than we promised. We treat people as we ourselves wish to be treated. We are can-do, always open to potentials, always confident in our future. We believe in the power of the mind, our ability when passionately and persistently focused to create a new reality, to convert our mission to that reality. It is a core principle at work among our partners. We dream big. We learn from the past, but look to the future. Our vision is not tomorrow or next year, but the next generation. And itâ€™s a vision that we walk toward expectantly and confidently. In so doing, we seek to be a preferred partner that attracts, develops and retains talented, high potential collaborators; to create a young and restless culture that embraces innovation, excellence, integrity, risk, and play; to develop, refine, and retain a creative technology and business edge that offers our partners and customers simplicity, options, and convenience; and to grow profitability to the benefit to all our shareholders.","Financial Services, Information Technology, Professional Services, Software",1,Jordan English,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Acris took over responsibility for marketing the DPC Biermann research products. From 1999 to 2003 Acris GmbH focused more and more on the research antibodies. In the beginning Acris GmbH served as a distributor for US and UK antibody manufacturers in the German market. In September 2003 Acris GmbH became a fully independent company and took over all research products and customers from DPC. Acris GmbH was renamed Acris Antibodies GmbH what should better reflect our business. From the very beginning it was Acris' mission to serve the research community with high quality research products. The idea was to resolve a problem that many researchers are confronted with: “How can I find a product/antibody which will work optimal in my research application”. To help these scientists Acris developed a platform for thousands of high quality antibodies in one easy to search online database. Since 2010, Acris has been able to offer more than 170,000 primary antibodies and more than 50,000 proteins, lysates and kits. Acris Antibodies developed from a German distributor to a global player in the research product / antibody market. Distributors in Europe and Asia were added and in the beginning of 2011 we opened a branch office in San Diego, USA. Since November 2012, Acris Antibodies GmbH is DIN EN ISO 9001 certified. We have implemented and certified our Quality Management to show our dedication towards our goal: We aim to satisfy our customers with outstanding service and high quality products. Learn more about our quality policy here. In the next couple of years Acris Antibodies will strengthen its international position and develop our database any further by adding new and innovative products like the Link-A-Light product line for quick and easy antibody or protein conjugation with dyes.","Biotechnology, Community and Lifestyle, Manufacturing, Science and Engineering",,,11-50,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
