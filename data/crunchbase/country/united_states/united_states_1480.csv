However, even when successful, current diagnostics take 2-5 days to identify the pathogen AND provide its antibiotic susceptibility profile. The lack of rapid, accurate, and comprehensive diagnostics, forces physicians to “carpet bomb” patients with severe infections with powerful, yet toxic, broad-spectrum antibiotics, which is not only ineffective in many cases but can also lead to significant morbidity and mortality.

The company's lead candidate, CMX001, is being developed as a potential broad spectrum antiviral agent for the treatment of life-threatening double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viral diseases. Over 350 people have received CMX001 to date, with a growing body of evidence supporting the drug's antiviral activity in humans. Clinical studies of CMX001 include an ongoing Phase 2 study of the prevention/control of cytomegalovirus (CMV) in hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients (CMX001-201), a Phase 2 study being initiated for the treatment of adenovirus (AdV) infection in pediatric and adult hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients (CMX001-202), and an Open-Label Study (CMX001-350) for the treatment of any of 12 different dsDNA viral infections, including AdV, herpes viruses such as CMV, herpes simplex virus and Epstein Barr virus, polyoma viruses such as BK virus and JC virus, and pox viruses. The Open-Label Study builds on Chimerixâ€™s extensive experience working with clinicians at over 55 leading institutions in the United States, Canada, Europe and Israel who have sought CMX001 for the treatment of more than 150 immunocompromised patients under Emergency INDs. CMX001 has been well tolerated in all studies. CMX001 is also being developed as a medical countermeasure in the event of a smallpox release. Chimerix has received significant federal funding for the development of CMX001 as a medical countermeasure against smallpox from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Chimerix's second clinical-stage antiviral compound, CMX157, a potent nucleoside analogue with in vitro activity against HIV and hepatitis B, has the potential to directly address several limitations of current HIV therapies. Chimerix is developing CMX157 for the treatment of HIV infection including those caused by multi-drug resistant viruses. A Phase 1 clinical study has been completed demonstrating that the compound is well tolerated and that the active antiviral, TFV-PP, was measurable in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after a single dose and remained detectable for six days, indicating that it may be suitable for once-weekly dosing. Led by a world-class antiviral drug development team, Chimerix is also leveraging the company's extensive chemical library to pursue new treatments for hepatitis C virus, flu, malaria and other global public health needs.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",2,"George Painter, Kevin Anderson",51-100,14,IPO,430149178,USD,430149178,518249178,USD,518249178,"National Institutes of Health, Morningside Group, Alta Partners, Frazier Healthcare Partners, Canaan Partners",6,12,1,Public,2013-04-12,,,CMRX,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/chimerix-ipo--a32d18b0,NASDAQ
