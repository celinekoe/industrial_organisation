Petrol cars were unreliable and dirty, but Detroit Electrics could be charged at home and used in an instant – making them extremely popular. Even Henry Ford’s wife drove one. As the years passed and petrol engines became cheaper and stronger, sales of electric vehicles dropped. Finally, after producing a total of 13,000 cars – a world record for electric vehicles in the 20th century – the last Detroit Electric was shipped in 1939. We’re back, over 70 years on.

Now if you are on vacation who wants to take a taxi to go get drinks and pay while they wait for you to shop, who wants to spend all their money they brought on a few drinks? Not too many, but .. Everyone likes to have a few drinks before they go out to loosen up and relax or the restaurant industry workers, bartenders, servers etc want a drink to take home but by the time they get off work and drive somewhere all the liquor stores are closed. Plus not only is it in high demand the merchandise for Beaver Liquors would be the hottest new thing around, all the tourists would want to take home a shirt, cozie or hat. We all do that when on a vacation, got to have some type of souvenir to take home. I hope you can see the potential in this company and help me bring it to life.

Almost two decades ago, Jeff Mann, president and executive editor of Mann Publications, had already built and maintained successful apparel and real estate businesses when he saw a void in the market for coverage of the real people behind the scenes in the Garment District. He created Fashion Mann- uscript, which started as a four-page newsletter and has since evolved into a monthly magazine distributed throughout the country, with extensive photo coverage of important industry events, informative columns by experts in the community, and profiles of the people and companies at the top of all industry-related fields. With the success of Fashion Mannuscript came the idea of an expansion. Mr. Mann decided he would tackle the real estate market when he launched Mann Report in the spring of 1998. Over the years, the success of these magazines has created room for the inclusion of both residential and retail real estate titles, Mann Report Residential and Mann Report Retail, respectively; Mann About Town, a New York lifestyle magazine; Mann On The Street, a Wall Street/financial industry focused title; Mann Report Building, concentrating on the world of architects, interior designers, and construction; and the newest addition, Mann Report Management, serving as a resource for property managers throughout the tri-state area.","Clothing and Apparel, Community and Lifestyle, Content and Publishing, Design, Media and Entertainment, Real Estate",1,Jeff Mann,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
