With offices in Washington, DC; New York; Tampa; and Baltimore, their firm is involved in many of the most significant and topical litigation matters across the country. Their clients often turn to us to resolve their most challenging legal problems. They do so in part because they count among their ranks many of the nation’s most distinguished lawyers, including former federal prosecutors and public defenders as well as attorneys who have served in key roles on Capitol Hill, in federal agencies, and in state government. The remarkable experience of their attorneys is second only to the depth of their expertise. Lawyers at Zuckerman Spaeder offer substantive knowledge that encompasses such diverse areas as FDA law, legal and professional ethics, health care fraud, bankruptcy litigation, tax controversy, intellectual property, American Indian law, executive-level employment law, and nonprofit law, among others. Their firm thrives in those particular cases in which civil litigation and business counseling intersect with white collar investigations and issues of regulatory compliance. They frequently represent clients who are simultaneously involved in these challenging forums, sometimes in cases of national significance. Zuckerman Spaeder was founded in Washington, DC in 1975 by a highly cohesive group of lawyers with backgrounds as Assistant U.S. Attorneys and public defenders, all devoted to exceptional client commitment. Since then, they have grown because of the recognition that their work has received and because of the addition of exceptional attorneys who share their founding values: a commitment to excellence in the service of their clients; a commitment to decency and fairness in their relationships with their adversaries; and an unqualified and overarching commitment to the full and fair administration of justice. Zuckerman Spaeder’s track record and philosophy have garnered significant recognition from the national legal community. Their firm has been named to The National Law Journal’s “Midsize Hot List” every year since 2010, and was recognized as a finalist for “Litigation Boutique of the Year” by The American Lawyer in 2005 and 2009, both times the competition was held. In 2010, U.S. News and World Report recognized Zuckerman Spaeder as one of 27 law firms ranked in the top tier nationally for commercial litigation.  Zuckerman Spaeder is also the top-listed firm for white collar criminal defense in Best Lawyers, with more attorneys recognized in that category than any other firm in the country.",Professional Services,,,251-500,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Program details:  Fuel is a 12-week startup training program hosted on-site in  Northwest Arkansas  Participants will engage with a diverse group of senior supply chain & logistics experts, including: Fortune 500 leaders, tech founders, venture capital firms, higher ed institutions, and public policy officials. Activities include weekly CEO roundtables, enterprise-ready working sessions, mentor office hours, supply chain lunches, site visits, and a demo day showcasing event.   Unique differentiators:   - Collaboration Not Competition We are building out this program to be one that focuses on collaboration: between both startup entrepreneurs and enterprise partners. We want to build a community, so we will not take on more than one startup in a competing space and are not running the program as a competition. - Tangible Business Growth We expect you to come out of this program having made clear, tangible strides. Some smaller outcomes include feedback sessions, training, pilots and demos with enterprise mentors. But our bigger goal is for you to leave with access to funding, sales opportunities, or a potential acquisition. - No Equity Exchanged We do not take any equity for this program because the expectation is that this will be a mutually valuable exchange between startups and their enterprise mentors through deep learning and connections. We simply ask for your time and commitment to make this program worthwhile for all involved.  About the region:  Northwest Arkansas is among the fastest-growing areas in the United States and is home to both a vibrant startup ecosystem and three Fortune 500 companies: Walmart, Tyson, and J.B. Hunt. Retail capital of the world, NWA provides a competitive advantage with a density around both mentors and partners interested in supply chain innovation. Northwest Arkansas has also been ranked in the Top 5 Places to Live for the last three years by U.S. News and World Report for its bike trails, museums, restaurants, low cost of living, and proximity to nature. So don’t worry, there’s plenty to keep you busy. The team behind Fuel:  RevUnit and Startup Junkie have teamed up to bring this program to seed-stage startup ventures.  In 2013, RevUnit, then a small team of just 12 full-time employees, became one of Walmart’s key, strategic technology partners before its first official birthday. Six years later, RevUnit is a key strategic technology partner to each of the Fortune 500 companies in the immediate Northwest Arkansas area, including Walmart, J.B. Hunt, and Tyson. Headquartered at the Exchange in the heart of the Bentonville Arts District, RevUnit has grown at a triple-digit rate for the past three years and now employs a close-knit family of nearly 100 talented designers, developers, and strategists who are scattered all across the country building technology to help enterprises work better. RevUnit is proud to have been named to the Inc. 5000 list of America’s Fastest Growing Companies for each of the past two years and was recently named on Entrepreneur’s list of Top Company Cultures. RevUnit has also been named as a Best Place to Work in Arkansas for three consecutive years, and its founders, Joe Saumweber and Michael Paladino, were recognized by the Small Business Administration as the 2018 Arkansas Small Business Persons of the Year. Having helped scale hundreds of ventures in Northwest Arkansas, Startup Junkie is an Entrepreneurial Support Organization and the drumbeat for activity in the local startup ecosystem.  Specifically, Startup Junkie helps entrepreneurs start and grow ventures through 1:1 consultation, events, workshops, and programs like this accelerator. The Startup Junkie team has facilitated 10 previous accelerator programs with nearly 150 alumni companies. They engage thousands of entrepreneurs in the region through a vibrant startup culture.
