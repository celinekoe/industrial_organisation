PROBLEM •	Online shopping does not provide customers a way to experience the product like they can at the store. •	Written content is not well suited for a mobile-first, social-sharing world. •	Retailers and brands want video because they know their shoppers want it (over 80% of all Internet traffic will be video by 2019 and because it sells more product). •	Retailers and brands don’t have enough video because producing, gathering or managing enough video to meet customer demand is logistically and financially impossible. SOLUTION •	Criteek enhances the shopping experience and engages shoppers with personalized customer-generated video directly on the product page, leading to increased sales. •	Criteek patent-pending technology streamlines the process of activating customers, then gathering, screening, hosting, managing and streaming their video to the product page and social networks, and sharing it among marketing partners, through an easily-managed online dashboard.  •	Clients get a sustainable, scaled pipeline of credible video from their customers and their partners for the cost of moderation. •	Criteek collects proprietary data with insights into the shopping experience, how shoppers consume video and how video can be used to increase sales. WHY NOW? Brands and retailers can no longer compete on price and product differentiation alone. Now, they are competing squarely on customer experience.  Video is the immediately scalable medium that transforms the customer experience.  Recognizing this, Amazon has begun to gather and stream video reviews from their customers.  However, their tech is proprietary. Criteek now provides brands and retailers with a way to remain competitive. TECHNOLOGY 	Tech is patent-pending. 	Tech is difficult to build. 	The platform creates value by:  -- helping clients increase shopper engagement and sales; -- providing an interdependent video content network among those clients; -- producing a proprietary data set around video & eCommerce. TEAM Scott Randall, CEO 	Founded BrandGames, the first company to leverage videogames as media 	Marketed to Fortune 500 companies, including Pizza Hut, GAP, TacoBell, & Pepsi 	Sold BrandGames in 2001 	Built the digital & ecommerce infrastructure for a $220mm children’s brand 	Marketing thought leader – presented at global conferences (Milken Global Conference) 	Award winning marketer - Marketing Technology Award, WebAwards, Art Direction’s Creativity Award, Davey Award, Communicator Award Rahul Khosla, CTO 	Founder - eDynamic: marketing tech agency 	ex-Accenture consultant and digital marketing executive 	Advised and consulted Fortune 500 firms on marketing technology 	Marketing automation expert Kyle Wilkinson, COO 	BI & marketing analytics at GILT & BTR 	Customer data modeling expert 	Derivatives modeler & trader 	Built & managed financial risk models COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE 	Criteek’s patent-pending technology has the ability to capture, moderate, stream & syndicate video across multiple domains. 	Criteek creates an eco-system of video content sharing: --video is easily acquired from customers, partners & social networks and creates a content-sharing network. 	Criteek creates platform dependency for users   --clients depend on video-sharing content pipeline. 	Criteek produces data & insight: --the Criteek platform gives us a proprietary view of the use, sharing & performance of video for use in increasing client sales.","Advertising, Commerce and Shopping, Content and Publishing, Hardware, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Sales and Marketing, Software, Video",3,"Kyle Wilkinson, Rahul Khosla, Scott Randall",1-10,1,,,,,115000,USD,115000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Younique is based near Salt Lake City, but the brand is open to Presenters and customers in more than a dozen countries worldwide: the United States, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Belgium, Austria, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, and most recently Columbia. Resources and Support for Younique Presenters Younique pioneered a “social first” approach to direct beauty product sales, and Younique Presenters continue to leverage social media channels like Instagram and Pinterest to build and scale their businesses. From day one, every Younique Presenter gets access to a robust collection of sales resources and tools to build a successful business: - A personalized e-commerce store where potential customers can find and purchase beauty products - The Younique Rewards Links are a publicly visible way to easily earn Y-CASH credit (product credit) from purchases from customers - The Younique Back Office system, which includes everything Presenters need to manage and grow their businesses - An array of text and video resources to help Presenters get started, troubleshoot e-commerce issues, and more Younique Presenter Earnings Younique Presenters earn commission on every product sale — starting at 20% and increasing as Presenters progress. Younique’s Instant Royalties process pays out within three hours of each sale, and Younique also offers monthly Royalties to high-performing Presenters who reach predetermined monthly sales milestones.  Younique in the Community Younique is proud to donate 10% of the profits from its product sales to Saprea, a nonprofit organization that works closely with survivors of sexual abuse and helps parents and caregivers address and prevent abuse in vulnerable young people.  Younique is also on a mission to support women entrepreneurs everywhere. For their part, Younique Presenters get access to the Younique Family, an international community of entrepreneurs built around the simple idea that everyone deserves to look and feel beautiful — inside and out.  Younique’s Co-Founders Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Derek Maxfield spent more than a decade as a software developer in the direct-sales industry before developing the vision for Younique with Huscroft. He saw the potential for transformative improvements to the direct-sales model and doubled down on the mobile revolution when many were still skeptical. This set the stage for Younique’s anytime-anywhere digital sales model. Younique co-founder and Chief Visionary Officer Melanie Huscroft balanced a career as a marketing and sales professional with her role as a full-time mom for more than a decade before launching the brand with Maxfield. Today, she is responsible for Younique’s visual identity — from digital design to packaging — and for interfacing with Younique Presenters. Both Maxfield and Huscroft live by Younique’s corporate motto — “Keep it simple, keep it special” — and this influences every interaction with Younique Presenters and customers.

EqualMetrics fills this gap with the ability of users to track and share data on trade names, related parties and hard-to-find information about small businesses. The mass collaboration model that EqualMetrics leverages provides accurate and timely information on small and medium-sized businesses. For credit monitoring, a proprietary eight question credit survey compiles important payment metrics for businesses as reported by their vendors and suppliers. Businesses use the website to build their credit track record, provide info to vendors and customers, and better understand their own B2B customers' payment patterns.","Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Other, Payments",1,Greg Robertson,11-50,2,Seed,,USD,,585000,USD,585000,Springfield Angels,,1,,Private,,,,,,

Rivada Networks provides advanced communications solutions to the public safety community at local, state and federal levels.  Rivada Networks' technologies enable public safety agencies to retain absolute control over their own dedicated broadband networks, while enabling the generation of valuable revenues from unused capacity, when available. Following the events of 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina, Congress allocated dedicated radio spectrum in the 700 Mhz band, to US public safety. The legislation allows for non-priority access to the spectrum for competitive commercial users.  Rivada’s core technology, Dynamic Spectrum Arbitrage Tiered Priority Access (DSATPA) works out to the very edge of the network, allowing public safety absolute priority access with instant (millisecond) pre-emption in the event of an emergency situation – thus guaranteeing first responders access to the highest quality bandwidth capacity at the moment they need it most. Meanwhile, in the extended periods of time when the public safety broadband network has significant extra bandwidth to spare, DSATPA allows that capacity to be dynamically auctioned in a fully competitive 'on demand' process to competing commercial entities – providing more choice and availability to industry and consumers while generating essential revenue for the public safety mission. DSATPA is a game changer for the way in which spectrum is consumed, maximising the efficiency of the radio spectrum bandwidth resource and unlocking the potential for more extensive high capacity broadband networks.  Rivada has served public safety for a decade, helping to meet their unique and critical communications challenges. Rivada Networks' work has been recognised for helping to save lives during times of severe crisis, such as Hurricane Katrina and multiple other emergencies and disasters. Rivada Networks' commitment to helping the men and women who stand on the front lines of emergency situations is absolute and their dedicated team of innovators work tirelessly to bring their unparalleled expertise to the task.","Government and Military, Hardware",1,Declan Ganley,101-250,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Have you felt like you paid too much for an overrated club or spent too much money on a dinner date that went nowhere? This has happened to almost all of us at one time or another.

RecruitiFi,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/recruitifi,"Crowdsourcing, Human Resources, Recruiting, Software","New York, New York, United States","RecruitiFi allows employers to fill jobs through an Expert Referral System (ERS), which matches their roles to curated expert recruiters.","192,827","Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",$1M to $10M,Active,2013-12-01,day,,,,,For Profit,https://www.recruitifi.com,"RecruitiFi has created a unique new category of recruiting known as the Expert Referral System (ERS), which allows companies to leverage a crowd of expert recruiters in a targeted and confidential manner. A growing number of Fortune 500 companies are utilizing RecruitiFi's ERS platform to quickly fill their open positions with vetted, qualified talent. As an added benefit, the Expert Referral System streamlines agency interaction, allowing employers to manage their existing suppliers, vet new agencies, and utilize RecruitiFi's crowd of proven, expert recruiters at a low, flat placement fee.  How does it work for Employers?  Employers invite their current recruiting agencies to work at their existing fees, while leveraging RecruitiFi’s community at one low, flat fee. Recruiters are then scored in real time as employers view, sort, disposition, and hire their candidates. This allows the platform’s algorithms to match future jobs to a subset of qualified recruiters based on their performance on similar searches. The ERS eliminates the need to review recruiters based on anecdotal observations, automatically vetting new agencies and managing existing recruiters based on real data. It’s quick, confidential, easy, and taps into new pools of talent, resulting in higher quality candidates and a reduced time-to-hire.  How does it work for Recruiters?  Using a recruiter’s preferred industries, roles, and locations, the algorithm provides closely matching job requisitions (JobCasts). RecruitiFi actively vets all JobCasts, ensuring they have an active hiring need and do not have candidates in process. Additionally, the ERS platform requires detailed employer feedback, while RecruitiFi’s account managers provide a direct line of contact, eliminating the notorious ""Resume Black Hole."" The result: more transparency and more placement fees. Recruiters also enjoy a unique payment model that awards cash bonuses for quality candidates—even if they don't ultimately get hired!","Administrative Services, Other, Professional Services, Software",5,"Brin McCagg, Jesse Glass, Justin Luciani, Norman Clausen, Sammy Smith",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Much later, in conjunction with Ray Ozzie's Iris Associates, Lotus also released a groupware and email system, Lotus Notes.
