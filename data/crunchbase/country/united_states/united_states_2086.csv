GOOZZY speeds up the sharing process by allowing users to place a â€œpost-it noteâ€ anywhere on the webpage in a single click, write a short comment and share it with others through the GOOZZY platform, as well as through Twitter, Facebook and email without leaving their browser. Once the recipient of the â€œpost-it noteâ€ is notified, they can immediately be directed to the page they were sent, see the note, reply and continue to share and socialize.  GOOZZY creates an online environment that encourages a shared, social browsing experience where users share their thoughts while browsing and without having to actually leave the browser. The integration with other social networks, such as Twitter and Facebook, makes Goozzy a natural extension and necessary component for those who enjoy networking, sharing and socializing.

In order to comply with GMP manufacturing and globalize, we have established a new company in the US; all IP (patents, data, know-how) and licensing rights belong to the new company, where operations & manufacturing are now under the direction of an experienced US team. There has always been a critical shortage of blood worldwide; as the population grows & ages, that shortage will grow. Many people outside of the US are told at the hospital to get friends & family to donate blood but it often arrives too late, and there is no inventory on hand.  Perftoran (to be rebranded as Vidaphor, meaning life-bearing) is completely artificial; it is not hemoglobin based. It does not need to be matched to blood type, saving time & resources; its use virtually eliminates the risk of viral transmission (not all countries screen donors to the extent that we do in the US) and unlike blood, which expires in 4-6 weeks, the shelf life of Perftoran is 3-5 years when stored frozen; adverse reactions, some of which are very serious and can result in lengthy hospital stays and even death can occur following a blood transfusion, while there have been very few serious reactions reported after more than 30,000 exposures.  The majority of recipients of Perftoran (88%) have had very good results; mild to moderate adverse reactions have occurred in 4% of recipients, the majority of which have been transfusion reactions (flu-like symptoms, flushing).  Our first market is Mexico, where we will relaunch the rebranded product; thereafter, we will expand throughout Latin America under mutual recognition agreements with Mexico.  In 2005, the market for whole blood was valued at >$7B.  We also have 3 other products whose potential market sizes are equal to or surpass that of artificial blood.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
