Technology evolves and moves forward, and we understood that libraries would need an innovative partner who could not only develop and deploy that technology, but also remain committed to the support, maintenance, and service behind the products. Every library has its own story, and partnering with TLC moves the story along. Everything we do, we do with librarians and patrons in mind. Our Library•Solution and CARL•Solution software platforms are built on mobility, flexibility, and operational efficiency. Each library management system is uniquely positioned to serve the needs of the individual library. As each story is different, each product provides the value, flexibility, and functionality to empower libraries to best serve their unique communities. We designed them to ensure that librarians and staff could spend more time on the things important to their library story without any extra hassle. Our story includes collaboration with thought leaders. In the late 1990s, TLC partnered with Oracle to bring libraries the very best database structure. This twenty-year-long partnership with Oracle has now evolved into TLC•Cloud Services. Developed using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), TLC•Cloud Services are a result of both organizations’ commitment to deliver high-performance enterprise technologies to the non-profit public sector. TLC knows that your library story is going to expand and change. Our pledge to serve and work with librarians encouraged us to acquire Tech Logic, creators of the first automated materials handling system specifically designed for the library industry, to expand library capabilities. When makerspace and hardware products began to change the shape of libraries everywhere, we launched TLC•SmartTECH to partner with manufacturers who share our vision of increased library engagement and ever-advancing library services. We believe in providing the latest technology for your libraries and embrace a service mission that breaks through the software and hardware. We set ourselves apart by hiring librarians, learning from our customers, understanding and developing for library-specific workflows, and offering industry-leading support services. We will be there whenever you need us. TLC delivers a superior line of products and services that are refined by collaborating with the people who really use them. Libraries and school districts who choose TLC are more than our customers; they’re our partners, and we write our story together. Stability. Excellence. Unparalleled Service. We are TLC.

Led by CEO Sally Osberg since 2001, their mission is to drive large scale change by investing in, connecting and celebrating social entrepreneurs and the innovators who help them solve the world’s most pressing problems. Social entrepreneurs are society’s change agents, creators of innovations that disrupt the status quo and transform our world for the better. By identifying the people and programs already bringing positive change around the world, we empower them to extend their reach, deepen their impact and fundamentally improve society.  The Skoll Foundation is now one of the leading foundations in the field of social entrepreneurship. Over the past 14 years, they have awarded approximately $413 million, including investments in 108 remarkable social entrepreneurs and 87 organizations on five continents who are creating a brighter future for underserved communities. In addition to these investments, we fund a $25 million portfolio of program-related investments (PRIs).  In 2003, they partnered with the Saïd Business School at the University of Oxford to launch the first academic center dedicated to social entrepreneurship, the Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship.  They also support and partner with many pioneers and innovators in the field, organizations such as Ashoka, Acumen Fund and Duke University’s Center for the Advancement of Social Entrepreneurship. As the field has matured and they entered their second decade, they are focusing our strategy. They are developing a deeper understanding of the issue areas where our social entrepreneurs operate so we can apply more resources at critical moments to maximize our collective impact. Learn more about their approach. Beyond investments and partnerships, we also operate programs that foster collaboration such as the Skoll World Forum which is the premier conference on social entrepreneurship and now a year-round online platform where executive audiences can learn about the latest news and innovative approaches in a variety of focus areas (e.g. deforestation, education and economic opportunity, or healthcare access and treatment), and engage with the world’s leading thinkers and doers of social change on key questions, challenges and opportunities.  They also share the stories of social entrepreneurs through partnerships with leading film and broadcast organizations such as the PBS NewsHour and the Sundance Institute, which help drive public awareness of social entrepreneurship and its potential to address the critical issues of our time.","Financial Services, Lending and Investments, Other, Social Impact",1,Jeffrey S.

In it, I wanted to know the following: What did he believe to be most important in life? If he could’ve gone back in time and spoken with his 20-year-old self, what would he say? Did he have any regrets? It was important for me to understand the world as he saw it; to learn from his successes, his mistakes, and potentially save myself from making some of my own. I wanted to see life through his eyes, if only for a moment. I wanted to capture his words — his memories. I wanted to remember his stories as if they were my own to share, and help them live on from generation to generation. Unfortunately, I never received that letter. The wisdom I had so longed to capture from my grandfather passed away alongside him. Years later, leading up to my wedding day, I requested the same of other elders in my family, hoping to make up for prior opportunities lost. But again, I was left letter-less. It was around this time that the idea for Heirloom first came to mind. With all of the technology and connectivity available to us in the world, there had to be an easier, more formalized way of documenting the experiences of our loved ones. There had to be an easier way of preserving and sharing their words long after their physical time in this world had come and gone. And now, there is. It’s easy to attach value to things; to want for nothing, buy just about any product you can imagine from the comfort of your couch, and feel instantly gratified.

We took a difficult, heavily regulated line of insurance, made it our singular focus, and made it better. We did this by first learning its intricacies and the very real human risk it addresses. We then used that insight to help our customers better manage their risk. This pattern of deep study, considering the human side of risk, seeing opportunities where others see obstacles, and educating customers carried us to new product lines, new challenges, and a global collective of loyal customers and partners. Our Mission We guide governments, businesses, and people through financial risk by applying unconventional thinking to the conventional tools of insurance, reinsurance, investing, and business services. Digging deeper, applying technology and analytics, finding profitable avenues through even the toughest risks—we help our customers and partners manage uncertainty so they can push confidently toward their highest aspirations. Our Values From building an entire nature conservatory and sustainability-minded community around our new headquarters, to bringing a struggling U.S. industry back to life, to finding new ways to effectively insure earthquakes and wildfires, Applied always thinks big. That’s how we attract top talent and give them the space to do their best work for our customers and partners. They live our core values every day: Sustainability and Human Connection Insurance teaches respect for the natural world—its power and fragility—and it is inextricably linked to the human story behind every risk. Applied takes those lessons to heart and applies them to every new venture we take on. Knowledge Sharing From the first year we published our Workers’ Compensation Almanac—now in its 8th edition—we’ve embraced the idea of helping our partners and customers understand risk so they’re in a better position to manage it. Building Trust Through Strong Financials We see disciplined financial strength as a core value since, without it, we can’t build customer confidence. Applied’s insurance companies became the first monoline workers’ compensation writer to receive an A+ (Superior) rating from AM Best in 2011. Our Global Expansion A natural progression of Applied’s greatest strength—applying risk financing and management techniques that improve the socioeconomic development of communities—is to expand our capabilities around the globe. Venturing into sovereign finance and risk transfer brings to governments everywhere our creativity and ability to connect people and capital. With our guidance and vast global resources, governments find unimagined ways to create growth, opportunity, and better lives for their citizens.",Financial Services,1,Steve Menzies,501-1000,,,,,,,,,,,,4,Private,,,,,,

Mission: Memories make us who we are. As we age, we collect billions of bits of memories. Sometimes, our physical and mental health causes us to lose sight of our memories which causes us to forget who we are. Thanks to easy to use technology like voice computing, we can now access our memories easily, reminding us of the great lives we led and sharing them with the younger generations to come.  Objectives: We empower active aging and longevity using software on voice computing platforms like Amazon’s Alexa to deliver reminiscence therapy. Our application Memory Lane is available for free on the Alexa skill store and uses historic audio clips to take visitors to any year from 1906 to present day. These recordings spark memories about what happened in the user’s life within a given year. Version 2 of Memory Lane will sync to a web interface to enable creation of unique personal memories uploaded by the individual (as a digital diary) or by loved ones who share reminiscences. Strategy: We are enabling voice computing in every room in every senior care facility in America. We can do this by creating a management system for voice computing devices and A.I. applications that provide customize experiences for aging individuals. Caregivers will have the ability to conduct daily tasks with greater ease, set up scheduling tasks and engage in activities. Our flagship product, Memory Lane, is ideal to help bring families closer together around the memories of the aging individual and be used in existing memory care programs throughout the country. Action Plans: We are working with four large organizations in New York and Vermont to pilot the use of Alexa in daily operations and host Memory Lane workshops to keep care-recipients engaged with each other, their caregivers, friends, and families. Our pilot will focus on feedback from caregivers, cognitively healthy seniors, those with early dementia, and then those with dementia.  In 2017, we will develop Memory Lane V2 with subscription and also develop for Google Assistant. We will continue to curate and expand the public Memory Lane library. We are establishing partnerships to run pilot studies in senior assisted living and memory care facilities. We are raising funds to pay our coders and complete our research study on Alexa & aging.","Apps, Internet Services, Software",1,Andy Kropa,1-10,1,,,,,50000,USD,50000,,,,,Private,,,,,,
