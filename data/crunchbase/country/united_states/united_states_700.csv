Its industry-leading software platform connects those who need to ship cars with the brokers who arrange shipment and the truckers who provide the transport service.  It allows each party to the process to search for solutions, to evaluate alternatives, to contract for service, to  document vehicle condition, to track transport en-route and to pay or be paid upon completion. All in a single, seamless, end-to-end, paperless process.  The full-featured version of the platform was built for professional users: car dealers, auction houses, fleet owners, transport companies and transport brokerage companies. As more vehicle transactions are taking place on-line, more individuals need to arrange vehicle shipment. Most have no experience and many make poor, and often expensive, choices. So they have also  created a version of the platform to serve the individual market. The dominant product in their market  was introduced in 1999. It has not kept pace with changes either in technology or in the industry. Its strength is in its professional customer base, which has been offered little alternative over the years. However, that customer base is broadly dissatisfied with the product's lack of functionality and its focus on one participant in the transport chain -- the car dealer -- to the detriment of the broker and carrier communities. That product does not offer an option for the individual user. Auto Load Logic was conceived and created by transport industry professionals. Their founders know the business from the ground up and that hands-on, in-depth knowledge informs both their product and their management.  The vehicle transport business is changing dramatically as the way both professionals and individuals buy cars. That is driving dramatic change in the vehicle transport market, which now needs a new and more effective solution. Auto Load Logic is that solution.","Internet Services, Software, Transportation",2,"Deron Balch, Laurie Balch",1-10,1,,,,,250000,USD,250000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Caregivers face depleted income due to reduced productivity, higher use of health care services, decreased quality of life, higher burnout and risk of earlier mortality. The economic value of the caregivers' time spent providing more than 8.5 billion hours of care is estimated to be nearly $234 billion.

Manufacturers, service providers, and retailers need to improve the connected device purchase process by driving consumer awareness and improving consumer access to comprehensive product information. They also need to educate their sales teams on selling these smart products which involves significant time and capital investments. GearBrain has developed a patent pending IoT configurator called The GearBrain. It’s the first compatibility checker which uses their IoT expertise, proprietary database of connected devices and pioneering recommendation engine to educate buyers and sellers. It can also help buyers easily “find” devices which is hard to do today using search engines. We track over 260 product attributes which can help users easily find the right compatible device. In addition, the company plans to license The GearBrain to brands and companies in these seven critical categories to help them generate product research and automate the customer service process (i.e. troubleshooting): retail, cable, telecommunication, home security, public utilities, professional installers and consumers tech sites.

In 1979, Jeff Heimbigner recognized that children of varying athletic levels did not have the same opportunity to learn sport-specific skills as serious players or elite young athletes. Many of these children aspired to be better players, but unfortunately did not have the best setting in which to learn sport-specific skills, have fun, be safe, and take those lessons home and apply them to their everyday lives. Jeff had a vision that every child should experience the joy and benefits of sports. Jeff created a purpose for the company: “Teaching life skills through sports.” With his vision and purpose stated, Skyhawks Sports was born. Skyhawks Sports started as a regional soccer program focused in the Pacific Northwest. The popularity of the camps grew as the years went by, and some amazing athletes and wonderful individuals emerged. The Skyhawks Sports soccer-focused camps emphasized critical lessons in life, such as sportsmanship, teamwork, and winning and losing with grace. Remaining true to its purpose and vision, Skyhawks added more sports to the offering and safe, fun, and skill-focused sports camps were realized. Over the last 30 years, vibrant memories have been created in the lives of students, coaches, and long-term associates of Skyhawks. Hundreds of excited children arrive when Skyhawks Sports comes to town to hold a sports camp. Full of interaction and excitement, the camps provide great fun for everyone, and our best camps are known to have a festival-like atmosphere. The most incredible part of a Skyhawks Sports camp is that the children forget that they are learning very valuable sport and life skills, because those lessons are so well integrated with friendly and fascinating play. Most important to us, and the purpose of Skyhawks Sports, is to teach life skills through sports. The development of Skyhawks Sports has been a wonderful ride for everyone involved, and we expect to continue to make a difference--one child at a time. Today we offer 15 different sports (Soccer, Basketball, Flag Football, Baseball, Multi-Sport, Tennis, Mini-Hawk, Lacrosse, Golf, Volleyball, Cheerleading, and Track & Field) camps and programs, providing countless ways for your child to grow. The formats of our 11 different sports camps and programs include traditional weeklong summer day camps and year-round after-school programs that range from 45 minutes to 6 hours in duration, per day. Our progression of camps and programs, led by our expert staff, are geared toward youth looking for a sport introduction or those who want to refine and master their sport-specific skills. Skyhawks Sports has proven to be the leader in youth sports since 1979. One of the things that makes Skyhawks trustworthy is that we go the extra mile to focus on safety, and we have a long-standing proven safety track record and processes to prove it. Safety highlights include: Pioneering industry standards since 1979 for safety and curriculum Holding the health and safety of our campers in the highest regard Generating glowing consumer testimonials This was the best camp! My child was totally entertained and engaged at all times!! The coaches were prepared and had endless energy! Loved it!!! - Sarah (Granite Bay, CA) All of our fond memories have been possible because of parents like you with your wonderful children.

Although he avoided the rebellious phase often associated with adolescence, he believed that through his own righteousness, he could develop a relationship with the Lord. But then, on a Saturday night in 1968, everything changed. Andrew realized he had fallen into the bondage of legalism and began confessing his self-righteousness, expecting the wrath of God to fall. Instead of wrath, however, God’s presence flooded him with love. “God’s love consumed me,” he says. “When I was at my worst, God’s love was the strongest.” This encounter changed his life forever and motivated him to follow God’s leading in his life. He decided to leave college, even though that meant losing his student deferment. Drafted into the Army and shipped to Vietnam, he served as a chaplain’s assistant. Despite how difficult and dangerous things were on the front lines, God used that time to ground Andrew in His Word and begin establishing the course of his life.","Education, Other, Social Impact",1,Andrew Wommack,501-1000,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
