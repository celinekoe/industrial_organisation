Goals Plastic Surgery,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/goals-plastic-surgery,"Cosmetic Surgery, Health Care","New York, New York, United States",At Goals Plastic Surgery they have managed to turn New York City into an almost brand new destination for aesthetic enhancement surgeries. ,"392,422","Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",Less than $1M,Active,2005-01-01,day,,,,,For Profit,https://goalsplasticsurgery.com,"Cosmetic Surgery Consultations and What They Mean to You! At Goal Plastic Surgery by far, one of the most important aspects - if not the most important aspect - of any cosmetic procedure is the consultation. No matter what type of procedure you, as a patient, may have in mind at Goals Plastic Surgery our staff puts the most emphasis on the opening consultation. As is the case with any first time meeting, your consultation is often your introduction to your surgeon and an introduction to the steps and what is entailed in your procedure. This is especially the case if this your first procedure ever or just with this particular surgeon. At Goals Plastic Surgery we take the initiative to ensure our clients are fully educated on their procedures, from top-to-bottom. The staff at Goals Plastic Surgery makes sure the client is fully aware of what they are getting into, and aren’t taking the decision lightly as it is a tremendous life decision physically, mentally, as well as financially. It is vital that clients are well researched on the procedure, the facility/practice, and the surgeon who is performing the procedure. Whether you are in the NYC area and choose Goals Plastic Surgery as your practice, or go elsewhere - there are a few specific takeaways, and signs you should always look for from your consultation. •	Make sure you’re a surgeon is open and honest about his experience and credentials. At Goals Plastic Surgery, Dr. V is extremely forthcoming with his experience and his history. If you come across a doctor or surgeon who seems to be secretive, and less than forthcoming with his or her history, this is a huge red flag. This may mean they have a huge negative on their record, or there may not be board-certified or may have even lost their medical license! (its happened before!). Ask how long they’ve practiced, where they were trained, certifications, qualifications of those who assist them, etc.  •	Ask to see the facility and pay close attention to everything! All facilities must be accredited, for the safety of each client. Pay close attention to the cleanliness, safety standards, quality of equipment, the size of the space, etc. if you don’t feel comfortable, leave! •	Surgeons and staff are upfront, honest, and thorough about every detail and aspect of the procedure. Make sure they aren’t trying to get one over on you by using slick, hard-to-follow conversation, or gloss over important details. The surgeons and staff at Goals Plastic Surgery ensure they thoroughly explain every detail to the client, from risks & rewards, providing patients with a list of options, detailed explanation of costs, and more!  •	Make sure your surgeon listens to you and trusts you. Many surgeons will try to overtake their clients and flaunt their expertise in front of your face. As a customer, paying thousands of dollars to have potentially risky surgery - you absolutely have the right to voice your opinion and feel comfortable enough with a surgeon who values clients enough to hear them out and politely & sincerely answer their concerns. •	Make sure your surgeon isn’t pushy or overly anxious to push more surgery on you. Often times at Goals Plastic Surgery our surgeons must try to stifle and put a list on the amount of surgery a patient can receive at one time. This is important for safety, and health of the client. Many unscrupulous surgeons will try to make as much money, and perform as much surgery on you as possible -whether it affects your health, safety, hurts you financially, or sacrifices the results of your main procedures.  •	Before & Afters! Any good surgeon is proud of their work. At Goals Plastic Surgery our surgeons are constantly flaunting their before and after, probably more than the patients themselves! You should have access to as many before and afters as possible - more than just a few seen on the practice website! •	The consultation room and the practice itself should be inviting. Plastic surgery is a lucrative business, no matter who you are. Any good practice invests in themselves enough to provide patients with a clean, modern, sleek, well-decorated practice with an inviting consultation room and friendly staff. Without a strong facility, you should be wary of the surgeon and the practice itself. At Goals Plastic Surgery we believe in our facility being a reflection of our practice - as an authority on aesthetics, it would be sad to have an ugly office.

Originally a systems integrator engaged by Global 1000 enterprises to monitor, manage, and maintain vast enterprise networks, using existing platforms, Auconet recognized the need for a better approach.  Auconet’s customers had been unable to find any truly vendor-independent solution for network management. Instead, customers were locked into proprietary network management solutions that each hardware vendor offered to monitor, manage, control, and secure its own devices. The resulting vendor lock-in created unacceptable risk, cost, and inconvenience. Auconet’s Global 1000 customers were looking for a better approach. Auconet studied its customers’ challenges in depth, and developed the Auconet Business Infrastructure Control Solution (BICS). BICS not only provides network infrastructure management for all vendors’ devices and endpoints, but also serves as the foundation for a new generation of IT infrastructure management. Auconet is trusted by industry leaders, including Siemens, DHL, Deutsche Bahn, BASF, and ING for real-time monitoring, control, security, and management of their complex IT infrastructures. Auconet BICS’ robust next-generation platform transforms IT infrastructure management from a cacophony of archaic ITSM and single-purpose tools, to a simplified, streamlined solution that dramatically improves productivity and lowers TCO.","Data and Analytics, Design, Information Technology, Privacy and Security, Software",1,Frank Winter,101-250,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,1,Private,,,,,,
