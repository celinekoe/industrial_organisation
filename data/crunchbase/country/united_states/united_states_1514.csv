I started a company, sold a company, worked for the company I sold to and now have launched another company all in the last seven years.  I will tell you, I have learned a ton and now want to offer a simple solution to those who struggle with social media, SMS, email, etc.  It can be really overwhelming with all the options businesses have to communicate with their customers, that's why I created OptSpot. OptSpot is basically an Option Spot or you could call it an Opportunity Spot, but whatever you call it doesn't really matter as much as how it works.   I found after working with thousands of businesses the one common thread of those who have been successful with LSM are those who IMPLEMENT. It really doesn't matter what product or service you provide or how much it costs, even if it's free. If you don't implement, it will never work.  I see over and over again franchisees and business owners who are busy running day to day operations just trying to keep their heads above water, let alone trying to learn a new marketing strategy.  That is where OptSpot comes in.  It's very simple.  There's no marketing material to print, no hassling customers trying to talk them into pulling out their phones to Opt-In to a text campaign, scan a QR code or fill out some form on a website. All you need to do is put their Kiosk Tablet on your counter and give your customers the Option on how they want you to communicate with them. Personally, I strongly recommend offering them the option to simply enter their phone number to 'Join the Club'.  When they do this, they are basically giving you their most coveted piece of personal information, their mobile phone number!","Advertising, Apps, Information Technology, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Messaging and Telecommunications, Mobile, Sales and Marketing, Software",1,Levi McClendon,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The company offers a full range of logistics services to support companies in all phases of a shipment’s storage and delivery lifecycle. The company is known for its use of technology to improve user satisfaction, striving to give customers an “Uber-like” experience. The company’s main digital platform is known as TruckHub and was developed in-house after the company’s founder, Luis Lopez, was unable to find an existing application to meet all of the needs of his customers. The advanced software allows users to track and manage their shipments through a wide variety of metrics. This high degree of usability is accomplished, in part, through a development process that takes in customer feedback and strives to build the platform in a manner that speaks directly to their needs. Freight Hub Group is composed of multiple subdivisions that enable the company to specialize its operations in four major areas — drayage, storage, full truckload shipping, and last-mile shipping. Together, these four focuses allow customers to utilize the company’s offerings to fully manage their shipments from pickup to delivery. Dray Hub, the company’s drayage subdivision, operates out of the Port of Miami and Port Everglades. It offers customers access to a range of storage options that can accommodate cargoes of many different sizes. This access includes the use of a large storage yard that can hold more than 450 containers at a time and has full use of industrial-capacity tools such as heavy-duty forklifts. These efforts complement offerings by WHSE Hub, the company’s storage subdivision, which provides a number of short-term and long-term storage options for specialized cargoes. FTL Hub and LTL Hub handle the company’s shipment operations. Operating nationwide, the company offers shipment delivery to the entire 48 contiguous states through its full truckload shipping. Last-mile shipping allows customers to handle local deliveries and event logistics in the South Florida area. These services include airport transfers, bonded and liquor-licensed deliveries, and access to specially trained and sanctioned drivers for the transport of hazardous materials.","Administrative Services, Real Estate, Transportation",1,Luis Lopez,101-250,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Kansas Gas Service was formed in 1997 when ONEOK, Inc. purchased natural gas assets from Western Resources. It has been known by a variety of names – Gas Service Company, Kansas Gas and Electric Company, KPL and KPL Gas Service – with a 100-year tradition of utility service to customers in Kansas, western Missouri and northeastern Oklahoma. Kansas Gas Service is a division of ONE Gas, Inc. (NYSE: OGS), a natural gas distribution company and the successor to the company founded in 1906 as Oklahoma Natural Gas Company, which became ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE) in 1980. ONEOK separated its natural gas distribution business in January 2014 to create ONE Gas, one of the largest publicly traded, 100 percent-regulated natural gas utilities in the United States. Kansas Gas Service is committed to being an organization that strives for excellence. Their industry is evolving. There is greater competition and greater customer choice. These changes will yield exciting new opportunities to serve the customers who have trusted us as their reliable source of natural gas. They value that trust. It's been earned by their employees who have made it their business to satisfy customers year after year. Safety and environmental performance are their top priorities, and they work hard to deliver natural gas service with no adverse effect on the public, their customers, employees or the environment. So when the Office of Pipeline Safety issued a final rule requiring natural gas pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs for natural gas transmission pipelines in high-consequence areas, Kansas Gas Service created an integrity management program that meets or exceeds the requirements of the integrity management regulations.","Energy, Sustainability, Transportation",,,1001-5000,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
