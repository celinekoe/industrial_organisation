Track, Research and Improve your cars fuel mileage with others in an easy to use web application. We offer 3 ways to add fillups. Website, Mobile site (works on ALL smartphones), and text message. Not everyone has a data package for their phones so we wanted to come up with a way for them to be able to remotely add fillups. Also you receive a text back with the MPG for that trip. So you don't have to wait until youâ€™re around a computer to see your MPG for that trip. We also have a full mobile site. Basically anything you can do on our main site you can do from your mobile phone. We just released our android app last month to make it easy for Google phone users. Just search the app market for ""fuel mileage"", our app is ""The Fuel Mileage Tracker"". We are just about ready to launch our BlackBerry app as well. Also when adding your vehicles you have the opportunity to add a list of modifications. So others can see if your vehicle is completely stock opposed to one that isn't. In regards to searching for other vehicles, I like to think our method/options are more in line with how the user would want to search. We have 2 options. First you can drill down on Make, model then vehicle. Our 2nd method allows you to search for a keyword. So rather than have to search through a page with tons of makes and manufactures you can simple to a ""keyword"" search and it will return every make/model/vehicle in the database that matches the keyword as your typing, which seems to save time. With regard to reporting, we have segmented into 2 types. One being ""My Reports"" which is specific to your username. Detailed analytics including graphing based on your vehicle(s). One report in general that is very useful is the ""Monthly Cost Breakdown"" report that details total fillups, distance, average mpg, total cost and cost/mile for each month you have been tracking.

Philips is currently limited to Home Depot in the physical retail space and online lamp catalog sites such as bulbs.com and 1000bulbs.com. In Home Depot, Cree and store brand LEDs are Philips main competition. None of the current market channels educate the consumer sufficiently to make the best choice of LED for their application.  Enersave is in discussions with environmental organizations to team to introduce their members to LED lighting in order to reduce electric bills, lower their carbon footprint and combat Climate Change.  Enersave is also recruiting independent agents, primarily college students, to distribute coupons and door hangers for a fee and a sales commission on sales their efforts generate.  Our goal is to achieve a minimumof 1000 agents, primarily in the higher electric cost regions of the US.  Each agent will be able to sell our products using our app and a card reader in addition to distributing sales literature. www.myLEDhome.com will ship Philips LED products from its fulfillment partner direct to consumers and accept back incandescent lamps and CFLs containing mercury for proper disposal using our delivery packaging for the return.  Pilot distribution of door hangers and flyers is underway in New York City and New Jersey.
