Now more than ever, individuals and companies recognize the need for behavior change supported by professionals such as health and wellness coaches. These coaches depend on a high degree of continual, personal contact with clients; however, they are limited in both scale and effectiveness by tools available to them today. Coaches unanimously acknowledge that the most critical period for behavior change efforts is in between meetings with the coach, when the coach and client have the least contact. However, they currently do not have any tools for engaging with their clients in between sessions, and monitoring their progress. Due to this lack of communication, clients fail to reach their goals and coaches struggle to retain unmotivated and unsatisfied clients.","Health Care, Information Technology, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment",3,"Adam K.
