They are able negotiate and close their own deal.  No need to wait for sales, coupons or discounts.  Approved by eBay as compatible.  Buyers and Sellers are prevented from closing large number of transactions because they are not able to negotiate with each other in real time.  When a seller offers a product above what the buyer is willing to pay a sale is lost, when the price is too low a margin is lost. A tool is needed that will allow buyer and seller to negotiate and achieve an equitable price. OfferJar provides that tool.   There is no other application available which provides this service.   OfferJar is an innovative and new automated negotiations platform. By using a proprietary 2-way bidding algorithm, OfferJar aims to bring online retail to a new level of collaborative deal-making. Current online retailers suffer from gaps in product pricing and buyer willingness to pay. There is a lack of information that allows sellers to appropriately determine the best price to offer each individual consumer, as such, many sales are left on the table. Under all available applications there is a delay of hours, sometimes days to get a response to buyers’ offers. Because of that, very often the buyer completes the transaction at another venue.  If it doesn’t work fast you into the next thing.   OfferJar allows sellers to upload any and all unsold items and uses a seller directed toughness scale to offer negotiated discounts to buyers.  This allows the seller, at no cost in labor once it is set on auto-pilot, to achieve a sale that would otherwise not have occurred, and turn inventory over faster.

Chris currently resides in Rothsay, MN with his wife, Terri, and daughters, where he serves as Mayor and a standing board member of the Rothsay Economic Development Authority. Over his years working as an IT technician providing standard break-fix services, Chris became increasingly dismayed as he watched companies spiral into chaos when problems with their servers, desktops or other devices cropped up. Because these businesses had no indication that problems were looming and couldn’t have addressed the issues if they had, they suffered serious production losses and encountered severe customer dissatisfaction that often put their businesses at great financial risk. Deciding there had to be a better way to do business, Chris focused his company’s efforts on providing Managed Services in order to help businesses reach their full potential by providing ongoing services such as remote monitoring, maintenance and prevention that save them thousands of dollars in emergency service fees and downtime.
