Solution:  Our system denies all unauthorized physical access to the unit, especially under extreme conditions such as: riots, fire, theft, and worst.   #2:  Desktop devices (even laptops) takes up needed surface space thus denying surface space to be used for other things… like work.   Solution:  Our system takes up “0%” of the work surface, even while it’s in use.   #3:  The lack of “Individuality” in the appearance of the high-tech device.     Solution:  Our systems, like automobiles, can be ordered to fit the taste and style of the End-User. #4:  Some End-Users face “real threats”, in their homes, offices, businesses, military installations, posts, HQ, embassies, etc.   Solution:  If required, our systems can offer a “Last Ditch” opportunity to save         the life of the End-User with an option we call the “Personal Bunker™”.     #5:  What if you can’t decide which device is best for you; especially when your needs are constantly changing.  And why should you “have to         choose” which type of device you need, when you can have it all.   Solution:  Our innovative “Advanced Integrated Mobile System™” (AIMS) allows the End-User to create their “Perfect” system.   #6:  Finding a single company that has a system, or “combination” of systems that will solve all of the above problems.   Solution:  Just one company can do this;  INVISIBLE COMPUTERS & ELECTRONICS, LLC  (ICE/Global) I have developed a device that places all of your information and communication needs at your fingertips when needed, and out of sight when not in use.

For corporate retail: Twisplays are one-line LED signs that display Twitter streams in order to strengthen brands and boost sales. Twisplays can be installed in any chain of retail stores or department store doors in order to broadcast your brand's or companyâ€™s Twitter stream to consumers. Twisplays extend the reach of your brand's or companyâ€™s Twitter stream, creating interest for consumers to follow your brand's or companyâ€™s Twitter stream, while also influencing consumer purchasing decisions at the point-of-sale. Twisplays can be used to draw attention, drive traffic and inform consumers of specials, promotions, discounts, coupons, contests, new products, sustainability efforts and company news. Twisplays extend your brand by encouraging consumers to take your brand home with them by following your brandâ€™s Twitter stream on their cell phone and computer. Twisplays enable brands, advertisers and sponsors to create ad hoc networks such as In Bar Network, Convenience Store Network, Mini Market Network and Salon Network. Twisplays provide unbeatable point-of-sale exposure, allowing companies to reach consumers at the critical point where product, consumer and money converge. Sponsors can partner with corporate retail chains to strengthen brands and increase sales. Twisplays can also be used in offices to follow what people are saying about your products - or to follow what people are saying about the competition.

Unlike most digital advertising platforms today, where content is in one place and advertisements in another, on Vrtii, the advertisement is the content. When users come to Vrtii, they come specifically to play games that will win them coupons and promotions from the brands they are already interested in connecting with. Vrtii is a true win-win solution, offering value to players and advertisers alike: For players, Vrtii is a fun, easy, engaging way to turn virtual-world gaming into real-world rewards. For advertisers, Vrtii is a low-expense, high-rewards approach to creating the kinds of interactions that turn into meaningful, lasting customer relationships. How it works: The Vrtii experience starts with the user: users come to the Vrtii app on their smartphone, play a fun, entertaining mobile game, and when they are done with the game, they are rewarded with a coupon from one of Vrtii's partner brands or businesses. Once Vrtii users “win” a coupon, they have several options of what to do with it, including redeem it immediately, save it for later, exchange it for something else, or give it to a friend. And this is where where the Vrtii approach to advertising becomes truly revolutionary for advertisers: before users can redeem a coupon, they have to activate it, and advertisers only pay for the coupons that players activate. So unlike with other advertising platforms, where advertisements are a gamble and companies pay the same amount regardless of whether the coupon gets results, on Vrtii, advertisers only pay for coupons that are going to translate into real, meaningful customer interaction. And that's not the end of the value that our platform provides for businesses: our platform also provides powerful back-end tools that allow companies to monitor user behavior and response to their promotions, and give them the ability to target coupon delivery to specific audiences to maximize user engagement and effectiveness.","Advertising, Apps, Commerce and Shopping, Gaming, Mobile, Platforms, Sales and Marketing, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

A full Executive Summary, Business Plan and Private Placement Memorandum are available upon request.  The Pyromaniac, LLC  will provide top quality Hearth, Patio & Barbecue products and services to both residential and commercial accounts. The principal officer of The Pyromaniac, LLC  knows that many homeowners struggle with their home heating during the colder months, and often are forced to keep their homes much cooler than they would like, creating an uncomfortable living situation.  We believe in helping people to recapture and enjoy their homes during the cold months, as well as to further enjoy their homes outdoors during the warmer months. We believe in challenging the status quo of the standard, unorganized way that customers are served within the hearth industry, that they should be taken care of from start to finish with the homeowner’s risk reduced to zero.  However, most companies leave much of the risk on the homeowner, primarily by not previewing their home before the installation of their product. This often leads to incomplete jobs that are dragged on for days or weeks, increased cost to the homeowner, and inefficiencies within the business. This is often caused by poor systems and processes within the company, and a low retention rate of quality employees. Both lead to low customer satisfaction, lack of repeat business, and a low word of mouth referral rate. The Pyromaniac, LLC  believes that by implementing this retail business plan, it can improve upon these consumer needs & competitor weaknesses to gain considerable local market share and achieve a rapid growth rate.
