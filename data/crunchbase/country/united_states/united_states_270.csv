It can drive 2-2.5% improvement via identifiable source of data, non-tampered documents and cost-reduction (& improved cash flows by 25-60 days) due to avoidance of repeated validation of same documents as loans change hands from origination to securitization.  Mortgage origination is highly inefficient as it changes hands from originator/broker, to the warehousing bank, to investors, the servicers, to the agencies (Freddie/Fannie) & increasingly the Hedge Funds. The same mortgage documents are subject to repeated appraisals, underwriting and validations due to lack of security, trust in the system, and inadequate understanding of exact composition of loans. This entails duplicative costs, stuck cash-flows and a system based on distrust across the chain. Moreover,  homes gets refinanced every 3.6years (av.) but only 18% of borrowers go to the same lender  - poor customer retention across entire home-mortgage ecosystem. We run the entire loan origination documentation on blockchain making the platform the source of immutable & undeniable provenance for all mortgage documents. This  makes the loan process quicker & easier with improved borrower retention by 3X,  reduces time of closure on refinance, reduces duplicative costs and releases cash-flows for lenders in selling their loans to the investors, who in turn can convert loan pools faster and cheaper into mortgage backed securities (MBS),  traded by secondary market players. This helps manage rate-risks and market-risks more efficiently across the mortgage chain. There are many other related benefits configured too.","Commerce and Shopping, Financial Services, Information Technology, Real Estate, Software",1,Alok Kumar Sinha,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Audio Design Desk,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/audio-design-desk,"Audio, Film, Music, Software, Video Editing","West Hollywood, California, United States",Audio Design Desk is an AI-Assisted content creation tool.,"288,278","Greater Los Angeles Area, West Coast, Western US",,Active,2018-01-01,month,,,,,For Profit,https://add.app,"Audio Design Desk is an AI-Assisted content creation tool that reinvents the process of connecting audio to video, turning hours of frustrating work into minutes of inspired fun. It is an entirely new breed of Digital Audio Workstation that artists can play like an instrument, revolutionizing how sound for video is produced, refined and delivered. Our powerful AI engine notices users’ likes and dislikes, so over time, Audio Design Desk gets to know each user’s taste. It comes bundled with over 20,000 sounds embedded with patent-pending Sonic Intelligence™, which makes our groundbreaking technology possible. Audio Design Desk’s intuitive and innovative content creation tools empower filmmakers, sound designers, composers, and creators to produce cinema-quality compositions at the speed of thought, giving them a level of creative control that is unmatched by any other software. Here’s how it works: Every sound in the add.app library is assigned identifying characteristics and carries an embedded sync point, which means that as sounds are previewed and chosen, they automatically land on the timeline in the exact right position relative to the video. The user simply imports a video file into the app and presses keys on their keyboard—H for hits, R for rises, D for drones, or users can assign sets of sounds to their numeric keys. The user can then strike the keys to position sound elements in real-time while watching the video playback—in effect, using the QWERTY keyboard like a Smart Sampler. For users who would rather select audio manually, add.app can search, audition and place sounds right from the timeline, completely eliminating the need to parse through libraries, import sounds and then find where they sync. Once a composition is set, add.app understands where sound connects to video and, by adjusting replacement criteria such as intensity, complexity, genre or feel, Audio Design Desk can use its Sonic Intelligence™ to instantly turn a single composition into infinite alternates without losing sync. Perhaps the most mind-blowing of all, add.app uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and has built the foundation for Machine Learning (ML) to understand which sounds a user likes and which sounds they reject so, over time, add.app will learn and adjust to its user’s taste.  add.app seamlessly integrates with the industry’s leading NLE software, including Adobe Premiere Pro, Apple Final Cut Pro, Apple Logic, DaVinci Resolve, Avid Pro Tools, and Avid Media Composer, with frame.io integration coming soon. add.app also works with hardware controllers like the Elgato Stream Deck, which makes the process of adding sound effects via keystrokes even easier.  Audio Design Desk is a SXSW Innovation Awards Finalist and winner of a 2020 NAB Show / Pro Sound News Best of Show Award. Already being used by editors at Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Originals, add.app is fueling creativity everywhere. WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING Academy Award-nominated editor Matthew Cooke: “There isn't another piece of software that allows you to instantly create at this level of professionalism.” Sound Effects Editor of ZERO DARK THIRTY Jamie Hardt: “Audio Design Desk is the tool I’ve been looking for my entire career.” Mix Magazine: “Expertly designed,” “groundbreaking application that significantly speeds up the act of accurately adding sound effects and music to picture” ProAudioFiles: “A new paradigm for audio post production” Redshark News: “A breathtakingly effective idea for sound designers” Pro Video Coalition: “Represents an entirely new breed of Digital Audio Workstation—or DAW—that uses AI-assisted content creation tools to enable filmmakers, editors, sound designers and creators to produce cinema-quality sound in seconds""","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio, Software, Video",3,"Gabriel Cowan, Ryan Francesconi, Samuel Music",1-10,1,,,,,,USD,,Creative Destruction Lab (CDL),1,1,,Private,,,,,,

Building on a platform of decades of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and self-monitoring research, they sought to deliver ‘what works’ in an engaging and elegant way on mobile devices. A simple observation - that the tedium associated with pen-and-paper monitoring detracts from treatment engagement - evolved into Recovery Record, the world’s number one mobile application for eating disorders. As thousands of people became engaged, they wanted to share their progress and collaborate with their treatment team. One day it dawned on us, what if the rich patient data being collected was placed in the hands of treatment teams? That’s where Recovery Record Clinician comes in. They have created a mobile-first patient management experience from the ground up - challenging assumptions about how clinical decisions are made, and designing an interactive and integrated treatment platform. They have taken the very best experiences from the apps they use everyday and applied them to best practice treatment methods. It’s a new, time saving, efficiency-creating model for treatment delivery. And it is deployable in minutes. Within one year of launch, the Recovery Record system has attracted over 10,000 eating disorder treatment professionals and 300,000 people living with eating disorders. And that is just the beginning. Their goal is to put Recovery Record in the hands of the millions of people worldwide who need it and want it. That means partnering with treatment providers, health plans, and research institutes, adding new features, and continuing to scale and innovate quickly. Thank you for joining us on the journey to transform eating disorder care. They are very excited for what lies ahead.",Health Care,2,"Jenna Tregarthen, Stuart Argue",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
