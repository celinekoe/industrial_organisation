RDI Consultants and families who wish to participate in RDI, can now do so through the use of RDIconnect's online web-based application, called RDIos. RDIos includes the RDI curriculum embedded into the application which allows RDI Consultants to track development and learning progress, communicate and collaborate on new methods of progress and research and allow the community to grow more knowledgeable, thus enriching families lives globally. RDIos provides video-sharing between parents and their assigned RDI Consultant that allow for revolutionary assessment and treatment methods unique to the traditional brick-n-mortar clinical office visit. The Internet now gives families the ability to form the same relationship with a clinician via the web, as if the clinician were in an office just down the road.  RDIconnect's next steps are to pilot RDIos in a school setting in LA, adding a team communication concept with Teachers, Consultants and families to utilize the same RDI principles and track progress with children, while they are at home and at school, thus getting everyone involved in the child's devlopment.

The second was to leverage the power of technology to create a simple and seamless solution for attorneys, their staff and doctors.    As a practicing attorney, who has also received recognition as a Rising Star Super Lawyer in California, I realized time and again that there was no easy way for me or my colleagues to find doctors that worked on liens.  Besides Chiropractors, there was absolutely no practical way to find any other medical specialties on lien throughout the state.   Power Liens was born out of a desire to address this very need.  Today, less than two years later, there continues to be tremendous demand for our services by attorneys and their staff.  What previously took hours to complete, is now facilitated through our directory in a matter of minutes.  We now enjoy a loyal and highly satisfied customer base, and some of our users have even coined their own slogan for our Company – “created by an attorney for attorneys”.   Our success would not be possible without our dedication to our clients (screened and quality rated health care providers), who in turn provide exceptional service to their patients.

It was the result of the dream of a group of investors and friends who decided to recuperate the ancient Greek and Roman bath tradition and revive this concept in restored historic buildings. AIRE creates spaces and experiences to relax the body and mind according to ancient traditions of water with temperature contrasts as elements of relaxation and health. Aire de Seville was the first center and it was opened on the street called “AIR”, which gave the name to the whole business group. It is situated in an old mansion from the sixteenth century that a wealthy “Indiano”- the name for the men who made wealth in the Indies- built on the foundations of a Roman ruin from the first century AD (now where Flotarium is located) The building was completely rehabilitated to house the baths. After Seville, in 2008 Aire de Barcelona was inaugurated. This time the Baths were located in a former meat storage area of El Born Market where century old wells that had supplied the city with water were found. Under the brick vaults the Baths were situated in a careful process of the building restoration. The third AIRE arrived in Almería in 2011, this time in the Old Town Square in the center of the city. The bath has its own boutique hotel. The last center is in New York, a textile factory in TriBeCa, Manhattan. This building built in 1883 opened its doors in 2012 to Aire Ancient Baths New York. Each AIRE is unique, located in an old building full of history and personality, but all of them share the quest to create a space for relaxation, full of calm and serenity in an experience for the senses.","Other, Professional Services",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
