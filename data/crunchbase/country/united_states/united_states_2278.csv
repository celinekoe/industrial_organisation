Do you want to find people with interest like yours? Maybe you are looking for one? Or maybe you hobby became your lifestyle or your work (lucky you!)? Most of us when asked about hobbies, will answer 'I do not have one'. But this is not true... Hobby is like a too big word for everyday interests and lifestyle. If you are passionate about something it is you hobby. It does not have to be collecting stamps or anything like that. Working in your garden to make it look all nice and pretty is a hobby already; or experimenting with cooking to impress your loved ones. Hobby is anything that makes you relax, happy and takes your mind away form everyday troubles... Sometimes would be cool to talk to someone who the same as you likes to dig in a garden, read long time forgotten classical literature or simply cycle around for a pleasure. This is why we have decided to start our own social networking website HobbyThing.com for people who would like to share their hobbies, interests and lifestyle. And not only that, if your hobby is your work (again: lucky you!) you can also create your profile, throw some pictures and write some stories about your experiences. We understand how difficult it is for a new business to kick off. We would like to help! We want to give a chance to hobbyists, who put their first steps turning their passions into professions. Members are more then welcome to advertise their work in their profile for free. They can also find others with similar interests, make friends and maybe get some advice on the subject too.
