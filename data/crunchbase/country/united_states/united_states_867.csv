We may only get to elect our representatives once every few years, but we vote with our wallets and our lifestyles every day. How should we decide what to do amidst a tsunami of information overload? Oroeco is founded on the premise that it should be easy, fun and rewarding to track how our everyday purchases, investments, and lifestyle decisions link up to our core values. We started as a group of friends, frustrated by the lack of information out there to help us sort out small improvements from big decisions. We didn't want to be activists or full-time volunteers for a cause, we just wanted to vote with our wallets and how we lived our lives. And we wanted to find fun ways to get our friends, family, and big companies to do the same. So with Oroeco we're creating a way to add everything up. The Oroeco tools will allow you to cut through marketing hype and dynamically track the impacts that you care about based on real data, get personalized suggestions for how you can do more good with less money, and engage in some constructive competition with friends, family, coworkers, and other communities. When you use Oroeco you not only help align your lifestyle with your values, you also encourage your friends and family to do the same. The more we all use Oroeco, the more our collective wallets encourage companies to demonstrate how they're aligning their business practices with our visions for a better tomorrow. In short, at Oroeco we're building you a dashboard for life. We think you have a right to know how your actions and your money intersect with your values and we think you deserve to be rewarded for your efforts to make our world a better place.","Community and Lifestyle, Energy, Professional Services, Sustainability",2,"Ian Monroe, Kirstin Cummings",11-50,4,Seed,40000,USD,40000,60000,USD,60000,"Elemental Excelerator, Start-Up Chile",1,2,,Private,,,,,,

We have corporate locations in Houston, Bangalore and Tel-Aviv, Israel.  Most of our dedicated staff is based in one of our two Bangalore offices, providing lead generation and other complimentary services to the US, Canada, UK, Israel, Germany, Australia, South Africa and India. The company was founded in 2006 with the vision that higher value services could be delivered from the outsourcing capital of the world â Bangalore, India. Our boutique sales services firm breaks the traditional cultural barriers when off-shoring key business functions. We believe in doing honest, high quality business while ensuring that each and every one of our customers profits from our services. re you a startup that is looking to bring your product to the US market but are not yet ready to pay the high costs of bringing on a US sales representative? Maybe you would like to conduct a few sales meetings on your own first with qualified prospects in order to get a feel for the target customer. Is your sales team not bringing in an adequate number of new prospects into the pipeline and therefore you would like to boost their productivity? Would you be able to better leverage your very expensive sales team if each sales rep had an additional 10-20 sales meetings a month with new accounts? Are you in a situation where you know that an inside sales team could help boost revenue but you cannot take the risk of paying the high salaries associated with a US inside sales team up front â not to mention the challenges around hiring and managing the team? Have your marketing activities not managed to open the sales pipeline and bring in as much activity as you had hoped? Have you spent thousands of dollars on advertising and with all of the visits to your website, you are still not receiving anything that your sales team can work with? If you are a company who is trying to target the US market and do not have the knowledge and expertise of âhow to get your foot in the doorâ of the US Fortune 2000 or small and medium businesses, we can help you access the market at a fraction of the cost of all other services. Why Lead to Market? We  provide you with the most professional and cost effective lead generation solutions to increase B2B transactions.","Advertising, Information Technology, Other, Professional Services, Sales and Marketing",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
