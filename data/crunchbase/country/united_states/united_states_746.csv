Ball State is ranked a research university, high research activity by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. Individual programs are accredited by various regional and national organizations.  At Ball State, they're more than just educators—they're educational entrepreneurs. Combining top-flight talent with the top-notch resources they have to offer, theirr students and faculty inject endless energy and creativity into what they teach and how they learn. The result—a university The Princeton Review calls one of the best in the Midwest.  To fulfill Ball State's mission of fundamentally changing their students, researchers and external partners, they offer comprehensive academic opportunities, including about 180 undergraduate majors and preprofessional programs and more than 100 master's and doctoral degrees. Ball State's programs in architecture, telecommunications, landscape architecture, education, entrepreneurship and online master’s degree in nursing are consistently ranked among the best in the nation. That excellence is only possible because of the quality of Ball State's faculty and their commitment to teaching. More than 90 percent of Ball State's classes are taught by professors. That's almost unheard of at an institution of Ball State's size.  Ball State believes that for an educational experience to be successful, it should be just that—an experience. So Ball State has made a unique commitment to immersive learning programs that incorporate research, projects with community partners and capstone experiences into the curriculum. Acting, musical theatre, and telecommunications students participate in talent showcases in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Students in Ball State's entrepreneurship program face the ultimate pass or fail test—to graduate, they must pitch a business plan that a panel of experts deems viable.  Ball State enrolls about 21,000 students, with more than 17,800 attending on campus. Students come from 48 states, two U.S. territories, about 43 countries, and every Indiana county. Out-of-state students make up about 13 percent of on-campus enrollment, and ethnic minorities comprise about 12 percent. The university enrolls more than 675 international students.  Today, Ball State’s entrepreneurial spirit continues to shine through numerous expansions and additions of degree offerings, technological resources, immersive learning opportunities, community outreach projects, and state-of-the-art facilities.

Dr Lipov, the Chief Medical Officer at Stella, is credited with innovating the Stellate Ganglion Block (""SGB"") as an intervention for trauma symptoms. After experiencing trauma, the way our brain functions may change in dramatic ways. In some cases, we become stuck in “fight or flight” mode - which can be observed in certain types of brain scans. It may be helpful to think about the sympathetic nervous system as being somewhat like an engine. Under normal conditions, we are in “neutral gear,” a relatively relaxed state not associated with feeling threatened. However, extreme stressors can shift and lock us into a higher gear, where we may remain for years or even decades. This state may involve “feeling constantly revved up and being unable to throttle down.” Common indicators of this altered biological state include symptoms like disrupted sleep, anger attacks, overwhelming panic, difficulties concentrating, a feeling of constantly being on “high alert”, and a strong startle response - in other words, the “hyper-arousal” cluster of post trauma symptoms. Stella’s adaptation of SGB involves injecting a widely available, commonly used anesthesia into a bundle of nerves in the neck, just above the collarbone. The injected medication has the short-term effect of soothing and “re-setting” the overactive nerves, operating in the same temporary way as the Novocaine administered by a dentist. To return to the earlier analogy, SGB seems to manually pop a “stuck gear” back into “neutral.”",Health Care,3,"Eugene Lipov, Michael Gershenzon, Stefan Weitz",11-50,1,,7000000,USD,7000000,7000000,USD,7000000,Sterling Partners,1,1,,Private,,,,,,
