Upgrading from analog to digital video distribution was costly and complicated; the ZeeVee team saw this as the primary disconnect between explosive emergence of HDTVs and customers' ability to access high quality video content. In a breathtaking development phase, they hired leading engineers in TV and broadcast technologies and harnessed the latest technology for digital signal processing. ZeeVee reverse engineered the typical video distribution system, launching ZvBox in May 2008 to widespread acclaim. Since then, the company has continued to revolutionize digital video distribution by producing products that are commercial grade, highly flexible, extremely reliable and incredibly cost-effective.","Hardware, Software",2,"Jeremy Greene, Steve Metzger",11-50,2,Early Stage Venture,,USD,,,USD,,"JLL Ventures, Alpond Capital",,2,,Private,,,,,,

In independent lab tests it was shown to absorb and dissipate energy, reduce the speed of impact, and deflect glancing blows to significantly reduce sports injuries.  Unlike competitors’ products, DYH’s ProCap is available in custom colors, is decal-friendly and is both heat and cold resistant. The core technology was spawned at a firm funded by private investors, physicians, and Ben Franklin.  That company merged into Defend Your Head in 2013 where the product was advanced and an additional patent was acquired.  Market launch is scheduled for late summer. DYH is led by John Roman who spent 9 years in the NFL, was President of Merrill Lynch Trust Company, and founded Valley Forge Capital Advisors.

The data is captured and imported into the proprietary ""IS Simple Specification"" format for product data.  This allows InventorySource.com to map the data into any ecommerce import structure from any wholesale distributor. On the retail side, Inventory Source has integrations with a growing list of shopping cart platforms (ie 3dCart, Shopify, Big Commerce, Magento, MagentoGO, Virtuemart, Zen Cart, Open Cart, Presta Shop, eBay ProStores, and more), as well as marketplaces like Amazon, eBay, Overstock, Price Grabber, etc. Between the supplier source and the sales channel, the Inventory Source system provides a GUI with push button controls. They allow the store owner to control category formats, price settings, product and brand filters and more.  A store owner or marketplace seller can control their inventory updates to the exact format they need.  Inventory Source then automatically loads the products and images and updates changes in price, quantity, and status for the retail catalog without any technical data management or code changes needed by the store owner. Along with the full automation services for wholesale dropship product data management, Inventory Source can add additional custom feeds for the inventory in any CSV, TXT, or XML format allowing imports for custom platforms, non-integrated stores, or any marketplace import requirement.
