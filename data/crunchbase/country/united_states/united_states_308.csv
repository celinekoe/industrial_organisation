As an industry leading manufacture for more than 20 years, Camp Chef produces high quality products offering efficient ways to cook for almost any outdoor gathering. From social functions to campouts or even dinner on the back patio, Camp Chef can do it all. In 1990, Camp Chef was established on the idea that there just had to be a better way to cook outdoors. We recognized many campers and sportsman had an interest in outdoor cooking but were struggling with what cooking equipment was available to them. That is when he designed a stove that would meet the needs of the avid outdoorsman. That simple stove design later became the Pro 60 and evolved to include the most versatile cooking system on the market by incorporating accessories to simplify and diversify any outdoor menu. BBQ boxes, flattop griddles, and pizza ovens now give users the ability to grill, griddle, bake, boil, brew fry, stream, and even cook Dutch oven - all on a single Camp Chef stove. After being in the campsite for nearly 10 years, Camp Chef began producing quality cast iron cookware with its signature True-Seasoned Finish. Another 10 years later Camp Chef addressed the demand for a versatile outdoor cooking system at home. Today there are several stoves, smokers, fire pits and more, designed specifically with the home and patio in mind. However, the roots of the company are in the great outdoors, continuing to give people the opportunity to experience nature without sacrificing a hearty meal. Camp Chef is located in the heart of Cache Valley, Utah, surrounded by the beautiful Bear River Mountain Range, a perfect site for product testing. Each product is a result of Camp Chef's dedication to outdoor cooking and its pledge to improve and create new products that fulfill the needs of its highly valued customers.","Commerce and Shopping, Food and Beverage, Sports",1,Ty Measom,11-50,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

At SWS Environmental Services (SWS) it is their mission to set the industry standard as the nation's premier turnkey environmental services provider utilizing their knowledge, experience and unparalleled customer support. Their team of highly trained, skilled professionals is dedicated to providing solutions of unmatched value consistently with a commitment to safety, reliability and the long-term growth and success of the company. As of June 20th, 2011, Eagle-SWS officially changed it's name to SWS Environmental Services. The new name and logo better conveys who they are and what they do. In November of 2008 with the merger of Southern Waste Services, Inc. and Eagle Construction and Environmental Services, L.P. a change in branding and services to Eagle-SWS was unveiled. Formerly conducting business as SWS First Response and Eagle Construction, SWS is the result of two leading environmental companies joining forces to create one of the largest environmental firms in the United States. With an expansive range of service centers in the Midwest, the North, the South, and along the Gulf Coast, they have significantly diversified their environmental services portfolio and greatly increased their ability to respond to their clients' environmental emergencies. With the merger of SWS completed and their new branding in full force, clients can expect a comprehensive set of environmental services available across a broad geographic area, maintaining the same commitment to safety, integrity, and customer service clients have come to expect. What started as a small domestic waste company in the early 1970s following the deployment of vacuum trucks to a series of oil spills eventually evolved into SWS First Response, a premier emergency response and environmental services contractor. Over the course of 30 years, the company expanded across six states and also developed an entire line of environmental services including site remediation, waste transportation & disposal, decontamination, industrial services and vacuum truck services. Beginning in 1981, Eagle Construction and Environmental Services was a small commercial construction company serving the West Texas region. After acquiring a variety of heavy equipment to meet a wide range of project needs and demands, Eagle developed into a leading full-service environmental company, providing practical environmental solutions in multiple states.","Real Estate, Science and Engineering, Sustainability",,,501-1000,2,M&A,23700000,USD,23700000,23700000,USD,23700000,"ShoreView Industries, Norwest Mezzanine Partners",1,2,,Private,,,,,,

Three Aspects of Automation You Might Have Missed Automation continues to gradually make its way into the mainstream. For example, commercials depicting homeowners monitoring their home remotely, setting thermostats based on useage and programming lights and music is quite mainstream, showcasing some of the nifty every day uses of machine-to-machine (M2M) technology and IoT gateways. The applications of building automation, however, go far beyond what you may have seen in advertisements. In fact, automation can be utilized by companies across nearly every vertical. What follows are a few “hidden” automation applications.   Payment Processing Automated payment systems supported by best-in-class gateways perform a wide range of functions, from facilitating faster credit card transactions to verifying customer membership in loyalty programs. Automated payment system applications also allow remote monitoring of point-of-service systems and terminals for security and performance assurance purposes. Printing  Print automation can increase employee productivity by allowing managers to create ironclad rules that govern business processes. For instance, a point-of-sale device can be set up to print a receipt any time a sale is entered. Or the printer in a commercial warehouse could be configured to print a packing slip when an order is confirmed in the system, eliminating the need for human intervention and error. Automated solutions can also collect and analyze data on a company’s printing, identifying areas of waste or inefficiency. Data Processing Data access and collection devices can enhance a business’s existing infrastructure by re-routing information over the Internet of private IP networks instead of dial-up lines. These devices allow for faster transfer of data and cost savings reaped by eliminating telephone lines. Best-in-class Dial-to-IP converters also come with SSL encryption to secure data and embedded back-up to protect against data loss.     If you were under the impression building automation was only good for monitoring HVAC or lighting systems from afar, perhaps it’s time to take another look. Because no matter what space you occupy, the technology holds some benefits for your business.","Information Technology, Internet Services, Other",1,Dean B. McDaniel,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
