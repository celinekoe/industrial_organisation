The Company seeks to become the company recognized for creating and introducing the technology that transformed not only the hydraulics industry, but hydraulics, itself, into the fastest and most efficient form of power transmission. In a breakthrough insight in 2001, Elton Bishop invented the Digital Hydraulic Transformer (DHT). Using a unique and simple linear reciprocating mechanism, the DHT is a paradigm shift from conventional rotary hydraulic transformer designs to convert hydraulic power from one flow and pressure to another flow and pressure. Simply put, the DHT allows cyclic use and re-use of hydraulic, potential and kinetic energies in manner that approaches proverbial ""perpetual energy"". As an example of the extreme efficiency the DHT allows, the retrofit of a prototype DHT into the hydraulic system of a forklift allowed over 70% reduction in the amount of prime mover energy required to complete standard workcycles. It is anticipated that, with further development, the DHT will allow energy savings of over 90%.",Energy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

The full size would be convenient for purses, desk drawers, and glove compartments.  The """"slim"""" or medium size would be for flushables/toddler/feminine wipes. This would replace the current trend of carrying these in plastic baggies.  And the smallest would be sold as a component piece to any cosmetic company that sells their own brand of facial/make-up remover wipes as a gift with purchase. This case is brandable with the in-mold design offering the ability to have corporate or personal logos and designs.    The word """"Oshibori"""" is the term for """"moist towel"""" in Japanese and refers to that lovely hot or cold towel one gets at the beginning of a meal.  To be able to have that convenience anytime, anywhere is what Oshiboree provides.  What makes Oshiboree different is that the case is not only beautiful, but it provides a seal to keep the wipes from drying out.  Because the artwork on the case is extremely customizable, the potential for designer prints and limited editions helps to maintain the high-end accessory nature of this product.  Baby wipes are not just used by moms and babies.  Most car owners like to have them handy.  Germ awareness is increasing in our country and abroad.
