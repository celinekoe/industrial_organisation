With the help of her optician friend (and future design collaborator) she set out to find the perfect pair. After carefully selecting her ideal frames, the final total left her with the type of sticker shock usually associated with a luxury sports car purchase or hotel mini-bar tab.  A frugal farm girl at heart, Julie couldn’t bear the thought of spending the GDP of a small country on an item that would inevitably end up lodged between the sofa cushions. When she inquired about a more reasonably priced alternative, she was directed to the rack at the local drugstore. The memory of what she saw there haunts her to this day…   As a successful woman with carefully curated personal style, didn’t her eyes deserve better? And there it was, her ‘a ha' moment. If what she was looking for didn’t exist, then she would just have to make it. Allinson quickly left her job at a children’s clothing company and set to work with a singular vision: to create a line of distinctive, high-quality reading glasses for people like her, the irreverent and slightly jaded.    Since starting eyebobs in 2001, that vision has become an all-consuming passion.  With tongue planted firmly in cheek, Allinson and her dedicated team of optical misfits live to outfit the eyes of the smart, sarcastic and style conscious among us. Frames range from buttoned up conservative to avant garde, each crafted with exceptional quality and a dose of Allinson’s signature wit and style. eyebobs were created for the square pegs. The black sheep. The people who dare to be unapologetically themselves. Put them on and you will get noticed. Wallflowers need not apply.    In March of 2015 eyebobs joined forces with Norwest Equity Partners, a leading middle market investment firm.  Also based in Minnesota, Norwest Equity Partners, or “NEP” as the cool kids call it,  has been investing alongside business owners and their management teams since 1961. This investment capital is a significant milestone for eyebobs and will fuel their next stage of growth.

Since before our founding in 2010, CHSI Technologies has been working to build technology for where the insurance industry is headed, not where it’s been.  That’s why CHSI was one of the first companies to build our $20 million software product on a cloud-based platform.     Our roots were established in the management and operations of insurance pools, captives, and insurance companies.  So, our deep experience and understanding of insurance operations serve us well in building technology that is responsive to the type of insurance operation it serves.  And our industry experience supports our clients well when it comes to deploying our technology into their unique environment in a meaningful way.   Our cloud-based technologies allow us to offer top-tier enterprise qualities to small insurer operations for a fraction of the cost of similar systems used by the mega-carriers.   Our product and approach ensures that small insurers can stick to their core competencies while enjoying the benefits of having a robust back-end system that serves as an integrated workforce multiplier… in other words, - higher, easier output - at a lower cost of operating.  Our lineage also facilitates our understanding of the budget constraints faced by most small insurer operations.  As a result, we have priced the product in a modular way that allows the customer to license only those features and components that best serves their current mission. And as the customer grows, they can add other modules and features as their business needs and demand evolve.    Today, our SaaS enterprise product is being used coast to coast by traditional workers’ comp carriers, P&C carriers, captive insurers, government risk pools, and self-insured groups.  We are honored to be recognized as a Top Ranked technology by numerous CIO and insurance industry publications, as well as having been voted as the winner of the US Captive Award in 2017 for technology.
