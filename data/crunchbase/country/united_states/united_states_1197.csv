We’re fanatical about fundraising and we genuinely care about your success which is reflected in our 98.7% rate of customer satisfaction. We’re committed to helping your group raise more! Quality Fundraising Products: Your group wants to sell products they’re proud of. Your supporters want value, and we give it to them! Many of your supporters are family, friends and neighbors – it’s only fair they receive the value you would expect. As well, satisfied supporters will order more product in future fundraisers if they’re satisfied with their initial purchase, which is crucial for repeat business. Our team carefully scouts and selects our quality fundraising products at the industry trade shows, which we attend a few times annually. The Right Fundraisers: Your group is unique, so your choice of fundraising products needs to be carefully considered. Amongst other criteria, we consider age, local demographics, past fundraising successes, your local fundraising competition, and your group’s personal preferences. We’ve expanded our fundraising product line to include frozen and non-frozen food products, healthier fundraisers, green fundraisers, massive holiday shoppers. Our price points vary from as low as $0.50, all the way up to $30. We offer in-hand direct-sellers, as well as order-takers. We’ve got the right fundraiser for you!
