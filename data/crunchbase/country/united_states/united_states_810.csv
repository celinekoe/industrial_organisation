This shipper has excellent reviews and many options to choose from, including motorcycle, classic and international shipping options. *How RCC Car Shipping Works* The basic process of shipping a car used to be a fairly laborious process, but RCC Auto Transport makes it easy. The steps are straightforward: Obtain a Quote - We’ll get into this deeper a bit later, but the quote tool on the website makes obtaining a quote super easy. Input your year, make and model, answer a few basic questions, and you’re provided an instant quote on the website, and you’ll also have a copy of that quote sent to your email. Book your Reservation - Walk through the step-by-step process of inputting your personal data. At the booking stage, you’ll be asked to choose a shipping date, but even if you’re not 100% sure of the date, you can change it later. Release the Vehicle - When your shipping date arrives, the truck will meet you at the agreed upon location. That can be at your home, or even your office. You and the driver will do an inspection of the vehicle at that time to agree upon any damage on the vehicle, and you’ll be asked to sign a Bill of Lading. At that point, the vehicle will be loaded, and the next time you see it will be at its final destination. Receive the Vehicle - Usually, within five to seven days, the truck will arrive at your destination. Similar to pick up, if your address makes it difficult for a large truck to deliver a car, you can also choose a mutually acceptable location like a large shopping center parking lot. When the vehicle is unloaded, you and the driver will inspect it a second time to check for any damage incurred during the ride. If none is evident, you sign the Bill of Lading again and you’re done.
