Adnectins are proteins designed to either block or stimulate therapeutic targets of interest to fight diseases across a broad range of therapeutic areas. Their proprietary technology for engineering these versatile proteins creates an opportunity to rapidly generate highly differentiated medicines. Adnexus, a Bristol-Myers Squibb R&D Company, is a leader in the discovery and development of Adnectins, a proprietary type of targeted biologic. Adnectins are proteins designed to either block or stimulate therapeutic targets of interest to help fight diseases across a broad range of therapeutic areas. Our proprietary technology for engineering these proteins creates an opportunity to rapidly generate compounds for study as potential treatment options for patients. Targeted biologics are one of the most medically important and fastest growing areas in the biopharmaceutical industry. These drugs are specifically designed to attack targets of disease. Despite the success of the first generation targeted therapeutic products, such as antibodies, additional innovations are sought by the medical community to help meet unmet needs for improved safety, and efficacy. We believe the study of Adnectins can help to address these demands. Adnectins are derived from human fibronectin, an abundant extracellular protein that binds naturally to a number of different proteins. We create Adnectins using our proprietary protein engineering system called PROfusion™. Our scientists can rapidly create PROfusion libraries of more than 10 trillion different Adnectins. We then screen these libraries to identify Adnectins with the desired drug properties against therapeutic targets of interest. PROfusion enables discovery productivity by minimizing the timeframe for identifying high-quality candidates. In October 2007, Adnexus was acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. This acquisition has further accelerated our growth as an industry leader in the discovery and early development of proprietary targeted biologics. Together with Bristol-Myers Squibb, we are developing multiple Adnectin programs for use in the study of potential treatments in a broad range of disease types, including oncology, immunology, and cardiovascular disease.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",2,"Gordon Wong, Noubar Afeyan",101-250,3,M&A,55500000,USD,55500000,55500000,USD,55500000,"Venrock, Flagship Pioneering, Polaris Partners, Atlas Venture, HBM Healthcare Investments AG",2,5,,Private,,,,,,

Poor food and nutrition is the single largest contributor to this epidemic (NIH 2015.) Employers and healthcare providers are looking for a solution to stem the trend of increased costs.    By using technology to engage people in a new way of thinking and learning about food—one that is inspiring, flavorful, and personal—we believe that large populations can be cost-effectively guided towards sustained, lifelong changes in behavior.  We’ve developed 5 strategies aimed at helping people, families, and teams improve their health through food by:       (1) expanding beyond healthy cooking       (2) recognizing the foundational importance of social connection       (3) shifting the focus from health to well-being       (4) incorporating the power of mindfulness       (5) building a holistic view on behavior change.  As a foundation for these strategies, we’ve developed a proprietary, science- and culinary school-based curriculum to deliver chef-inspired cooking lessons, how-to videos, cooking essentials and tips to power-up everyday meals. Our approach focuses on flavor, abundance, joy, and connection that surrounds the act of preparing and sharing good food.
