PPSC offers training programs in psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic psychotherapy and continuing education for professionals who are interested in utilizing psychoanalytic theory and technique to enhance their clinical work. PPSC believes that training in psychoanalysis is enriched through exposure to all major theoretical orientations and that openness to different approaches will greatly facilitate the growth and development of the student of analysis.  At the same time, PPSC emphasizes the importance of helping the candidate develop a consistent approach of his or her own. Therefore, the curriculum and study environment are formulated in such a way as to provide a solid grounding in basic psychoanalytic theory and to help students compare and contrast the significant contributions of the Freudian, Modern, Relational, Self Psychology and Object Relations schools of thought.  Contemporary developments in Intersubjectivity are also addressed.  This is done through a comprehensive synthesis of core and specialized classes, group supervision, personal analysis, individual supervision and personalized educational planning. The training environment encourages input and participation from the candidates who work with the PPSC administration to shape the program and address the professional needs of the student body. The faculty and supervisory staff at PPSC have come from a variety of institutes with different training orientations, and practice throughout the Metropolitan area. Their affiliation here represents a respect for diversity, change, and a commitment to a candidate-oriented program. The programs consist of coursework, personal analysis, individual supervision and clinical work.  Upon completion of coursework, which is outlined below, candidates in the Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy program will complete a formal written case presentation of a control patient of their choice.  Candidates in the Psychoanalysis and LP programs submit a written presentation of a case incorporating a theoretical contribution, which addresses some aspect of psychoanalytic work of interest to them. Our core accomplishments include the provision of therapy services to over 4500 clients, the advanced training of over 75 psychoanalysts and psychoanalytic psychotherapists, and over 250 publications by community members in the field of mental health, social work and psychoanalysis. Today, PPSC has 75 faculty members and supervisors, who work with 60 full and part-time candidates.","Education, Health Care",,,101-250,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

But it isn’t an “achievement gap” as the media often describes it. It’s an opportunity gap. Students in upper-income families spend 300 more hours each year with adults than do the three million students in lower-income families. Upper-income students also benefit from almost $8,000 worth of enrichment activities yearly—robotics camp, piano lessons, academic tutoring, and more. They can close this gap, and help these three million students discover and achieve their dreams, by connecting students who want to learn and adults who have something to teach…families with big dreams and volunteers with big hearts…visionary school leaders and a non-profit with a proven model…citizens and schools.
