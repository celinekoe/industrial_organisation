"InvestAcure, PBC",https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/investacure,"Apps, Financial Services, FinTech","New York, New York, United States",InvestAcure is a finance company building a spare change investment platform to enable investment in companies working on curing Alzheimer's,"1,084,777","Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",$1M to $10M,Active,2017-08-14,day,,,,,For Profit,https://www.investacure.com/,"InvestAcure is a finance company building an investment platform to enable individuals who share a ‘Common Need’ to see progress in developing a cure for Alzheimer’s, to automatically round up purchases and invest the change in a portfolio of companies working on effective treatments. Its 3-year plan is to reach 1.7+ million users, investing $1 billion per annum to develop scientific innovations from basic research into lifesaving therapeutics. The company was founded in 2017 and based in New York. The problem we are solving: Alzheimer’s is the only top 10 cause of death with no treatment to cure or slow the disease - it’s 100% fatal! It is also the most expensive disease in the US, costing $277 billion in 2018 - as much as $1.1 trillion by 2050. Alzheimer’s must be cured! Yet, investment risk has led most major pharmaceuticals to cut back on Alzheimer’s R&D as unprofitable, while smaller scientist-led companies struggle to develop scientific discoveries into life-saving drugs. Does it make sense for millions to die helplessly, just because no one can reliably make a profit developing a cure? Our solution: JUST IMAGINE - what if drug companies were owned by millions of investors motivated by their ‘Common Need’ to see Alzheimer’s cured, with each investing just the spare change they don’t depend on for future financial needs - there would be billions in new investment to develop and test new drugs and cure would become the #1 priority above profit.  To realize this vision, InvestAcure is building a spare change investment platform to help you invest in companies working on a cure for Alzheimer’s. Just spare change: Your day-to-day transactions are rounded up to the nearest dollar & the spare change is deposited in your InvestAcure investment account.  Invest: With the guidance of leading scientists, your spare change is invested in a portfolio of companies working on developing innovative Alzheimer’s drugs & diagnostics. Ownership + Impact:  YOU own stock. YOU help advance progress to a cure. YOU have a fair share in any profit. We coined this new investment model, Common Need Investment (CNI), which refers to Investments made in a company based on its pursuit of essential work valued by the investors above financial profit or loss. If just 1.5% of the 70 million adults in the U.S. who have a relative with Alzheimer's become spare change investors, that would mean $600 million in annual investment - $3 billion over 5 years. Management Team Includes:   -	Max Tokarsky, CEO - 20 years social/non-profit entrepreneur, Founder/CEO @ RAJE, Wharton Cap Stone.  -	Ken Abramowitz, CIO - 40 years health sector investment leadership, Founder/MGP @ NGN Capital, Wall Street Hall of Fame, MBA Harvard Business School.  -	David Weild IV, Vice Chairman - 30 years Investment banking & capital markets leadership, Chairman & CEO of Weild & Co., Former Vice Chairman of NASDAQ, known as “Father of the JOBS Act.”  -	Yu-kai Chou, CXO - 15 years Gamification and UI/UX design leadership for world's leading brands, including Google, LEGO, eBay, Huawei, and Volkswagen/Porsche.   -	Yuri Yushkov, CTO - 25 years leading software development teams in building Core Banking, Wealth Management, Electronic Payments and Money Transfer platforms.  Scientific Advisory Board Includes:  -	Pierre Tariot, MD - Director of the Banner Alzheimer’s Institute. Over 350 scientific papers, including several leading to FDA approval of treatments for Alzheimer's.  -	Hugo Geerts, Ph.D - CSO of In Silico Biosciences, headed Johnson & Johnson Alzheimer’s research and developed one of only 5 approved Alzheimer’s drugs.  -	Lon Schneider, Ph.D - Director of USC State of California Alzheimer’s Disease Center and the National Institute on Aging Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center. Editor-in-chief of Alzheimer’s & Dementia. Business Advisory Board Includes:  -	Heidi V. Pickett, MIT Sloan Master of Finance, Asst. Dean - expert on corporate development, business strategy, and global operations. Served as Senior Managing Director at State Street Global Markets.  -	Peter McCrea, Cavendish Impact Foundation, President & Director - VP of Development at American Endowment Foundation, served on Board of Directors of Morgan Stanley Global Impact Funding Trust. -	Julie Fleming, Purple Sherpa, CEO & Founder - former patent litigator with a science background, and founder of a law-firm business consultancy.  Represented by Eversheds Sutherland on regulatory & IP issues: Eversheds Sutherland is a global top 40 law practice, with more than 2,800 lawyers, in 66 offices in 32 jurisdictions across Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States. We are deeply grateful to the partners at Eversheds Sutherland for their dedication and hard work in advancing the InvestAcure, PBC mission by providing their services on a pro bono basis. Business Model: Our business model is that of a Registered Investment Adviser (RIA). Users set up an online investment account & connect their credit card. Their day-to-day transactions are rounded to the nearest dollar and the spare change is set aside for investment. With the guidance of leading scientists, the funds are invested in companies working on a cure for Alzheimer’s. Our management fee is $2 p/month or a 1% annual fee for accounts over $5000. Sales & Marketing Strategy: To gain market traction our plan is to focus on individuals taking an active interest in Alzheimer’s related information and causes. This will be done through targeted ads on Facebook and Google, as well as through content-based marketing providing information on Alzheimer’s research. We will also work to build partnerships with caregiver support groups and develop own volunteer network, as well as seeking out celebrity endorsement. Competitive Advantage: While investment firms face stiff competition to provide for client’s financial needs, we target an easy to reach market, based on their affinity for a cause with a strong emotional appeal and do not ask anyone to abandon their existing investment advisors or brokerages. We are also not asking for a charitable gift, but rather for investment which while risky has the advantage of potential profit, as well as directly enabling progress to a cure. Intellectual Property: Patent filed for: SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR IMPROVING SOCIAL IMPACT INVESTMENT PLATFORMS Summary: A system for an investment platform that tracks both individual financial metrics, as well as the collective non-financial goal impact metrics for an entire community.
