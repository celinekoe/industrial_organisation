The company was founded in 2018 by a team of analysts and investment professionals who had formerly worked as part of a development group in a San Francisco angel capital office.  Previously, the team had been tasked with building various in-house data solutions, including one to supply structured XBRL financials to subsidiary Revere Data (later acquired by FACTSET).  It was through this experience that the basis of SDS as a standalone provider was born.   The lightbulb moment for the team came when it moved beyond standard financials (Income Statement/Balance Sheet/Cash Flow) and began mining esoteric tables buried in 10K/Qs, such as REIT FFO (Funds From Operations) for a hedge fund manager client.  Although outside of the ordinary workflow, SDS tools easily accomplished the task with a skeleton crew of staff and a microscopic budget (compared to incumbent data purveyors).  At that point, the decision was made to commercialize. Since 2018, SDS has been in stealth mode, quietly improving its semantic parsing engine and its user interface, while preparing for a public launch.  We intend to disrupt a well established and very static industry which currently relies mostly on manual processes to populate databases.

If you're looking to sell your home or investment property Wilson Property Solutions would love the chance to make you a no obligation cash offer to buy yours. We use the funds and resources of private real estate investors to buy properties. Wilson Property Solutions can help with any of these situations. ""Finding Solutions Is Our Business"". Wilson Property Solutions also specializes in wholesaling. Any home or investment property that does not fit our personal buying criteria we assign those contracts for a wholesale fee to another cash buyer investor in our large network. Our process is very simple.  You can either fill out our no obligation free property evaluation cash offer form or give us a call directly to give us information about the house or investment property that you want to sell. If the property is one that would fit either our investment criteria or another investor's in our network we will schedule to see the property.  When we meet you at the property we walk through and look at what repairs or other changes are necessary.  Using this information along with neighborhood and market data that we've collected, we can usually make you an offer on the spot. If we come to an agreement on a price and terms, we will draw up a contract that is then taken to our title company.  Our title company prepares for the closing.  You receive your money for the house at the closing and you're done! We use Couthino Law which is located in Taunton, MA for all of our title work. They will draw up all of the necessary documentation and contracts and then schedule a closing. This process usually takes approximately 2 weeks, however if the situation is urgent we can get it all put together and completed on a ""rush"" basis in as little as 7-10 days. Every property and its owner's situations are different. We take into consideration the current market value of the property, the amount of equity, the cost of any repairs and/or renovations the property needs to be fully updated, and any external situations (i.e. Liens, Judgments, Back Taxes etc...) in order to determine what your Cash Offer should be. After you've filled out our owner information contact form or called us directly, I will do some quick analysis on the property and then give you a call to schedule an appointment that best suits you for us to come see your property in order to do a free no obligation property evaluation and give you a cash offer for your property as well as inform you of all of your other viable and potential options. Sometimes a  Cash Offer isn't always the best ""Solution"" for a homeowner. Sometimes it's all about the terms, Wilson Property Solutions makes sure to inform homeowners about all of the different ways that the deal could possibly be structured. This way the homeowner is not only informed of everything that is taking place but also is well informed of everything that could take place. We keep the ball in the court of the homeowner at all times. The homeowners are the masters of their own destiny. Wilson Property Solutions's policy is to inform first in foremost and then allow the homeowner to choose which deal structure best suits their individual needs. Every property and it's homeowners situations are all individual and unique, no two are truly alike.  Essentially there are only 3 possible outcomes that will take place if you sign a contract with Wilson Property Solutions to buy your property. They are as follows: 1. - Wilson Property Solutions will purchase your property with an all cash offer with the sole intention of updating, revamping, or rehabbing it ourselves then go about selling it once again as Wilson Property Solutions for a profit. Or we would be retaining ownership of your property and renting it out, thus turning it into a cash flowing investment. 2. - Wilson Property Solutions will purchase your property with the sole intention of assigning the contract to purchase your property to another private investor in our network for a wholesale fee; who would then in turn carry out the remainder of steps that I have already explained above in outcome number 1. 3. - Depending on the determining criteria of your given situation that we’ve previously covered we would instruct you on how to carry out either an owner financed lease option sale or a subject to an existing mortgage purchase agreement, to be carried out with either Wilson Property Solutions or another private investor that is within our network. Wilson Property Solutions makes the process of selling your house a breeze. You won't believe how easy it really is to have your house sold and cash in your hands. If you need to sell your property quick, but traditional means or strategies aren’t a good fit for you, whether if it’s because you don't want to deal with paying closing costs or commissions, making costly time consuming repairs, or dealing with droves of undecided buyers who may potentially back out of the deal at the last moment. Wilson Property Solutions could be your ""Solution"". Buying & fixing houses or other types of investment properties from folks just like you is something that we’re extremely passionate about. Wilson Property Solutions strongly believes in the importance of the continued development & area re-gentrification of our cities and towns. As always our Commonwealth must  face certain issues, and as always we must solve certain issues together. Together we need to find certain ""Solutions"". In order for property values to rise or even stay the same we need to provide a ""Solution"" for the amount of existing and future foreclosures. Our children deserve a long term answer to this crisis. At Wilson Property Solutions it has been our mission since even before our company’s official inception to continuously seek out and team up and/or partner with as vast and wide a variety of Real Estate Investors and other various professionals & related tradesmen in our industry as possible. We have done this in an effort to take advantage of what each other has learned along the way, the unique skill sets & tools provided by the different roles played in the real estate industry, and also our combined buying powers. It has also been and will continue to be as we grow our goal to provide the best service possible. We have built and will continue to build these relationships so we can better serve people like you who want to make the process of selling their home or investment property as simple, easy, approachable & painless as possible. Putting your property on the market and waiting weeks or even months for an interested buyer to come along can be very time consuming and nerve-wracking. Having to keep everything in immaculate condition so that you can constantly show your property to complete strangers that might not even have the ability to get a loan to buy your house can be very aggravating as well. Why put yourself through all of that? You've already found a ready and willing buyer here. Just give us a call and get an offer from a qualified buyer today.

(note: only people on a list can send messages to that list). So, when any rider learns of an issue during the commute, they can send an alert to their fellow travelers via a short note which describes what they are seeing. Clever Commute provides a forum for members of a â€œcommuting communityâ€ to notify and help each other (examples of the issues encountered include: equipment problems, police activity, and weather-related issues). It is more of an â€œalertingâ€ network rather than a â€œsocialâ€ one insomuch as we can go days without any messages being sent. We recognize that several of the transit providers already have alerting systems in placeâ€¦and Clever Commute does not try to replace that. Since 2006, we have expanded Clever Commute to include NJ Transit (all trains and several bus lines), Metro North, LIRR and several buses, ferries and light rail lines. It is also now fully â€œliveâ€ in Chicago & Boston. We are in various stages of deployment in Baltimore/DC, San Francisco, Portland, and Los Angeles.
