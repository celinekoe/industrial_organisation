It just got approved in the app store on Tuesday October 15th.  It’s a photo sharing app that enables users to share up to 10 photos at once. The thought process behind this was that you can't post more than a few photos to instagram without people getting annoyed at you for overposting.  With Slide users are essentially sharing a mini photo-album of up to 10 photos.   I’ve downloaded and tried a lot of “Slideshow” genre apps and they all try to attain the same result: Making a corny slideshow with sound or music. My app is not about making slide shows but about giving users the ability to share more of their experience with their friends. It’s more similar to posting photo albums than making a slide show. Slide is like an un-stitched Pic Stitch. Pic Stitch shows that people are craving the ability to share more than one photo at a time.     Features: -       Share up to 10 photos at once -       Share to Facebook and Twitter -       Generates unique Slide.co share URL when shared. Example: http://slide.co/p/MTU5fDEx -       Shared slideshow is mobile optimized. -       Ability to Like/Comment -       Popular page -       Hashtag Search/User search -       Facebook login -       Email registration   The current version 1.0 is the basic launch version. The 2.0 update is coming in two-three weeks and will make the app more complete. It will include things like: Photo cropping, ability to share to Instagram (as a slideshow video), 4Square API to check in places, a friend finder, recommended users, a Play/Pause button and loop feature to watch slides more easily, and more. Other refinements will include: ability to see another users follower/following list, ability to see list of who liked another users Slide,  notification for mentioning another user with @ symbol, and more. I want to add filters but that will be in the third update.","Apps, Content and Publishing, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Mobile, Music and Audio, Platforms, Software, Video",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Competitive systems cost between $800 - $1200 once navigation, mounts and interface hardware is included. In addition, service fees for these systems cost between $25 - $80 per month, per vehicle. Their in-cab ip67 industrial automotive tablets cost us $280 per unit to manufacture, and they expect their devices to retail for about $500, including navigation, cables and mounting hardware.    Their experience in building large data and communication systems has allowed us to design a service that will retail for about $15 per truck/per month including telecom fees. The lower service costs will give us a huge advantage in marketing to the smaller fleets. For example, by leasing the hardware, they can package the service fees and in-cab devices for $25 per truck with no upfront expenses. Overall they can claim 1/2 the Total Cost of Ownership when compared to comparable systems.    In the coming months they will add voice communication with vPBX integration, expense tracking, tax accounting and reporting, invoicing, accounts payable and accounts receivable. These will be extended by integrations with bill.com, quickbooks.com, Freshbooks, Xero, and Salesforce. These are industry firsts and they expect these features to play a major roll in adoption.    With the federal mandate and market characteristics, growth in the small fleet segment is expected to be well over 40%. The Scimitar plan will result in over 10% market penetration, which equates to about 300,000 subscriptions. When compared to recent acquisitions such as Omnitracs and XRS, this presents a possible value of over $300,000,000.","Hardware, Transportation",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
