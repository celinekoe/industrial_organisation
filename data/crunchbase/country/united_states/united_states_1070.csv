On this basis the system identifies and assesses the navigational situation (processing) and works out solutions (decisions) assuring safe navigation. For the system to function correctly it has to co-operate with standard equipment and systems installed on board (often used on leisure craft as well) such as: log, gyrocompas, ARPA (Automatic Radar Plotting Aids), GNSS (Global Navigational Satellite System), AIS (Automatic Identification System), ENC (Electronic Navigational Chart), sources of current navigational data.
