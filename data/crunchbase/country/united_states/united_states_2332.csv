ADispell research has revealed a novel mechanism that explains the onset of cognition loss and has discovered and validated lead compounds through in vivo experiments that interact favorably with the mechanism. The Company has performed successful laboratory work and has a scientific plan to make the technology attractive to the pharmaceutical industry for licensing.  ADispell operates a â€˜license in - add value â€“ license outâ€™ model that will result in a much faster investment payback than other pharmaceutical projects. This payback structure is based on licensing fees, milestone payments, and royalties from product sales. The business has completed technology licensing from Cornell University and expects substantial income during the next three years, which will produce an attractive, rapid investment return.  The experienced ADispell management team will take the promising technology, patented by Cornell, and advance it into a robust development of interest to one or more â€˜big pharmaâ€™ companies, by proceeding through the middle, formative stages of the pharmaceutical drug development process, and then executing a license with a pharma development company. The licensing company is expected to develop at least one blockbuster drug for memory loss by completing the clinical trial stage of this process. This three-year ADispell project will proceed with investor and grant support in the first year and then with funding from pharmaceutical partners during years two and three. At least one significant payment event is expected at the end of three years as a pharma company licenses the technology for clinical trial and final development for sale. ADispell expects to stay involved with the project in an ongoing development role during this time. Longer term income (after 7 to 9 years) includes royalty payments based on the blockbuster drug sales with development milestone payments occurring in the time between these two payment periods. Additional treatments for other neurological diseases are very possible, resulting in parallel revenue streams. The project offers other product (and license) opportunities such as biomarkers to identify the onset or presence of AD (another unmet need) as well as the possibility to produce more than one drug compound for AD and dementia disorders.","Biotechnology, Science and Engineering",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Mobility is expected. Securing this connectivity is the point! This is why we developed “Fluid security” — eM-Connect™. The entire eM-Connect™ ecosystem was designed and developed with you in mind. “User Experience” really matters! End users want what they know and know what they want. Sysadmins face layers upon layers of complex systems and tasks. Service provider margins are tight, complexity is really expensive. Developers need a flexible, secure connectivity “snap in” to simplify development. We've made secure connectivity accessible and simple, by focusing on the entire ecosystem’s User Experience. The eM-Connect™ platform addresses modern “Web Scale” systematic approaches to provide scalable, distributed, secure, and reliable connectivity services. To be clear “Web Scale” is not an acronym for “Big” It’s about dynamics, like: what to scale, when to scale and where to scale, based on: users, content, location, network stability and hardware status. Our “fluid security” methods let eM-Connect™ scale from SME to Google levels because of design. Our new system of flexible secure connectivity solutions provides, at runtime, encapsulation of existing internet and network transport protocols, allowing existing applications, resources and services to benefit from our secure connectivity methods without needing to redevelop these programs. Our “Snap-In” provides a simple secure development environment to bring new, disruptive products to market in the fields of financial services, healthcare, entertainment, IoT and many others.","Internet Services, Mobile, Privacy and Security, Software",2,"Craig Damon, Jimi Jorgensen",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Most students have some experience with drag and drop tools, but computer programming goes beyond the simplicity of drag and drop. With proper education in mind, The Programming Foundation focuses on education that is based on written instruction and concise documentation of examples and processes, as well as providing students with hands-on experience working together as a team by developing free and open source software projects to aid in global disaster relief and international humanitarian aid efforts for the public good. To that end, The Programming Foundation aims to meet several goals: The Programming Foundation commits to spreading awareness and education on computer programming and operating systems so that everyone is involved, and no one is left behind while the world advances. Our goal is for the widespread adoption of new and enhanced curriculum on computer programming and operating systems and for this knowledge to become mainstream in the general population. Without adequate instruction and training on advanced procedures in computer programming and operating systems, our children and the rest of the community will fall far behind technology. Automation is replacing jobs at a fast rate, and education behind that technology needs to ramp up to a similar speed. One way to stay on top of the continued advancements is to educate the general population and the younger generations on computer programming and operating systems. This education will produce a collaborative society that applies their collective knowledge toward technological innovations. We are already surrounded by devices that are smarter than the average human. This technology is becoming more widespread every day, and our lack of proper education on the subject leaves many behind on how it works. To keep everyone on the same level and to move society at the same speed as technology advances, we need to implement far-reaching educational systems to teach and learn how these technologies work. Together, we need to improve on our current educational processes and find better solutions. The Programming Foundation is dedicated to improving the available solutions so that we can make computer programming and operating systems education mainstream. We are committed to open-source and plan on developing and involving our volunteers in building industry standard technologies and applications that solve real-world problems and make the world a better place. Our objective is to maintain our goal of continuous technological developments and to encourage every citizen to learn more about computer programming and operating systems so that together, we are a smarter population.","Community and Lifestyle, Education, Hardware, Information Technology, Social Impact, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
