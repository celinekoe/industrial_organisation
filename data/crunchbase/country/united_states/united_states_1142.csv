For the past two decades, Robin’s built unprecedented strategic partnerships between the entertainment world and startups, fueling growth and mainstream success for tech companies. Starting the first new media division in the entertainment industry in 1993, Robin’s concepts created music and tech history for the biggest bands, artists and celebrities in the world. She created one of the first websites on the Internet, for a band which garnered global press coverage and won design awards. In 1997, she sold the music industry’s first digital single, which the Wall Street Journal called “a turning point for an industry.” Her digital strategy for Radiohead included streaming an album online for the first time. Global media coverage credited this as the reason that the band’s album debuted at number one, which helped shift the industry’s fear of sharing music online. At Warner Bros. Records, Robin built the music industry’s first mobile, digital music and merchandising divisions which generated hundreds of millions in revenue to the label. She worked with Apple to launch iTunes and discovered and partnered with YouTube, marking the entertainment industry’s first partnership with the online video platform. Robin’s projects have been featured in The Wall St. Journal, New York Times, CNN, Bloomberg, Time, Wired, Fortune, LA Times, Tech Crunch, Mashable, People and US Weekly.
