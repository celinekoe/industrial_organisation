AI-Powered Targeting Preflect deploys your ads to Google, TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and Google, using AI to more profitably find new shoppers everywhere they spend their time. 2. Optimize to Sell More Preflect connects to Shopify and major ad networks, enabling you to optimize landing pages to earn more sales, and dynamically allocate budget in real-time. 3. Track iOS Shoppers We use third-party data and a proprietary media mix model to accurately track more sales in this iOS 14.5+ era, so you can automatically optimize targeting with better data, and receive clear recommendations on your ads. Ad agencies manually spend hours setting up and running your ads, then slowly try to optimize them with Facebook's poor data. Preflect makes them obsolete.
