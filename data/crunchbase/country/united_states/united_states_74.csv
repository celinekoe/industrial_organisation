A reduction in fees would be meaningless if your home did not achieve its maximum value on the market. The good news for CataList Home's clients is they not only save thousands of dollars in fees, but yield higher prices and almost identical marketing times than other homes sold in the market. Data from hundreds of CataList sales in Los Angeles and Orange County prove that they achieve the highest sold price to listing price The truth is, it does not cost any real estate agent more than 3% to sell a home. Fees in excess of 3% represent an excessive charge to the home seller for the use of a real estate agent involved in an old, inefficient and costly system. Instead, you should be asking: ""How can Realtors continue to charge five and six percent commissions (typically eliminating 20-25% of homeowner equity) when the average home is sold in less than 30 days?"" When you consider the fact that home prices have virtually doubled in the last five years, how can Realtors keep the commission percentage the same and essentially double their fee? Your conventional agent is asking you for a 100% pay raise in 5 years, and he wants you to pay for it. A 3% commission in 2006 is the same dollar cost as 6% just five years ago when you factor in home appreciation. This is how they offer all the essential service for 3%.",Real Estate,,,1-10,3,Late Stage Venture,8500000,USD,8500000,8500000,USD,8500000,"WestRiver Group, The Angels' Forum, The Halo Fund",,3,,Private,,,,,,

When co-founder Ivana Lo Stimolo had finished reading Anne Fogarty’s Wife Dressing, The Fine Art of Being a Well Dressed Wife she couldn’t help but feel a special connection to Anne. While certain parts of the book have a vintage flair about them most of the advice dished out is still very much valid today. Anne’s opinionated views of fashion, attention to detail and use of quality materials resonated greatly with the Milan native.  After a few discussions about the book and Anne’s design career with her partner Greg Halvorsen it wasn’t long before he had scooped up the rights to the Fogerty label. By September of 2013 Anne Fogarty, Inc was once again a registered corporation in New York with it’s headquarters less than a mile away from Anne’s original atelier. By January the company had both a design team and a production agreement in place.  The new Anne Fogarty collection will not follow the traditional fashion calendar but will be offered in 6 mini capsule collections over the year; one every two months. The reason for this is it allows more flexibility to meet changing consumer patterns and creates a certain level of urgency: buy now or you will not find it later. It also provide the opportunity to introduce more unique collections, such as a holiday dresses in November or summer dresses in July.  The mini collections will be sold on line via proprietary editorial content, such as their own magazine. The fact that Anne Fogarty was relevant and designed for over three decades provides a wealth of material for publishing and marketing purposes. The online store will be incorporated into the published material instead of a traditional online store format. To compliment the online sales the company will look for a brick and mortar partner, such as a department store or national apparel chain. The partnership could be exclusive so as to provide a seamless experience for the customer between online and in-store shopping.","Clothing and Apparel, Commerce and Shopping, Community and Lifestyle, Design",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
