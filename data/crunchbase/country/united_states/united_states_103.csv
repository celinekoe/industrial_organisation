Our work is powered by our belief that all children are capable of learning and thriving, and that every individual, institution and sector shares the responsibility to help young people succeed.  We are the nation’s largest partnership of our kind, bringing together hundreds of national nonprofits, businesses, communities, educators and ordinary citizens behind the idea of making the promise of America accessible to all young people.  Far too many young people are growing up without the support they need to succeed in school and life. More than 20 percent of high school students do not graduate on time. Moreover, the most recent estimate is that 5.8 million young people between age 16 and 24 are neither in school nor employed. This lack of opportunity for young people is morally untenable, economically unsustainable, and fundamentally inconsistent with our values and aspirations as a nation.  We frame our work around Five Promises that we believe must be made and kept to every young American – caring adults, safe places, a healthy start, an effective education, and opportunities to serve. With the supportive environment of these promises at work for young Americans, we believe we can reach a more tangible goal: a 90 percent graduation rate by 2020. Our GradNation campaign is focused on putting this critical milestone – and therefore a shot at the American Dream – within reach for young Americans.  At our founding in 1997, we set forth Five Promises that create the essential conditions for all young people to have a real chance of success. Research shows that young people who experience at least four of the promises are far more likely to succeed academically, socially, economically and civically. That’s why, our Alliance works to keep the Five Promises to as many young people as possible.","Education, Other, Social Impact",1,Colin Powell,51-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Torstenson. It started out as a small manufacturer of hand-held staplers and related fasteners on the north side of Chicago. Products were sold under the Duo-Fast brand name. The company grew rapidly during World War II when it was awarded substantial government contracts for Duo-Fast staples, hand tackers and hammer tackers. The market's acceptance of automatic stapling products quickly increased within various industrial markets. After the war, the company further established itself in the industrial staple industry by expanding its product line to meet the needs of new applications, particularly those in the furniture and woodworking industries. In 1947, Fastener Corporation, in collaboration with a major automobile manufacturer, developed the world's first pneumatic stapler. Not only did this stapling tool eliminate the production bottleneck in the carmaker's upholstery trim shop, but it also led the way for new generations of air-driven staplers that played a major role in the economic boom of the late 1940s through the 1950s. New markets opened up for Fastener Corporation in 1964 when the company introduced its first pneumatic strip nailer (CN-135). Within the next five years the company introduced additional strip and coil nailers, all of which led to a new period of growth and development as Duo-Fast pneumatics quickly gained the wide-spread acceptance of homebuilders and manufacturers alike. The Duo-Fast brand name became so well recognized that it was adopted as the corporate name. In 1974, Fastener Corporation officially became Duo-Fast Corporation. In 1999, Duo-Fast Corporation was acquired by Illinois Tool Works, Inc., a diversified manufacturer of engineered components and systems, including many specifically for the construction market. Today, Duo-Fast Construction draws on the global resources of its parent company to provide innovative tools and fasteners to residential construction professionals!","Consumer Electronics, Hardware, Manufacturing, Real Estate",1,Henry A.
