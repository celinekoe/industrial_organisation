The foundation was founded in 2022 by Jennifer Stanich Banmiller and is headquartered in the SF Bay Area. Our goal is to help the women and their children/families who have been left as collateral damage to big profits by the drug and product companies by helping raise money for care, treatment and ideally building prototype Life centers in different parts of the country for them to physically get treatment at a physical or mental or wellness level.  History For 30 years, the drug and product industry has run amok over everyday citizens who trust the drugs they are taking and the products put in there body. But the trust is NOT reciprocated because big pharma/product companies will do whatever they need to to make billions, even if it means making injured or killing the most vulnerable of our society -women and children-who never complain and are traditionally silent victims. Litigation rarely helps them and there is no other avenue.[2] In 2019- Jennifer Stanich Banmiller and Alicia Mundy wrote the book- Crystal mesh.- How Addiction to money turned drug makers ,the FDA and doctors into street dealers to help women who had been brutally injured by a piece of plastic mesh put inside them without ever being tested in one live women feel vindicated, tell the story and hopefully get these women help and a voice. For women it was the most barbaric product ever to be mass sold and implanted in them. For doctors and lawyers it was a huge pay day. The atrocities of this and other products like Opiods and vaping have left countless women and their children/families dead, permanently disabled or just existing in great pain with no help for them medically or psychologically. That’s why the Jennifer Stanich Banmiller.org was formed. As CEO of Wingtip Communications Inc and Hive80 LLC she has been on the forefront of watching the most vulnerable of our society get unfair treatment and seeing friends, colleagues, strangers hope for help that will never come- not from health care, not from congress, not from the guilty parties themselves because they pillage peoples lives and move on to another big money maker. The Jennifer Stanich Banmiller movement will help create a network of physicians and health professionals who they can talk to and find referrals, medical help and or monetary help as money gets raised to lead a more productive life. Our goal is also to build physical Life centers for these women and there children/families where they can go free of charge to get the help they need to led a more healthy life whether that be sleep, counseling, treatment, meditation, whatever they need to be a productive part of society again and live again as much as possible.",Health Care,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
