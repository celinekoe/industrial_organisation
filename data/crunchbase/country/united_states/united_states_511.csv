We do so via a marketplace where pilots of light aircraft with extra seats can list their flights and people going to the same places can arrange to fly with them in exchange for sharing the costs.  Since passengers pay only their share of actual costs,, they gain a level of mobility and convenience previously reserved for the very few, at a tiny fraction of traditional private air. Ride-sharing is popular among pilots but in practice quite difficult to do due to the complexity of FAA rules on cost-sharing; as a result most seats go unfilled today.

Chicago, IL October  22, 2014 — Optimus Advantage LLC today announced it has been awarded by SAP $20,000 in Amazon Web Services(AWS) credits to further develop the Optimus Advantage™ Marketplace software solution for online retailers.  The Optimus Advantage Marketplace operates on the SAP HANA® platform and is accessible on the Amazon Web Services global network.   Amazon Web Services is a collection of remote computing services that comprise the AWS Cloud computing platform, offered over the Internet by Amazon.com. AWS hosts SAP HANA on the AWS Cloud, and SAP has certified SAP HANA for production use on the AWS Cloud. Customers can use Amazon Web Services to access SAP HANA-based applications.  SAP HANA is offered by SAP SE (NYSE: SAP), a world-leading provider of enterprise software and services. SAP HANA combines database, data processing, and application platform capabilities in-memory. The platform provides libraries for predictive, planning, text processing, spatial, and business analytics. By providing advanced capabilities, such as predictive text analytics, spatial processing and data virtualization on the same architecture, it further simplifies application development and processing across big-data sources and structures. This makes SAP HANA a highly suitable platform for building and deploying next-generation, real-time applications and analytics. Optimus Advantage LLC joined the SAP® Startup Focus program to leverage the power of SAP HANA for online retail customers to enable  them to instantaneously negotiate item price in real time and receive an iPON™ .  An iPON is an electronic retailer store credit given to the customer that can be applied towards a future online or in-store purchase.  The Optimus Advantage™ Marketplace engages customers with a retailer store credit. The iPON™ is stored in SAP HANA database and can be accessed on the customer’s smartphone or computer and applied towards the retailer item purchase price or traded with other customers in the Optimus Advantage Marketplace Network.  Now, retailers can offer a reliable method to engage their customers through negotiation, and distribute their iPON™ store credits to customers.  The Amazon.com AWS-Activate credit will enable us to build out the Optimus Advantage Marketplace on the SAP HANA platform to immediately process millions of negotiations in real time and distribute  iPON™ retailer store credits for immediate use by customers.

The idea for Zoodles was born while Mark watched his 4-year-old daughter, Abbie, struggle while using the computer. He wondered why kids were constantly trying to adapt to computers rather than having the computers adapt to them. After talking with dozens of other parents, it became clear that they were all equally frustrated with the experiences their children were having online. While parents universally believed that the computer could help their kids learn, they just didn't have the time or resources to scour the web and find any of this fun, educational content themselves. Additionally, parents wanted more say over what their children were doing online. Without trusted content, they really didn't want to open up the whole, sometimes scary, web to their young kids. Mark decided it was time to build a safe, fun, and educational online experience for kids that also gave parents the information and control they wanted. After discussing the idea with his friend, Rich, they decided to form a company to build Zoodles. â€¨ Since then, the team has grown to include incredibly talented engineers, educational experts, and creative designers who understand how to build simple interfaces for kids. The team is excited to be working on a product that can change how children learn while giving parents an active role in the experience.
