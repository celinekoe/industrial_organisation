(RAIN) is a Real Estate Investment Company formed for the acquisition and revitalization/renovation of approximately 18,000 distressed single and multifamily residential dwellings in the Indianapolis Metropolitan market. RAIN only purchases properties that fall within a 65-80% ARV (after rehab value) or 50-70% LTV. Our focus is concentrated on homes selling at wholesale or below prices from $5,000 to $100,000. RAIN's experience shows that the average rehab requirement is approximately $12,000 to $20,000. These numbers are derived from various completed projects. RAIN is able to rehab inexpensively due to vendor relationships to keep the costs down, uniformity of the material & labor process, ie- uniform paint, carpet, hardware,and countertops in all properties, etc., and reasonable labor expenses. These rehabbed properties will then be sold to an end buyer via realtor marketing, MLS, and signage. If a particular property is not selling within 60 to 90 'days on market' then it will be rented out to qualified renters on an RTO agreement and then sold at fair market value. RAIN projects that 3 years will be an average timeframe to pay for the renovation and to achieve an acceptable ROI based on the ARV of that particular home. RAIN will leave its mark in the Indianapolis market by posturing itself as a catalyst in bringing back many homes to habitable and family safe conditions. This idea directly corresponds with the tag line of RAIN, ""We do for houses what raindrops do for nature."" RAIN brings to the table a stellar infrastructure of well seasoned skilled tradesmen who understand the expectations of vocational excellence. RAIN's strongest suit is the leadership experience spawned from restoring storm battered homes on the Mississippi Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina.  RAIN has a system in place to move forward at a creative and consistent pace to reach our projected goals of restoring 500 homes by the year 2016.",Real Estate,,,11-50,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Online ads were the answer to adapting to modernization in the past, but funding is drying out. Advertising revenue in the United States has drastically fallen from $65 billion to $19 billion between 2000 to 2016. Traditional media publishers are obligated to look into Voucher Code White Label partnerships to keep up with today's changing industry. It is common for many traditional media companies to adapt slowly to new digital media advantages. The slower companies adapt to modern technological advances, the more outdated their advertising strategies become, and the more gradual their market moves. To increase their advertising speed, as well as their revenue stream, publishers have to continue to find creative new ways to utilize what options prove potentially as more profitable. Voucher Code White Label partnerships are the modern answer. Publishers can diversify their revenue with little risk through partnering with Voucher websites. Another benefit publishers experience, when working with Voucher Companies and White Label Coupon sites, is the opportunity they provide for their company to receive full sales funnel optimization. The companies who want to survive and thrive in the dying traditional media industry must decide to adopt the modern trend of publishers partnering with Voucher Code White Label solutions.","Advertising, Content and Publishing, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Sales and Marketing",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Secondly, this company would also develop the relative low cost and ground based 3D laser scan equipment for various applications.  LiDAR stands for “Light Detection and ranging”, and it is a newly developed three dimensional (3D) digital data capturing technology. In practice, LiDAR equipment uses invisible laser beam to scan the geographic features on the earth’s surface.  The equipment records the laser pulse reflections at very detailed sample location of a geographic object. It forms a digital point cloud in the computer database to depict the real world features such as buildings, bridges, and trees. Each of the points has its own real world 3D coordinates (x, y, z).  The current discrepancy of the LiDAR 3D data capture and design industry is:  1.        Hardware equipment of field data collection is very expensive. The major reason of this situation is that only about four companies worldwide manufacture the LiDAR survey or data collection equipment. Their major focus is to improve the accuracy and the precision of the surveying data. The owner ability of ground and tripod based LiDAR equipment worldwide is largely sacrificed.  2.        The LiDAR 3D data collection and design industry lacks efficient and widely applied point cloud data processing software. Many large digital point cloud datasets were collected. However, very few accurate digital 3D data model of houses, buildings, and bridges were extracted and generated. Simply there is no effective software to classify the features hidden in the point cloud and extract them to build scaled 3D models to the real world.

Their mission is to provide monetary donations to a broad range of vetted charities through profits made from purchasing gold.  	Essentially, Gold Cures aims to purchase diamonds, gold, and other precious metals from their customers. In addition to the amount paid to the customer, an additional ten percent is donated to a partner charity selected by their customer. Here's how it works: A customer has some 14k gold they want to sell. They print out a shipping label from the Gold Cures website and ship the gold. When it is received, the gold is weighed. In this case it turns out to be 22 grams. The customer is paid a higher than industry standard amount for their gold. In this case it is $371.19. The company then makes a donation of ten percent of that amount, $37.19 to whichever charity the customer selected via their website. Charities such as the American Red Cross, Wounded Warrior Project, Unicef, Make-A-Wish, the ASPCA, Toys for Tots, and many more are represented. 	The company is concerned with hunger, poverty, medical, sanitary and living conditions of people from around the world.

If you are contemplating marriage and want to protect your assets, you may want a premarital agreement.  Premarital agreements can help ensure that your assets remain your own, limit spousal support obligations in the case of divorce, protect your assets from the debts of your spouse, and make provision for the payment of household expenses and the sharing of income during marriage.  Similarly, if you are already married and want to designate ownership of assets in a particular manner, a post nuptial agreement can help you achieve that goal.","Financial Services, Professional Services",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
