A Local is someone from that city who will provide concierge-like services. Each Local can specialize in an aspect of the city and may already have or can create a large network in that area, for example: Culinary, landmarks/history, fitness/health, parties, & others; the user can then choose the type of Local they want.  When starting the app for the first time, a registration screen with two options (Local | Traveler) will appear. If an individual chooses to be a Local, we will run a background check on them, providing an increased level of security and peace of mind to users seeking exotic experiences. After each booking, the Local would receive a 0-5 star rating. The idea is that better Locals get more opportunities and bookings. All users (Travelers and Locals) can post images/videos/reels of the experience and attract exponentially more individuals. Our app gives communities a chance at gentrification: otherwise, unknown regions can attract global attention through our feed features and international marketing. We are currently initiating data collection trials in small municipalities in the north of Brazil to prove this point. Further on, with more tourists visiting smaller communities, the region's economy also gets positively affected, improving the quality of life of thousands and potentially millions.  We solve not one but various problems present in the Tourism and Concierge industries. With our app, it is no longer dangerous, pricey, disconnected, and time-consuming to properly explore a city the way you would like to. It can now be done with a simple click. And along with solving these impediments, we also give people independence, quality, and a chance to be seen.
