It reduces the cost of building a structure by minimizing the man-hours needed to manufacture it and also increases the speed at which the house can be put on the market, lowering the financing cost by allowing it to turn a profit for the builder more quickly. The process should also be much safer for construction workers than traditional building techniques, which would lower the cost of insurance for building companies. Contour Crafting technology has great potential for automating the construction of whole structures as well as sub-components. Using this process, a single house or a colony of houses, each with possibly a different design, may be automatically constructed in a single run, embedded in each house all the conduits for electrical, plumbing, and air-conditioning. The potential applications of this technology are far reaching including but not limited to applications in emergency, low-income, and commercial housing.

You can find gift cards and e-gift cards for these merchants everywhere.  Local merchants are nowhere to be found.  As the retailing landscape evolves, it is important for small local merchants to find new distribution channels to survive.   GiftVolo mission is to help local merchants survive and thrive by leveling the playing field.  We are providing opportunities for local merchants to showcase their service menus and niche products on GiftVolo so that anyone living anywhere in the US (eventually globally)  can gift their products in 3 simple clicks.  Currently, if I wish to gift a dance class to a friend of my daughter's from a local dance school, I must drive to the merchant and buy a hand written gift voucher and then hand it to my friend.  However, this limits the local merchants distribution to 25 miles radius around them and also is highly inconvenient for me as a  consumer.","Commerce and Shopping, Other, Sales and Marketing",1,Shelly Gupta,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
