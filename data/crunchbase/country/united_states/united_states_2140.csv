Robocist - Road Triage,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/robocist,"Autonomous Vehicles, GovTech, Image Recognition, Infrastructure, Internet of Things, Mapping Services, Public Transportation, Transportation","Raleigh, North Carolina, United States","Road Triage is a comprehensive, objective roadway assessment system that uses AI to provide quarterly pavement and lane line condition data.","592,999","Research Triangle, East Coast, Southern US",,Active,2015-01-03,day,,,,,For Profit,https://www.Robocist.com,"Road Triage is a comprehensive, objective roadway assessment system that provides regular updates on pavement and lane line conditions. Users receive more complete and consistent data than current manually collected road assessment methods at a lower cost. It is also significantly less expense than LIDAR-based approaches. Using fleet-sourced data collection from windshield mounted devices, Road Triage delivers results that are current, comprehensive, and consistent – without the drawbacks of human subjectivity. Workers avoid hazardous situations while collecting data. In addition to improving the allocation of maintenance resources, the resulting data supports root cause analysis, and predictive asset decay studies. Data Rich:  Road Triage provides actionable data with road segment scores for lane lines and pavement distress such as potholes, patches, multiple crack types, and pavement edge issues. These are color-coded, assessed/scored, and geo-tagged. Ride quality is also analyzed identifying bumps, dips/lifts, and roughness. Images are provided for identified issues. This level of detail provides a better understanding of road conditions without having to visit in person. Online management reports include quantified data visualization, maps, and exportable datasets for use in popular spreadsheet and GIS software.  High Quality:  The value of data depends on its quality. Road Triage’s AI algorithms consistently and accurately identify and assess pavement distress issues and lane lines. When compared to manual data collection and assessment methodology, Road Triage removes human subjectivity - resulting in more consistent and accurate results. Furthermore, the AI models are regularly updated and retrained. A team of specialists combs through new data enabling the AI models to learn from new experiences.  Reduced Costs and Safety:  High-quality road data at a low price is the cornerstone of Road Triage. The current process requires expensive LIDAR equipment and/or dedicated field staff to drive and walk the roads. This approach is dangerous for the workers walking unprotected on active roadways. Using Road Triage, road data are collected while fleets drive their typical routes, with no additional effort required for most roads. For roads not covered by typical fleet operations, data can be collected by simply driving them. There is no need to exit the vehicle and manually evaluate the roads. The reduced data collection and processing effort translates into a lower cost with increased data quality and frequency. Additionally, reconstructing roads costs approximately four times more than resurfacing them. Road Triage can provide asset conditions of the entire road network supporting early intervention thus reducing long-term costs and improving roadway safety.  USDOT Road to Zero:  Road Triage supports the vision and goals of the USDOT Road to Zero initiative – a collaborative effort among the NHTSA, FHWA, FMCSA, NSC, and state DOTs with the goal of ending fatalities on the nation’s roads. According to the USDOT, the lack of adequate roadway safety features and poor roadway condition are likely a significant contributing factor to motor vehicle accidents. The timely identification and assessment of poor roadway markings and pavement distress from Road Triage can be instrumental to keeping roadways in optimal operational condition.  Robocist works with state and local transportation organizations, adding value to their transportation networks by providing quantifiable access to current, relevant roadway data, asset conditions, and the associated trends that support efficient asset management.","Data and Analytics, Government and Military, Information Technology, Internet Services, Navigation and Mapping, Other, Software, Transportation",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
