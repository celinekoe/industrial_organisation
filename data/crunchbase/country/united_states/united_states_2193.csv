Few investment groups specialize in investing $50k to $2 million in early-stage companies and even fewer bring a broad value-add network to support entrepreneurs. The Seraph Investor Network was founded with the vision of providing capital and support  in an expedient and efficient manner without geographic prejudice. Our Investor Network reaches 91+ cities and spans three continents. The reach provides valuable expertise to entrepreneurs and investors. Seraph Group is comprised of a diverse group of business leaders, entrepreneurs, and technology leaders across wide array of different industries. By leveraging this expertise, Seraph Group is able to evaluate and invest in venture scalable opportunities across most industries. Investments range from $50K to $1.5 million and can participate along any financing stage of the company. While Seraph Group is comprised solely of angel investors, the investment process mimics a traditional venture capital firm where there is a fund managed by a small investment team. This pool of smart capital brings singular access to a prestigious group of individuals that are all invested in an entrepreneur's business and its success. In today' market, companies have proven that only a relatively small amount of capital infusion, under $1 million, is enough to build a venture scalable business. However, most entrepreneurs will attest, that raising $500K to $1.5 million, is the hardest amount of capital to raise because it is too small for traditional venture firms. Seraph Group's focus is to fill this unmet need in the market for professional, smart capital. The primary investment criteria for companies raising money is for it to be a venture-scalable business and not a life-style business. Seraph Group will consider investing in any round of financing and has often invested alongside later-stage venture firms.","Financial Services, Lending and Investments",1,Tuff Yen,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Many people and businesses have had no choice when it came to purchasing energy to fuel their businesses. All they could do. was take the power from the provider in their area, and the high rates that came with it. Now, because of deregulation, the country is experiencing a revolution in the electrical transmission industry.    Newer companies providing energy, both electricity and natural gas, have entered the market. This has caused a shift in the positions of power within the industry and enabled businesses to accept the best value from theses new alternative energy suppliers.    Electricity and natural gas are commodities. Their prices change daily with the market. This makes it challenging for most businesses, without professional energy procurement managers, to obtain price comparisons from a variety of suppliers. Prices must be compared on exactly the same day in order to get the best deal. In addition, the terms of the particular contract offered by the supplier influences the price that is quoted. A professional energy consultant and broker, provides a valuable service to businesses, because they work with a large number of suppliers and can compile the prices, terms and conditions, from sundry suppliers and offer the best solution to the client when purchasing energy for their enterprise.","Energy, Natural Resources, Other, Sustainability",1,Andrew Shoemaker,1-10,1,,480000,USD,480000,480000,USD,480000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

It’s a unique mashup featuring adventurous female characters and rich illustrated details that inspire girls and boys alike to build and imagine. In the past, toy companies designed their construction toys almost exclusively for boys.

They can approach toy design in a more thoughtful way, and doing so is important. Building toys develop important spatial reasoning, problem solving, and design skills that are prerequisites to succeed in fields of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM).
