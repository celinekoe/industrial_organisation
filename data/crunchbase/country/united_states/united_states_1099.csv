The foundersâ€™ detailed knowledge and understanding of carrier billing was formed from many years spent selling and integrating carrier services. In 2005, this knowledge base became Total Telecom Consulting. In all their years working on the carrier sales side of the industry, the founders identified a clear need in the marketplace for consulting designed to help fiscal managers within organizations streamline and understand the telecom & Tech line items of their P&L. Recent trends show that clients need to reduce budgets in order to justify needed projects or purchases. Discovering that most CFO's and Controllers responsible for managing organizational expense rarely possess the amount of time or skill set necessary to track down all the anomalies characteristic of telecom billing. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In today's business climate all businesses have some sort of pain when it comes to telecom services, and Total Telecom Consulting business model truly addresses these pains. After many years of representing specific products to prospects it was realized that this approach was totally incorrect. How can you expect to  truly help customers when you are carrying commitments to specific vendors with specific products? Every customer has a very unique situation and your business model must adapt and change to address each clients unique needs and goals on a continuous basis.  Total Telecom Consulting is now positioned as a non exclusive partner to every major carrier and vendor in the marketplace both nationally and internationally, and our firm carries no revenue commitments with these carriers or vendors as many telecom agencies do. This provides a totally unbiased pool of resources to benefit customers with customized solutions and services. I hope that provides you with a little insight as to how Total Telecom Consulting differs from the typical telecom agency. Total Telecom Consulting handles all bid processes, procurement, and if needed project and services management on the clients behalf. We eliminate the need to meet with multiple sales people, without taking away the confidence that you've looked at all the options. Our services provide an expert single point of contact for all telecom and technology related processes and projects.  There are no scenarios where we try to make a product work (square peg round hole) to fit a customers need. Total Telecom Consulting does however target the customers business processes, needs, and from there the correct product sets are discovered that will provide and address needs thus improving business processes. Total Telecom also handles many private bid processes for contractors and corporate relocation specialists who have telecom cabling/fiber and or infrastructure built into specific projects, this provides them with expert insight and a single point of contact for RFP's, project management, and forward management.  Other focuses of Total Telecom Consulting business model are business continuity, disaster / telecom recovery, and Total Telecom Expense Managementâ„¢. These services are truly setting a standard of excellence leaving clients much less vulnerable to outages and lost revenues due to outages or data loss. The Total Telecom Expense Managementâ„¢ portion shelters the customer from incorrect billings and provides prompt recovery of incorrect billings. Most organizations that are driven to being progressive and value Unbiased insight into these pains find tremendous value, especially in instances where they cannot afford or are not getting results needed with an internal technology staff member*. In regard to Total Telecom Expense Managementâ„¢ we have provided a few snippets from our website that  provides insight into how the industry has progressed and why there is such an overwhelming demand for these services.","Hardware, Information Technology, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Messaging and Telecommunications, Mobile, Music and Audio, Professional Services",,,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Due to the nature of many other autoimmune conditions, it is highly likely that Equon's antibodies will be able to treat other conditions, expanding the market opportunities.    The estimated market size for those that suffer from Late Phase Asthmatic Response is 2.3 million people and there is currently no competition in the marketplace for a preventative solution such as the one Equon is proposing. Today individuals who suffer from this type of response need to seek immediate medical attention to restore the ability to breathe. When the antibodies are taken by the patient on a monthly basis, it will prevent the late phase asthmatic response from happening within the body. The target is to have FDA approval by 2019 and achieve a 25% penetration rate by 2021 with an annual sales target of $673 M.    Rheumatoid Arthritis impacts an estimate of 1.5 million people. There is substantial competition in the space including drugs such as Humira. However, most of the drugs offered to treat patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis have significant side effects including but not limited to the development of cancer and in severe cases death. Equon’s antibodies will be able to provide a much safer solution with the expectation of minimal side effects. Equon forecasts FDA approval by year end 2020 and will achieve a 25% penetration rate into the market by 2023 with an annual sales estimate of $661 M.     The antibody development will be following a specific series of development of which would be incredibly challenging for competitors to replicate. Some of the keys areas are the human fusion partners, a series of proteins along with the time necessary to gain FDA approval. It is for these reasons Equon will not be submitting a patent and will be keeping this process a trade secret.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
