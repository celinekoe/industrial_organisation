Docker containers were being used to host and isolate server processes invoked on behalf of our users and often running their code. The project was started by building the Docker image dynamically whenever a new host node spun up. The image was monolithic. It was too large, took too long to build, and was hard to manage conflicts. It was everything that Docker wasn't supposed to be. When it was decided to split it up into pre-built images and host them somewhere, it was noticed that there wasn't a good place to host images securely. Determined to scratch the itch, Quay.io was built, and officially launched it as an aside in a presentation to the Docker New York City Meetup on October 2nd, 2013. After launch, customers demanded that Quay.io become the main focus. They rely on the company to make sure they can store and distribute their Docker images.
