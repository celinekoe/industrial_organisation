It'll be the foundation that holds us together as we look to accomplish huge goals in the years to come. The concept of living in ""professional"" and ""personal"" silos has always been a foreign concept and even beyond evo, it seems to be more an idea rather than reality. The fact is what you do for work is very personal. It's where you spend many of your waking hours and the relationships with those you work with day in, day out are far too important to be cordoned off from personal life. Over the years, friends, families, traveling and mountain partners, dinner eating and beer drinking buddies, and motorcycle gangs have all formed at evo. We've drawn near when a close friend has been faced with a challenging time and have celebrated together when our once roommates-turned office mates-turned responsible parents have started cranking out little ones. When talking about a strained relationship that I was trying to navigate a couple years back, a wise friend once told me, ""Life is too short and it's also too long."" Life is too short but when you think about it, it can feel too long when you're not working with people that you love and respect and who love and respect you. This October we passed another major milestone in the company's history having opened our new flagship store, setting the stage for many to come.

In order to better understand how these are useful, you'll have to know a bit about DNA itself.  DNA is ""the blueprint for life"" and encodes instructions for all of life's processes. DNA is a complex long thin molecule (strand) that is made from 4 possible building blocks called ""bases"". These bases are called Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine and Thymine, and the precise order of these bases is a code for information. In living organisms, DNA strands can be millions of bases long and therefore contain huge amounts of information. This complexity is responsible for the vast complexity and diversity of life on earth.  The way that one strand of DNA specifically binds a second strand of DNA allows scientists to use short DNA strands (oligos) as research tools. A short synthetic piece of DNA (usually around 20 bases long) can be used to bind or find its matching sequence even in a complex mixture of millions of unrelated pieces of DNA. It is this unique fact that allows researchers to decode and study the genetic makeup of any living organism.  Using new oligo-based technologies, a revolution is underway where they are beginning to catalog the complete genetic makeup of hundreds of living things, ranging from bacteria to humans. The human genome alone contains over 3 billion bases of DNA, so projects of this kind tend to be very complex and often take years to complete.  Scientists often start the research knowing the DNA sequence for the organism that they are interested in studying. Given a known DNA sequence, they can easily design a short oligo that can be used to perform a variety of tasks. It is this short single-stranded DNA that the researcher orders from IDT. Living systems don't discriminate DNA that is synthesized chemically from DNA taken directly from an organism, allowing researchers to use IDT's custom made oligonucleotides as if they had existed naturally.  IDT manufactures the oligo using chemical DNA synthesis machines designed and built in-house. They've refined the process to the point where they can receive an order as late as 1:00pm and have the desired oligo in the researcher's hands the next morning. Their customers range from small university labs of only a few scientists to global pharmaceutical companies, and everything in between.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",1,Joseph Walder,501-1000,1,M&A,,USD,,,USD,,Summit Partners,,1,4,Private,,,,,,

Children are guided through visual puzzles and games designed to help them see the big ideas behind math, rather than memorize facts. Virtual toy building bricks take the place of traditional manipulatives, with studs on the surface representing numeric value. The platform adjusts to each child's level and comes with a suite of analytics that track learning outcomes. Off computer hands-on projects further extend learning.  The MathBRIX mission is to create new learning technologies that will make a significant social and economic impact over time. For the US to remain a world economic leader, all children must be able to think mathematically and problem-solve. Children behind in kindergarten, often stay behind through the remaining school years. Only 40% of U.S. fourth grade students are deemed proficient on national math assessments. Early intervention is key. The visual strategies are derived from the federally-funded Comprehensive School Mathematics Program. Twenty years of research found CSMP students had greater ability to solve novel math problems. CSMP was effective with the gifted as well as the learning challenged. MathBRIX testing with over 500 students confirms high student engagement, feasibility, promise of learning. A larger test is underway in 34 districts nation-wide.
