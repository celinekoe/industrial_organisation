Fumfie.com's mission statement is to provide an online home shopping emporium that caters to the retail market at wholesale price points; which has catapulted our company's growth, and made us a leader in home shopping e-tailing.

It takes under a minute to create a new exchange (syte). - DIRECT MESSAGES If you have an internet connection you can send messages to your friends. No need to worry about your SMS plans, just chat directly with friends.. - PHOTOs MIXER Stay in the mix with your friends’ photos as they post. But wait, you can also filter friend’s photos. You can still be friends, but not have to see all their photos all the time. You know the ones. - ACTIVITY WALL (ALL ACTIVITY AND EXCHANGES) Your wall keeps you in the loop of what is going on across all exchanges that you have created or joined. - NOTIFICATIONS You decide how you want to be notified. Just go to notification preferences and turn on the activities that you want to know about right away and those that you don’t. You're in control. Let’s get started and get connecting!
