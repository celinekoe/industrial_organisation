He began with a name and line of core products — chips, tortillas, and dip — that have become a staple in grocery stores across the Intermountain West. Drawing on his experience running the Little Pancho division of Clover Club Foods (a brand he would later purchase to compliment his thriving Don Julio product line), Fisher eventually decided it wasn’t enough to own the brand and sell the products, he wanted to make his own. In 2002 Fisher and his son Nate, vice president of Don Julio at the time, located and began operating a tortilla manufacturing plant in Clearfield, Utah, just minutes from away from where Fisher had learned the food business as a young salesman and entrepreneur. Press-lines now run three shifts a day, churning out fresh Southwest tortillas, which are delivered daily to local stores around the greater Utah area. Soon after beginning to produce their own product, Don Julio acquired Clover Club Foods, a company where Fisher cut his teeth in the food business back in the ‘80s. Widely regarded as the little company started by a woman in her kitchen in 1938, Clover Club had grown into a national brand, and Fisher wanted to bring that brand back home to Utah where it all started.",Travel and Tourism,,,1-10,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Similar to NetFlix, Book Pig delivers a package of books tailored to the children's tastes and reading levels. The service includes an excellent suggestion tool specifically for children's books, staff recommendations and the ability to queue individual books or entire series.  The service includes free shipping both ways and comes in a big red reusable box that's fun for kids. The service starts with a three week free trial and monthly subscriptions start at 11.95.  Cancel at any time. The goal of Book Pig is to get children to read more. Studies show that children who learn to read more do better in life. Freakonomics author Stephen Levitt states bluntly, ""Books in the home equal higher test scores."" We all know it's true, so with all that incentive... Why is getting children to read so hard?   We believe there are three basic reasons: 1. Books are inconvenient. Compared to TV where I can see something new and engaging with the touch of a button, a trip to the bookstore is a relative hassle. With reading you have to plan ahead and what looked like fun in the bookstore doesn't always look as fun back home. 2. Reading is a forced march. ""Read the book, take the test."" With so much emphasis on testing, schools teach children how to read but they don't teach them to love reading. It's just not part of their charter. So children are forced to read a lot books that simply don't interest them. 3. Children's tastes and reading levels change fast. What thrilled them last summer bores them today. We hear this from parents all the time: ""She has a shelf full of books and says there's nothing to read."" Well, she's probably right. Keeping a child's bookshelf filled with interesting books that match their reading level is a time-consuming and expensive task that's easy to fall behind on. These are some hard truths about children and reading, but there is an answer.   Book Pig tackles the problem head on: 1. We make reading convenient. Each month your children receive a box of books automatically without a trip to the bookstore.  This means there's always fresh unread books in your house.  Reach for the remote, reach for a fresh book - now it's the same effort. 2. We make reading a pleasure.  Packaged like a gift, Book Pig delivers books in a big bright red box.  It's filled with books designed to draw your children into series and fresh books that match their tastes and reading levels perfectly.  And if they don't like a book, send it back, with free shipping both ways there's no pressure to read boring books. 3. We keep the books flowing.  With each box of books we send a sticker pad your children use to note their opinion of each book.  Then we update their reading preferences and future books reflect their changing tastes and reading levels. We keep track of everything so there's no more falling behind.","Commerce and Shopping, Community and Lifestyle",2,"John Witchel, Tom Pigoski",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Creating sales tools for a competitive market, they were faced with a daily challenge of making sure those sales tools were easy to find, up to date, and most importantly, being used at the right time.

Their decision: the traditional approach to managing their sales tools via intranets or shared drives was woefully inadequate for what was expected of those sales teams. So, they founded SalesKB to make it easier for sales reps to find the right tool at the right time, making their customer conversations more efficient and meaningful.","Internet Services, Sales and Marketing, Software, Transportation",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Paying bills can be a low-stress event when interest rates are reasonable. Clay Advisors is here to help. The 3 keys to becoming debt free:  1) Complete Clay Advisors application: they aren't asking for anything complicated— just some estimates to help them get to know you.  Note: Your credit score will not be impacted; 2) Within 1 hour, you will be connected with your personal financial consultant who will get to know you, review our process, and answer any questions you may have; 3) Start making payments that are up to 50% less than your current payments. What is an unsecured low-interest rate debt consolidation loan?  Clay Advisors is offering you an unsecured low-interest rate debt consolidation loan for your unsecured high-interest credit card debt. A Clay Advisors debt consolidation loan is used to combine multiple debts into one. Instead of a pile of bills, you will have only a single monthly payment. By consolidating your unsecured credit card into a low-interest rate consolidation loan, you will know exactly how much you have to pay each month... and when you will be out of debt. While a debt consolidation loan doesn't eliminate your debt, it makes paying it off easier and more predictable.
