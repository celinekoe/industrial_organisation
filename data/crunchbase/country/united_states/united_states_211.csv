(later NeXT Computer, Inc. and NeXT Software, Inc.) was an American computer company headquartered in Redwood City, California, that developed and manufactured a series of computer workstations intended for the higher education and business markets.  NeXT was founded in 1985 by Apple Computer co-founder Steve Jobs after his forced resignation from Apple. NeXT introduced the first NeXT Computer in 1988, and the smaller NeXTstation in 1990. Sales of the NeXT computers were relatively limited, with estimates of about 50,000 units shipped in total. Nevertheless, its innovative object-oriented NeXTSTEP operating system and development environment were highly influential. NeXT later released much of the NeXTSTEP system as a programming environment standard called OpenStep. NeXT withdrew from the hardware business in 1993 to concentrate on marketing OPENSTEP, its own OpenStep implementation, for several OEMs. NeXT also developed WebObjects, one of the first enterprise web application frameworks. WebObjects never became very popular because of its initial high price of $50,000 but remains a prominent early example of a web server based on dynamic page generation rather than static content. Apple purchased NeXT on December 20, 1996 for $429 million, and much of the current Mac OS X system is built on the OPENSTEP foundation. WebObjects is now bundled with Mac OS X Server and Xcode.","Education, Hardware, Software",1,Steve Jobs,10001+,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Hot section airfoils must be able to maintain their structural integrity in an environment of extreme temperatures and corrosive gases. Their manufacture requires the use of special super alloys that are resistant to high temperature, oxidation, corrosion, and stress levels. The complex shapes required of these components can be achieved only with advanced investment casting technology. The dimensional control must be precise. Demand for such airfoils has led to two advances on the grain structure of airfoil castings: directionally solidified (DS) and single crystal casting. Both advances are attempts to increase the high-temperature threshold of airfoil applications by altering the grain structure of the metal. (Grain boundaries are the weak link in cast parts.) DS blades and vanes are solidified in a way that essentially orients all grain boundaries in the alloy in a single direction. As a result of this longitudinal grain alignment, both ductility and resistance to thermal fatigue is improved. Thus enhancing component life for our customers. Single crystal castings eliminate grain boundaries altogether, as parts are produced that consist of a single crystal. The current method employed to produce these castings requires the most stringent control of the solidification cycle and the entire investment casting process. PCC Airfoils, a leading producer of these components, has developed highly automated casting furnaces and investment casting processes for the manufacture of blades and vanes. Significant process development at PCC Airfoils with ceramic cores, solidification technology, computer modeling and inspection methods assures our continued strength in this market.

Grip Boost,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/grip-boost,"Manufacturing, Sporting Goods, Sports","Halethorpe, Maryland, United States",GB is a University of Maryland spin-out company that makes polymer-gel coatings to extend the life and performance of football gloves.,"274,762","Greater Baltimore-Maryland Area, East Coast, Southern US",Less than $1M,Active,2014-03-28,day,,,,,For Profit,http://www.gripboost.com/,"Grip Boost Inc. has developed a quick-drying polymer-based gel technology that extends the life and performance of football gloves. Football players at all levels of competition, from the NFL down to youth leagues, wear tacky gloves to enhance their ability to grip the football during the game. These gloves offer football players the extra tackified grip they need to make game-changing plays. Unfortunately, these gloves lose their tackiness/grip quickly due to intense frictional contact (e.g. glove-jerseys, glove-ground) experienced throughout practices and games during the football season; usually the grip on a pair of brand-new gloves wears down after just a few days of practice.  In response to this market need, the Grip Boost Football Gel was invented by a professional football player and team of chemical engineers at the University of Maryland. This new product is a quick-drying polymer-based gel. To use the product, a player simply applies a small amount of the gel onto his gloves, rubs his hands together, and a thin polymer film forms on the gloves in less than 15 seconds—rapid enough to apply between plays during a game or practice. The Grip Boost polymer-gel solution is completely non-toxic, employs green chemistry, and is produced from natural polymers that are found in crab shell waste. Additionally, the Grip Boost polymer film adheres to the gloves and leaves no residue on the football, which is crucial for legal usage.  The original inventors formed Grip Boost in Spring 2014 to propel commercialization of the gel technology; in Fall 2014, pilot scale batches of the product were sold online through GripBoost.com and the Amazon Marketplace. After strong reviews and positive feedback in football market, Grip Boost Inc. launched grip products in baseball and golf in Fall 2015 and Summer 2016. The company currently operates out of the UMBC Research and Technology Park as part of the bwtech@UMBC incubator program where it produces and sells the Grip Boost products on www.GripBoost.com, local retail stores and the Amazon Marketplace.","Commerce and Shopping, Manufacturing, Sports",5,"Chanda Arya, Harry Geller, Kevin Diehn, Matt Furstenburg, Zachary Rom",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
