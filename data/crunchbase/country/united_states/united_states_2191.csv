Some of the materials we work with include but are not limited to slate, architectural shingles, terra cotta, cedar, tin, copper, and plaster. As per the stringent Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties, we seek to conserve and to reuse historic materials and designs wherever feasible. We offer the following services: TRADITIONAL ROOFING We are master roofers / fabricators who repair (our specialty), restore, or rebuild the following types of roofs: slate, cedar, copper, standing seam, corrugated, tin, flat (EPDM + TPO + modified), tile, asbestos, midcentury hurricane shingles, architectural shingles, solar shingles (Tesla / Solar City), synthetic slate (aka â fake slate or plastic slate), concrete, ceramic (Ludowici), green / vegetated, thatch, anything else that has been or can be built, and any building system or component that interfaces with a roof (fascia / soffits / gutters / pole gutters / crickets / valleys / ridges / gussets / ornamental woodwork / chimney flashing / etc.). Please note that we take great pride in matching the original materials / building systems on historic roofs. No challenge is too difficult or inconvenient, even if we have to invent a solution or scrounge down a material that is located in another state or even another country. In this regard, the majority of roofs we service have been built before 1950 and often still rely on the same traditional building systems and materials; although, we do enjoy repairing more contemporary or atypical âmodern-eraâ flat roofs associated with the International Style / the Prairie School / Brutalism / and the like; or even those of prefabricated Sears Catalog Homes, anonymous rectilinear military / industrial buildings, or communal neighborhood theatres. As a brief list, we have repaired roofs designed by the following architects: Franklin Lloyd Wright (and his contemporaries), Wilson Eyre, Walter K. Durham, Junzo Yoshimura, Richardson Brognard Okie, Thomas Ustick Walter, Edmund B. Gilchrist, and many anonymous but no less skilled builders / artisans (before architecture became a profession). MASONRY CONSERVATION  Our approach to masonry conservation is from the perspective of building / objects conservation (otherwise known in stuffy academic circles as ""architectural conservation"") in which specialized artisans and mechanics combine the principles of both contemporary materials science and traditional pre-1950s trades to either conserve or restore historic buildings / sculptures / sites, often with the very techniques and materials that went into their original construction and which have been subsequently forgotten, ignored, or ""improved upon"" by the contemporary home renovation industry. This means that we typically use only the most compatible, breathable, and time-tested lime or silicate-based mineral cements or stains, in many cases imported or originally derived from France, the Netherlands, Canada, and other heritage-rich countries that prioritize the preservation of historic fabric; along with locally sourced replacement stone / brick, to affordably do the following: Chimney repointing and crown repair (our specialty â especially since we are equally skilled at traditional roofing), mortar matching (including the color and texture), hardscape restoration (e.g., patios, flagstone walkways, and gravel driveways), sculpture / ornamental stone / cemetery conservation (including mechanical pinning, composite / fill repairs, and the like), stucco repair (including traditional lime coating / patterning for colonial architecture, as well as more contemporary methods such as shotcrete or gunite for modern buildings), basement waterproofing and foundation restoration, interior plaster repair, masonry cleaning and repair (including the removal of surface soiling, as well as the restoration of lost or irrevocably damaged stone or brick), lintel or arch reconstruction, stone carving, and anything else that involves setting cement, ceramics, or materials quarried from the earth. CUSTOM METALWORK As experienced mechanics / fabricators with an extensive network of artisans and foundries, we can repair, install, or replicate any metalwork that interfaces with a traditional roof / gutter / drainage system, such as vent collars, valleys, pole gutters, downspouts, ice cleats, flashing, crickets, gussets, standing seam panels, soldered pent roofs, conductor heads, and anything else that can be bent on-site with a break or replicated in a foundry. We can also accelerate the green or black patina on suitable metals such as copper; as well as fabricate or conserve ornamental fences, weathervanes, furniture, railings, sculpture, awnings, land art, objects, casement windows, and custom designs from spec. FINISH CARPENTRY With a team of versatile restoration carpenters and finish craftsmen, we can conserve, repair, replicate, or replace most types of historic woodwork â soffits, fascia, molding, windows or window framing, doors, rafters, ridge beams, joinery, columns, tongue-and-groove flooring, furniture, porches, etc. â as well as conserve, replicate, apply, or remove any kind of interior or exterior wood surface coating, paint, or stain. The full list of our capabilities is too much to mention here given the diverse and venerable tradition of woodworking in Pennsylvania, which ranges from the vernacular to the more modern, but as a sample of our carpentry projects, we have recently done the following: Restored a completely rotted out midcentury pediment, using only specialized rot repair epoxies and zinc-copper; hand carved new sections of ornamental woodwork for a 1920s-era Main Line estate; repaired or replaced countless soffits / fascia that have rotted behind defective or poorly maintained gutter systems; rebuilt colonial pole gutters in Chadds Ford; preserved or stained multiple irreplaceable doors, many of which date back to the late 19th or early 20th century; repaired or painted the often aluminum-covered cornices of numerous Philadelphia townhouses; conserved, insulated, or painted hundreds of historic windows; and stabilized the full range of collapsing historic structures (portico columns, porch roofs, floors, and the suchlike).

Wilson Fans are the ""life-blood"" of Social Marketing Fans make up the core of a community. Without fans, you don't have a community. The more fans you have, the bigger your community is. In Social Marketing, EACH FAN who follows you is exposed to ALL of your marketing messages. The value of having 1 fan has been calculated to be at least $3.60/year in EARNED MEDIA VALUE alone. How do you get Fans? To get fans you need 3 key components: An interesting and relevant reason for existing An active and vibrant Fan/community page A reason to join and to stay How do you Leverage Fans without losing them? Leveraging fans means getting them to do something. (read an advertisement, share the page with their friends, invite their friends, write reviews, buy something, donate something, participate.). Each time you ask a fan to do something, you risk losing fans. There are 2 things that help keep fans: Don't ask too often. (no more than 1-2 posts per day) Give rewards whenever possible. (make the post rewarding, with content or real rewards) The Karmaback Platform Karmaback's Social Platform has solved the key challenges in Social Network Marketing: Fan Growth and Leveraging Fans. We've found the right mix of sacrifice and reward that users find a positive social exchange: a community building experience. Reward Karmaback has found that rewarding users for doing stuff is the best way to motivate fans to do anything on social networks. We have developed a reward points system that allows users to earn points for anything they do. and exchange those points for real stuff (more chances to win, prizes, free stuff, etc.). Sacrifice Doing stuff on social networks is a sacrifice for the user. Karmaback makes it easy (and rewarding) to do stuff on behalf of a fan's company. Our platform asks users to become a fan to enter a sweepstakes, to share the sweepstakes with their friends for points, and to opt-in to email lists, write reviews, leave comments, and so-forth for points towards real rewards. Growing Fans Karmaback uses Social Sweepstakes as the primary method of growing fans. A Sweepstakes has an immediate reward effect as you are given the opportunity to win something for participation. Ideally that something is related to the brand/product involved. A Sweepstakes gives a user a reason to join. and also gives you current fans a reason to stay. Leveraging Fans Karmaback uses its reward system to motivate sharing of sweepstakes and viral spreading of messages and fan growth. Viral spreading of the Social Sweepstakes leads to greater fan growth than just a sweepstakes alone. In addition, Karmaback's reward system can be used to reward any desired behavior (getting your friends to sign up, posting to a blog, writing a letter to an editor, reviewing a site/video/product). This can lead to greater fan growth and fan involvement (leading to loyalty).","Apps, Data and Analytics, Gaming, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Navigation and Mapping, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
