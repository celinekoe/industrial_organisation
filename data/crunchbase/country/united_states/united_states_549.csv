All of us at CPP are honored to carry on his work and his vision to “help millions of people, including our employees, develop themselves.” Myers-Briggs® Assessment But our roots reach even deeper than that. The Myers-Briggs® assessment was first developed in 1943 by Katharine Cook Briggs and Isabel Briggs Myers. This mother-and-daughter team were among the most prominent pioneers of personality assessment. In 1975, CPP became the exclusive publisher of the Myers-Briggs instrument.

Technology CryoMedix has patents pending for four components that comprise its next generation cryoablation platform technology. Single Phase Liquid Coolants: A group of compounds which have the unique attribute of remaining in a liquid state between room temperature and -190°C when maintained under slight pressure. The characteristics of these compounds provide for significantly more wattage/power than current gas systems. This superior cooling capability provides the ability to completely ablate nerves and tissue anywhere in the body. Feedback System: The feedback system provides the physician information regarding the status of the creation of the ice in real time. This system also allows for the automation of the freeze cycle thereby increasing the ease of use and the ability to consistently obtain good clinical outcomes. Increased Surface Area Designs of Disposables: Catheter or needle with a multitubular configuration and/or a corrugated surface. The disposables can be rigid or flexible. These designs result in a significant increase in surface area of the disposable resulting in a proportional improvement in the effectiveness of the cooling agent thereby allowing for use of smaller diameter size disposables or a faster freeze. Rechargeable Cartridge System:  The rechargeable system is a small refrigeration device that chills the liquid coolant to the desired temperature. The small insulated canisters of approximately 2-16 ounces, depending on the particular application, are pre-chilled and maintained at the desired temperature until used in a procedure. The canisters are reusable. The use of a small rechargeable cartridge system eliminates the need for the large tanks of gas required by other cryoablation technologies. The recycling of the cooling agent is environmentally friendly and represents another factor that contributes to the lower cost of the platform technology. The superior power and capability of CM’s technology has been demonstrated in a number of animal studies done on behalf of other companies as well as in an animal study performed at the University of San Diego Medical Center by Greg Feld MD, Chairman of the UCSD Electrophysiology Department.  This latter study confirmed the ability to create transmural linear lesions of up to 8 cm in length in the heart with none of the safety concerns associated with heat ablation. Additional expected benefits of this technology are the improved clinical outcomes, the ability to consistently attain this superior clinical result through the use of the feedback system, the significant reduction in the procedure time and the substantially lower cost of manufacturing the disposable component of the device.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",2,"Alex Babkin, William Nydam",1-10,1,,500000,USD,500000,500000,USD,500000,,,,,Private,,,,,,
