Online auctions have removed the fun of going to actual auctions, the interactions between the bidders, the ability for the auctioneer to increase the interest in the lot by interacting with the bidders and encouraging participation by the bidders.  Anyone that has been to an auction and has bid online will note the drastic differences between an online auction and a live auction.  Granted, you can attend an online auction from anywhere, but that is where the benefits stop.   Our Platform: Puts the social interaction between the bidders and the auctioneer back into the online auction platforms, allowing bidders to get the best of both worlds.  They will have the interaction of a real auction and, at the same time, attend the auction from anywhere in the world.    Business model is focused on larger items that tend to have bidders within a 100 mile radius.   Our software is designed to act and respond like a live auction house.    Additionally, we have two very unique bidder tools.  The first is our auction block which reflects all items in any auction the bidder is registered in that have less than 3 minutes to close. These items will all be shown on one easy to read page.   The second tool we have in place is live social interaction (Real Time Chat) between bidders and the sellers (Auctioneers).  We encourage the seller to participate by adding color commentary to the items when they can.     The seller only needs to create the event for the actual auction event and the bidders will be able to go to that auction event and see all of the items in the auction.    Through the use of Geographic Licensee, we will be establishing local brand ambassadors that operate their own business through the use of our software platform.","Commerce and Shopping, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment",,,1-10,1,,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

We are just average people that want to help others fight the battle that we have all been through.  We can only give advice on what has helped us or others in the past. We are here to listen, offer our support and guidance to let you know your not alone.    We know how hard it is to deal with someone you love that's an addict. The way they act, the way they treat you, and how it doesn't seem like the same person you used to know.  We also know that sometimes itâ€™s hard to talk to your friends or family members because they may not understand what your going through or may judge you. We understand because we have been there and know how difficult it is. How mentally and physically draining it can be. When your brain is telling you to give up on someone but your heart is screaming to help the person that you used to know before the addiction.   We know you don't always want to sit face to face with people you don't know. Sometimes you want to remain anonymous. Sometimes you just want to be sure your doing the right thing. Ask An Addict allows you to do all of these on your own time and when you feel you need it.   This site is not intended to judge but to offer help, support, advice and hope to the addicts and people affected by addicts. We want addicts to feel at home here too. We want and need the recovering addicts to help others get through where they used to be. Addicts can offer some of the best advice based on their experiences and can help other addicts in recovery.
