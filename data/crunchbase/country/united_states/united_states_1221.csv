UNICEF has the global authority to influence decision-makers, and the variety of partners at grassroots level to turn the most innovative ideas into reality. That makes UNICEF unique among world organizations, and unique among those working with the young.  UNICEF believes that nurturing and caring for children are the cornerstones of human progress. UNICEF was created with this purpose in mind – to work with others to overcome the obstacles that poverty, violence, disease and discrimination place in a child’s path.  UNICEF believes that they can, together, advance the cause of humanity.  UNICEF advocates for measures to give children the best start in life, because proper care at the youngest age forms the strongest foundation for a person’s future. UNICEF promotes girls’ education – ensuring that they complete primary education as a minimum – because it benefits all children, both girls and boys. Girls who are educated grow up to become better thinkers, better citizens, and better parents to their own children.  UNICEF acts so that all children are immunized against common childhood diseases, and are well nourished, because it is wrong for a child to suffer or die from a preventable illness.  UNICEF works to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS among young people because it is right to keep them from harm and enable them to protect others. UNICEF helps children and families affected by HIV/AIDS to live their lives with dignity.  UNICEF involves everyone in creating protective environments for children. UNICEF is present to relieve suffering during emergencies, and wherever children are threatened, because no child should be exposed to violence, abuse or exploitation.  UNICEF upholds the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  We work to assure equality for those who are discriminated against, girls and women in particular. UNICEF works for the Millennium Development Goals and for the progress promised in the United Nations Charter. UNICEF strives for peace and security. We work to hold everyone accountable to the promises made for children.  UNICEF is part of the Global Movement for Children – a broad coalition dedicated to improving the life of every child.  Through this movement, and events such as the United Nations Special Session on Children, we encourage young people to speak out and participate in the decisions that affect their lives.  UNICEF is active in more than 190 countries and territories through country programmes and National Committees.

Ferrante's sons, Armand and Alfred, eventually took over the business and opened two more stores under the name Great Bear Market. In the 1950s, Armand met Thomas Buscaglia, owner of T.A. Buscaglia Equipment Company. He asked Armand to partner with him and Armand agreed to join Thomas in a joint venture, Niagara Frontier Services. At that time, Savino Nanula was also a key member of their team. Armand had great passion for food, people and his community. He was also a visionary, experimenting with ideas that they are quite advanced for that time. Excited by the growth of modern day ""supermarkets"", Castellani and Buscaglia partnered with a group of independent Bells store owners, including Alfonse and Leonard DiMino, among others who joined them as key partners in their early and expanding retail grocery enterprise. In 1962, the group opened its first true modern supermarket, a 25,000 square-foot store on Portage Road in Niagara Falls, NY. That same year, Alfonse DiMino suggested the name TOPS and the team chose that name because they were determined to give customers the best shopping experience possible. In the lingo of the 60s, that meant it was 'tops'. The 1970s saw TOPS, under the leadership of Armand Castellani and Savino Nanula, continue to grow in Western New York and thrive where competitors struggled. By the mid-70s, the company had expanded into the Rochester area. Store growth continued throughout the next decade and during this time, TOPS opened its first Pennsylvania location in Bradford, PA. 1991 was a pivotal year when TOPS was acquired by Ahold, a major international food retail conglomerate based in the Netherlands. In 2001, TOPS formed an alliance with Giant Food stores, a fellow Ahold company, based in Carlisle, PA. That structure remained in place until 2006 when Ahold announced that they would sell TOPS Markets to Morgan Stanley Private Equity. In the fall of 2007, then president and CEO Frank Curci, led the deal that returned TOPS Markets back to local operation. In 2010, TOPS acquired The Penn Traffic Company, a deal which resulted in TOPS bring 64 new stores into its family. In July 2012, TOPS announced its purchase of 21 Grand Union Family Markets stores. In April 2013, TOPS introduced a brand-new, specialty food market in Western New York, 10 miles south of Buffalo. This new concept, named Orchard Fresh, gives shoppers a unique combination of specialty, upscale and gourmet foods with a focus on natural and organic, a strong emphasis on the health-conscious consumer, and food items sourced both locally and globally. In November 2013, six members of TOPS' executive team, led by now Chairman and CEO Frank Curci, purchased the company from Morgan Stanley Private Equity, returning TOPS back to complete local ownership. Tops Markets. LLC, is headquartered in Williamsville, NY and currently operates 172 full-service supermarkets along with an additional five supermarkets operated by franchisees under the Tops banner. Currently Tops employs over 16,000 associates. Tops is a leading full-service grocery retailer in upstate New York, northern Pennsylvania, western Vermont, and north central Massachusetts.","Commerce and Shopping, Food and Beverage",2,"Armand Castellani, Thomas Buscaglia",10001+,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

On the demand side we serve independent mortgage lenders who need short term funds to finance the mortgages they originate from time of funding until sale to the permanent loan investor.   Our online exchange makes it simple for the mortgage lender to upload a data file of collateral that they wish to use to obtain financing.  The loan data and the collateral trust receipt are uploaded into our proprietary exchange system, X-Spot™.  Once the lender submits the collateral for financing bid, X-Spot™ validates the data through a network of internal and third-party data providers.  We also incorporate CoreLogic’s LoanSafe product which appends to the collateral data file a Collateral and Fraud Risk score.  These scores as well as any of the collateral data is searchable and filterable through X-Spot™.   On the supply side, an investor simply funds a trust account and completes one or as many bid profiles they desire.  Bid profiles are simplistic yet they have the ability to be as granular as the investor desires.  These profiles determine which collateral is eligible for a bid from the investor.  The investor bids a desired participation percentage, a cash advance percentage and an interest rate.  All of this can be done globally or at an individual transaction level.   X-Spot uses proprietary algorithms to match credit profiles and participation bids.  The lender is provided three choices – optimize for cash advance, optimize for interest rate or utilize X-Spot’s proprietary optimization.  We also have a third party who provides first loss coverage on the loans providing further credit protection for the investors.  On a risk return basis, our current annual yields of ~3% to the investor are far superior to other liquid cash alternative in the marketplace.","Financial Services, Real Estate",1,John duHadway,1-10,2,Seed,115000,USD,115000,330000,USD,330000,,,,,Private,,,,,,
