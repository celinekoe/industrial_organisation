(Jeff) Travis is currently practicing as an accountant in the Chicagoland area specializing in health care professionals, restaurants, real estate and construction, and manufacturing companies. The majority of his clients are physicians. Since the majority of Jeff’s clients are also “start-up” companies, his expertise in accounting software, consulting and taxes makes his services an excellent choice for any entrepreneur.  His career in public accounting started at a mid-size CPA firm. After ten years working for another mid-size suburban CPA firm, Jeff started his own firm in July 1995. At this time, Jeff’s interpersonal skills of presenting tax and accounting seminars at many hospitals in Chicago in front of resident, fellow and attending physicians blossomed into a practice niche for individual and business clients throughout the United States as many of clients moved out of the area and began their careers in other states.  Because of this, Jeff’s knowledge of taxes of a variety of states is valuable to understand the tax ramifications of moving to a different state, including the US territories.  Jeffrey B. (Jeff) Travis is a graduate of Northern Illinois University with a B A in Accountancy. He was a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.

We purchased the LLC (East End Creamery LLC) which included the building and property. We modeled the BBQ after a very successful concept in Orlando Florida called 4 Rivers Smokehouse.   The BBQ restaurants in Upstate NY are usually full service, while we offer cafeteria style with a comfortable and rustic atmosphere. We pulled capital together from different sources for the remodel, kitchen equipment and start-up costs.  We are seeking to combine  this debt and raise the needed capital for promoting the restaurant, operational expenses, the addition of a bar in the loft area and a second location (The Little Bucket BBQ) in a new downtown building project called the Plaza of the Arts. This location will be in combination with a self-serve yogurt shop and a cafe serving Starbucks coffee and tea (We will be using our restaurant name """"Rosalie's"""" that has been in existence for eighteen years in Skaneateles, NY).  We will be smoking and cooking everything at the main restaurant to reduce build-out costs of a full kitchen and there will be limited labor in just serving our food at this location.  The city of Auburn has been promoting a Musical Theater Festival with the construction of multiple theaters, a Hilton Garden Inn and new restaurants/bars in the downtown area. They call it """"Broadway in the Fingerlakes"""", in which they have  spent millions of dollars to attract tourism to the area by developing this theater district for the future revitalization of the city.  The city is becoming a destination with the musical theater festival and the promotion of it being """"History's Hometown"""" as the birthplace of talking movies, The William Seward Home , The Harriet Tubman House and other historical attractions.  We are seeking $375,000 to combine the present start-up debt, operational expenses, expansion and the new location.
