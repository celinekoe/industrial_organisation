In a class at Rensselaer called Inventor's Studio, they applied this new process for binding together insulating particles, creating Greensulate. Rather than just decreasing the environmental impact of conventional polystyrene foams, this invention creates a whole new paradigm where composite materials are literally grown, harnessing the incredible efficiency of nature. Shortly after founding the company, they won small grants from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and the National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance (NCIIA). This funding was used to create initial samples of the material. This proof of concept enabled the company to win bigger grants from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to further develop the products. Since then, Ecovative has won many more awards and grants that have enabled the company to continue to grow and accelerate the production of these revolutionary eco-friendly materials. At Ecovative, they are passionate about sustainability. That is why they are working with nature to replace unsustainable plastics and foams with natural composites.

Arhalofenate is a novel oral small molecule being developed to treat the approximately 1 million gout patients that flare three or more times per year. Gout flares are painful inflammatory episodes caused by crystals of monosodium urate (MSU) that result from excess serum uric acid (sUA). In three Phase 2 studies in gout patients arhalofenate was shown to reduce the incidence and duration of flares while simultaneously lowering sUA. If confirmed in additional clinical studies, arhalofenate’s dual acting profile would be unique since all other urate lowering therapies paradoxically increase flares as they lower sUA over the first 6 to 12 months of treatment. Increased flares lead many patients to stop or avoid treatment leading to progression of disease with pain and suffering, erosion of joint structure and functionality, lost time from work, and increased healthcare costs.","Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",1,Sujal Shah,51-100,15,IPO,502133640,USD,502133640,710205694,USD,710205694,"T.
