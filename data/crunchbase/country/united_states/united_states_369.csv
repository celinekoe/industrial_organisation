AskNshare,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/asknshare,"CRM, Market Research","Tucson, Arizona, United States",AskNshare offers a disruptive social media powered market research platform for consumer service providers.,"2,631,176",Western US,,Closed,2009-01-01,year,,,,none,For Profit,http://www.asknshare.net,"[AskNshare](http://www.asknshare.net) is a disruptive social media powered market research platform for consumer service providers.  The site has been launched in Shanghai, China in late 2009. **AskNshare** platform offers it's registered members to publish AskNshare (formerly known as surveys) to exchange information. It also allows members to publish images and videos via an AskNShare. The business members obtain valuable market research info from the members via onsite/online Asknshare completed by consumers.  Why AskNshare is disruptive? Because AskNshare model of marketing challenges Traditional Advertising Model (TAM). Bose explains in the following [LinkedinForum](http://www.linkedin.com/groups/What-is-relationship-between-Tsunami-2224264.S.80133299?view=&gid=2224264&type=member&item=80133299&trk=NUS_DISC_Q-ttle). AskNshare is not a traditional survey site. In traditional survey, individual's response is not critical; survey focus on group's cumulative response. In AskNshare, we understand the value of individual's preference in decision making process; for example, a Shanghai resident goes to an Indian restaurant, not because 95% Shanghai residents never tried Indian food. He goes to an Indian restaurant because he prefers the company of an Indian friend there. This uniqueness could not be caught in a traditional survey based marketing process. AskNshare can identify the ""human magnet"" for the Indian restaurant; and this ""human magnet"" can attract future customers to the merchant. This model is completely different from mass mailing, TV ads and search engines. The history of AskNShare goes back to 1991 when [Ashoke Bose](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/ashoke-bose) founded [Communication Software, Inc.](http://www.csi-us.com) to provide market research services to various government agencies in USA. Bose enrolled in graduate program Computer science at the [University of Arizona](http://www.arizona.edu) during 1984-1986, In early 1987, Bose accepted a position as Academic Computing Specialist at Center of Computing and Information Technology (_CCIT_) at the University of Arizona. It 1989, quite surprisingly, Bose accepted a position as Senior System Programmer at the [Social and Behavioral Sciences Research Institute](http://web.sbs.arizona.edu/college/research) where he got involved in survey methodology and human networks. Unfortunately, in late1990, there was recession in USA, and the university of Arizona was funded by the tax payers.  There was university wide layoff; Bose was forced to leave academic computing world to devote himself in corporate computing.  In 1994, [CSI](http://www.csi-us.com) obtained domain name OpinionUSA.com to conduct opinion poll via internet. In 1995, _OpinionUSA_ conducted simulated USA Presidential Election via internet. The prediction was incorrect (Bill Clinton was the actual winner) due to fact that internet use was not as common those days. In 2002, the Perl script based survey building tool got replaced by Java code to add more functionality. The purpose of OpinionUSA was to use internet as a media to replace CATI (Computer Assisted Telephone Interview) systems. In 2007, Ash Bose moved to Shanghai to work in a Fortune 50 company. In 2007, Ash decided to create a new platform for Chinese consumers. With the help of local Chinese programmers, Ash started to build AskNShare platform.","Data and Analytics, Design, Information Technology, Sales and Marketing, Software",3,"Ashoke Bose, Chun Yu Chen, Dave Banerjee",11-50,2,Seed,600000,USD,600000,600000,USD,600000,Bose International Investement Fund,,1,,Private,,,,,,
