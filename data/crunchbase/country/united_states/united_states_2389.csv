The beauty of properly frozen food is convenience – our meals are ready whenever you need them. All of our Ice Age Meals are made in small batches by our team of Culinary Ninjas, and nothing makes it onto the website without a rigorous testing period. Every meal begins with me – I cook it up just like I would for my family. Then my team and I adjust flavors and textures, whip up a bigger batch and make adjustments again. And we freeze the dish to check out how it reheats. If it doesn’t meet our crazy high standards, it doesn’t make the cut and we move on. Every meal you can buy here on the site starts with whole cuts of meat and fresh veggies. We do everything the right way – grass-fed and organic meat from family ranchers, proper cuts to enhance texture, lengthy marinating times, toasted spices, the whole nine yards. I’ve been cooking for over 20 years, and I’m humbled and excited to bring tasty, nutritious food to the masses. And hey, if you mosey over to PaleoNick.com, I’m teaching you how to prepare meals like these yourself. I invite you to browse the site, check out our meals and try one out today. If you have any questions, we’re happy to answer them. You can reach us at info@paleonick.com. Thanks for stopping by.
