We are constructing Thermomagnetic Generator systems that can successfully capture and convert waste heat from any industrial, solar or geothermal source. No additional fuels are required and ZERO CARBON EMISSIONS are produced. A tremendous amount of thermal energy is lost as steam, hot gas or radiant energy (60 Quadrillion BTU's/year!). Despite this fact, few efficient & cost-effective solutions have been developed to utilize waste heat to generate electric power. This is especially true for waste heat streams below 500 °F (260 °C). The main limitations with current technology have been due to high cost, low efficiency & maintenance issues. With our technology, we will be now able to harness the unused heat energy which is normally released to the environment from large industrial sites such as power plants, cement factories, steel mills, buildings, vehicles and other areas.  Our innovations will have a tremendous worldwide impact by saving our clients money and offsetting the need for electricity produced from dirty fossil fuels.","Energy, Sustainability",1,Franz Bronnimann,1-10,1,,,,,,USD,,Cleantech Open,1,1,,Private,,,,,,

Although 19th century Italy is regarded as a home of modern pizza, it roots go all the way back to the ancient Roman, Greek and Persian empires. The records from those times depict various types of bread in round and flat shapes, with various toppings on top. Although many European civilizations continued to use meals created in this fashion even up to today(coca from Catalonia and Valencia, Greek Pita, Turkish Pide,Lepinja or Solmun in Balkans), the cooks from Italy became most interested in pizza. They produced various pizza products from the ancient times to the middle ages.  In the preserved ruins of the Italian city of Pompei, archeologist found unmistakable signs of the network that supported pizza production – from the street stands to the restaurant kitchens were pizzas were made. Most important ingredient that elevated local Italian dish to the worldwide famous pizza was arrival of the tomato from the New World in 16th century. Although Italian nobility regarded tomato as a poor man’s food, the inventive recipes and designs of Italian pizza cooks from Naples soon managed to change their minds. As the popularity of the pizza grew, pizza makers started to expand their business. The first restaurant dedicated only for selling pizza was opened in Naples in 1830, and after that many more appeared across all Italy. The pizza from witch almost all designs are based was created in the 1889 by the hands of the famous Naples chef Raffaele Esposito who made three pizzas for the King and Queen of Italy. His design of pizza Margherita became gold standard for all future pizzas.","Clothing and Apparel, Community and Lifestyle, Design, Food and Beverage, Travel and Tourism",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Company Background: Launched from Atlanta-based incubator StarPound, Teledini represents a commercial application of the long-held vision for a more collaborative Web. Teledini enables instant interaction over multiple communication channels from within a company’s website at the instant a site visitor is ready to buy, thereby increasing the rate of conversion of web visitors into customers. Problem: Despite investing countless hours and dollars on content, design, pay-per-click advertising, and search engine optimization, businesses take an average of 42 hours to interact with a visitor to their site. As a result, the conversion rate of website visitors into customers for most businesses is unacceptably low (1-4%). Solution: Teledini enables instant interaction between the website visitor and the site owner, while simultaneously delivering valuable data about the visitor to the owner, improving conversion rates by as much as 60%. Products/Services: Teledini’s instant interaction tools can be placed on any website in less than 20 minutes. Teledini is completely free to set up and easy to install. Website owners simply copy and paste a few lines of code into the footer of their website. They don’t pay until they are connected to a purchase-ready customer. Teledini’s solution is comprised of three integrated components: Call2Action EngagementWindow Website owners can place a unique Call2Action button on each page of their website. When a visitor clicks the Call2Action button, a sleek EngagementWindow slides out. Web visitors are offered a myriad of ways to connect with the business and can choose the interaction method they are most comfortable using. The choices include: Click-to- Talk, Click-to-CallMeBack, Click-to-Chat, Click-to-Video and Click-to- Message. Contact numbers and location information for the business are also delivered in the EngagementWindow. Teledini’s Call2Action EngagementWindow replaces the traditional “contact us” page on a website that is both antiquated and proven ineffective. DecisionEngine Teledini features sophisticated interaction routing. Each interaction is delivered to the right person at the right time. Web owners can choose to simultaneously ring multiple numbers, people and devices based on product or page. Salespeople have the flexibility to determine how and when they can be reached most effectively by choosing their numbers, devices and availability. CallerIQ CallerIQ helps to maximize the value of customer interactions by displaying key information about a web visitor at the instant the interaction is delivered to the right person. This enables immediate relevant responses to the web visitor and opens up tremendous tracking capabilities. CallerIQ reports make it possible to track online campaigns, banner advertising and site performance on a page-by- page basis not only periodically, but in real time as desired. Statistics show that the odds of entering a sales lead into a sales cycle increases 21X if contacted immediately vs.only 30 minutes later. With Teledini, live sales and customer service has never been easier. E-Commerce sites can reduce shopping cart abandonment by resolving technical, administrative and product-related issues. They can up-sell additional products or services to increase their average revenue per order. Research has proven live interaction systems boost online sales at least 60%.","Commerce and Shopping, Hardware, Other, Professional Services, Software",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
