With so many messages that range from demeaning to judgmental to exploitative, their mission is to create a media website that speaks directly to women and with them in mind. What makes Feminspire unique is that their content is driven exclusively by female contributors. They know their audience because they are their audience (seriously – not only do they write for Feminspire, but they enjoy reading it, too). Their goal is to give women a place in the media where they can speak up and have their voices heard. A note about intersectionality: Feminspire was created by a white woman living in America, and many (although not all) of their staff members are white women and women who live in Western countries. They don’t claim to be able to represent all women within their content, but they strive to do the best they can.

Leaders are severely over-worked and under-appreciated.  Severe burn out and career changes are a result.  Retreat facilities and conference centers are two things that are used to attempt to combat this ever growing problem.  However, both are inadequate on their own.  Retreat centers offer short term escape from the reality of everyday life; but reality still exists after returning from the retreat.  Conference centers teach attendees how to handle problems; but the solutions learned are nearly always conceptual and do not address the specific problems of the attendee. Rocky Mountain Oasis has combined the retreat center with the conference center and addressed the weaknesses of both.  An oasis is a place to escape the deadliness of the desert and to become refreshed and equipped to continue the remainder of the journey.  So is Rocky Mountain Oasis.  The Rocky Mountain Oasis experience begins with the oasis on the horizon.  We invite specific leadership teams to our facility and customize their experience so that they receive precisely the escape, the rejuvenation, and the tools they need to be able to go back out into life and complete the journey.  This begins with pre-stay interviews and preparations, continues with a time of retreat and conference at our facility, and culminates with post-stay follow-up and encouragement.  The Rocky Mountain Oasis experience ends when the leadership team has reached the edge of the desert and no longer needs nurturing or encouragement. Our owners (Joe & Kathy McCarn, and Sharon Stoeber) have spent the past eleven years (and perhaps their entire lives) preparing for this endeavor.  With the right experience, contacts, and education, we are now prepared to help others to reach more of their potential.","Community and Lifestyle, Education, Other",3,"Joe McCarn, Kathy McCarn, Sharon Stoeber",1-10,1,,55000,USD,55000,55000,USD,55000,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Calder Interactive Persona Technology- The Gartner Group has predicted that ""By 2015, 10 percent of your online ""friends"" will be nonhuman. Social media strategy involves several steps: establishing a presence, listening to theconversation, speaking (articulating a message), and, ultimately, interacting in a two-way, fully engaged manner. Thus far, many organizations have established a presence, and are mostly projecting messages through Twitter feeds and Facebook updates that are often only an incremental step up from RSS feeds. By 2015, efforts to systematize and automate social engagement will result in the rise of social bots â€” automated software agents that can handle, to varying degrees, interaction with communities of users in a manner personalized to each individual.   Our Calder Interactive Persona Technology is making that possible today everywhere, on your PC, mobile device, Television, and your car dashboard. Calder Interactive Persona makes finding gathering, and organizing information from the internet more human. Calder SocialOS Technology- Calder SocialOS (SOS) cures search overload and app overload, with  personalization anywhere and everywhere you access the internet (your car, tv, PC and mobile device. We offer universal connectivity through a new OS extension that gives the power to the user and universal control through the operating system. Calder SocialOS sets on top of any mobile and desktop OS  providing the user a new experience that totally changes how consumers feel when using the underlying operating system.  We provide a standardized open SocialOS layer that will offer an extensible interface that standardizes access to social networks and search facilities across machines, networks and infrastructure. Networks and social systems can be added simply via plug-ins to the provider interface. In a format that is consumer and enterprise administration friendly. Did you know that there are well over 15 million ""apps"" today for mobile and desktop computing devices today? Social Apps are causing fragmentation of information sources, and users have no filter or way to control the flow of information or what information we see via social network streams/feeds.  We have developed a new system that returns control to the user that makes using â€œappsâ€ optional, but through standardized social network data type plug-ins the OS has universal access to the sites youâ€™d normally access via an application, but with all of the standardized security  and personalized intelligent stream filtering per user.  We bring a consistent experience across data services and web sites via SOS and the Calder Interactive Persona that is business ""admin"" and consumer ""parent"" friendly. Privacy Concerns today are great. Users are stuck with whatever  privacy systems that are in-place per system in-web browser. We bring these streams into SOS and universally adjust privacy based on what the users needs are. SOS solves frustrations over data streams and organization lack of in-stream filtering and search capabilities that are universal over social networks by providing these capabilities.. Our solution is geared toward complete customization and synchronization over the cloud. learners need a system that allows them to not only collect and organize information, but also dynamically update and curate it. It should allow them to record their own insights about, and responses by others to, a particular thread such that it remains tied to the concerned topic and its organization... tree."" all via human voice interaction when combined with Calder Interactive Persona Technology. Multiple identity management systems that are confusing and proprietary even with Open ID and Open Data protocols.  We unify identity management across platforms and across systems via the â€œcloudâ€.  Including personal preferences management. We also provide synchronization, machine intelligence, and get you to the information you want anywhere you are at. Calder Cloud Personalization Engine - Calder Global Networks, has created an ecosystem around it's technologies (persona, search, infotainment and SocialOS) that allows ubiquitious computer wherever you are at. Thanks to our cloud personalization engine we can get at the information you want anywhere you are at (across systems (desktop, mobile, and auto and geographic locations).  Our new paradigm gets you the information you are looking for when you want it across space, time, devices and locations. Our technology is not just about synchronization and ubiquitous computing, but is also about revolutionizing search by putting a human interface to it, adding privacy and security, but also about getting to the information you want to know faster. Most search engines provide you with pages of information you have to sort through and take time to sift through to get to the information you want. Our new technology will change how we get your answers in a more human way thanks to our cloud computing technology. It also opens up an entirely new paradigm for custom advertising solutions. No more paid placements to distract you, just the information you want while also opening up a whole new medium for advertising.. Did you know that only about 6% of the world's knowldege is actually available from a web search engine ? Our search technology also bridges the gap betweeen internet search engines and internet data sources that are not available else where, in a meaningful directed way.
