Larry and his team of fellow entrepreneurs foresaw the convergence of storage and networking and the large amount of processing power and bandwidth consumed when moving data across the network. To solve this problem, the team designed Dynamic TCP Offload and cast it into silicon and has now taken it a step further by leveraging this technology in the form of an NFS acceleration appliance.

Pete was diligently working in eastern Wisconsin with a variety of staffing agencies, but something was missing. He loved caring for his patients, but felt that staffing agencies were exchanging compassion for competitiveness. He was determined to change that. As a result, he started Nurses PRN in 1995, with the PRN brand itself dating back to the 1970’s. PRN’s goal was to become a model for the healthcare staffing industry – staying competitive in the marketplace, and maintaining a compassionate heart. Over the years Nurses PRN grew and evolved as a nationwide healthcare staffing company, and therefore wanted to be more inclusive to all valued healthcare professionals: nurses, allied health, locum tenens, CNAs, and more. This led to the introduction of PRN Healthcare, which is inclusive of all of our healthcare divisions. Our mission to create authentic, meaningful relationships with our healthcare professionals helps us set them up for success in their dream assignment, whether that be a travel contract, local contract, or per diem shift. This is all driven by the simple idea that better care for our healthcare workers, leads to better patient care – and this is all supported by a dedicated internal staff. Our company culture is strongly backed by faith-based values and activities, to remind us that our success provides us the opportunity to serve and give back to our communities. This is the spirit of caregiving. This is PRN Healthcare.","Administrative Services, Health Care",1,Pete Hietpas,1001-5000,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Private,,,,,,
