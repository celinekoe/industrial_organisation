Paying via debit at the PoS in CO, CA, and other more developed industries exists, however, these systems operate as disguised ATMs, and incur many different fees as a result. This leads to a markup of >$10-15 in most cases. Rhizomatiq is a DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) Utility Token based on the DAG-Tangle architecture; this allows for high efficiency, resistance to attacks, environmentally green operations and most importantly an incredibly high throughput rate for instant transaction authorization. Built on top of the DLT is a suite of Supply Chain Track/Trace algorithms that provide transparency up the Cannabis Supply Chain for Regulators, Consumers, Suppliers, and Merchants alike. This suite is a logistics tracing mechanism, that follows batches of tested Cannabis products throughout the distribution process; from seed, to sale. Rhizomatiq aims to streamline this process, and act as a base for the Cannabis industry to build on. Due to the efficiency and scalability of the DAG-Tangle architecture, we are able to offer extraordinarily low fees (.25% S2M / $1 C2M per Tx), and instantly approved transactions. The process is simple and intuitive. SEND / RECEIVE transaction pairs represent completed ""seeds"". These seeds are stored on ""nodes"", our word for the Account Tangle architecture. Transactions on the node are verified using a standard Random Selection algorithm. Before either a SEND or RECEIVE transaction is sent, a dense regulatory compliance process is completed in which the Account Holder's ability to partake in the transaction is verified. Rhizomatiq Tokens are Utility Tokens, therefore transactions are initiated as payment transfers to and from the senders and receivers payment methods, respectfully, and the Tokens themselves will never be able to be Bought or Sold.","Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Community and Lifestyle, Financial Services, Food and Beverage, Health Care, Other, Transportation",1,Samuel Troyer,1-10,1,Seed,,USD,,,USD,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
