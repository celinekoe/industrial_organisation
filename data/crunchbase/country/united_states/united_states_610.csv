Members can both “create a date” at the restaurant of their choice to be advertised along with their profile on the site or confidentially “show interest” in existing dates, where their profile will be visible only to the date host.   The problems this business is addressing are the following: Efficiency: Traditional online dating websites require an average investment of 10 hours online to meet someone offline. Our innovative approach streamlines this process from mate to date to a mere 10 minutes. Additionally, by allowing the member to preselect the day, time, restaurant and eventually the individual with whom he/she will meet, the process is mutually beneficial and convenient for both parties as the reservation is made automatically and all members have to do is show up and meet. Confidentiality: All profiles are private by default and dates can be scheduled without exchanging any private information. Additionally, these confidentiality measures prevent individuals from wasting time scanning hundreds of profiles on subscription based websites where 90% of profiles are “inactive” meaning not paying for a monthly subscription and thus unable to communicate online with other members. Our solution to this problem is that only active “dates” and their associated profiles are visible. Therefore members are only able to preview the profiles of those individuals offering dates or, as the host of a date, preview the profiles belonging to the individuals who are interested in their date.","Events, Media and Entertainment, Software",2,"Glen Andrianov, Melissa Andrianov",1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

(Lu) Taylor, an Industrial Engineer. Both had extensive experience in the fiberglass industry. The first products were fabricated fiberglass components for the 2.75 Rocket sold to the United States government. Imaginative R&D led to the creation of a proprietary fiberglass filter coalescer in 1957. This revolutionary product was initially introduced to both military and commercial aviation fuel markets and subsequently to pipelines and refineries. Velcon now supplies more replacement cartridges to purify jet fuel than any other company in the world. In 1979, Velcon introduced to the market its patented Aquacon® water-absorbing cartridges which remove water and dirt from industrial oils and fuels, restoring the oil or fuel to a clean, usable condition. The outer layers of filter media remove particulate contaminants, while the inner layers chemicallyretain water within the super-absorbent media. As the cartridge reaches its absorption capacity, the media expands rapidly to restrict the flow of unfiltered oil or fuel, signaling the operator to replace the cartridge. In 1991, Lu Taylor became Chairman of the Board and his son David C. Taylor assumed the position of President. Dave Taylor brought with him a broad range of technical and management experience. Velcon’s commitment to quality has been recognized through its achievement of the ISO 9001 Certification of Registration in 2000. Most recently Velcon has requalified for ISO 9001, proving its continuing achievement of quality standards. Velcon is also the first filter manufacturer to receive qualifications for all three categories of the EI 1581 5th Edition Specification. In April 2009, Velcon Filters, LLC was acquired by Sterling Group, LP, a private equity investment firm that targets controlling interests in basic manufacturing, industrial services and distribution companies. The Taylor family and members of management continue in their roles as substantial shareholders in Velcon in partnership with Sterling. “The Velcon team believes this partnership will provide significant opportunities to further develop and expand the company’s reach,” said David Taylor, who remains CEO of Velcon. In November, 2009, Velcon acquired Chemflo, a process filtration company, creating “Velcon Process,” a division of Velcon Filters, LLC. Chemflo was founded in 1998. Velcon Process works as partners with petrochemical producers, refineries, transmission companies, gas plants, food and beverage producers and other process industries to improve their overall process as it relates to filtration and separation. In 2010, in an ongoing effort to ensure quality products, Velcon constructed a diesel fuel test lab at its Colorado facility. Now Velcon is poised to verify the effectiveness of its filtration products for the rapidly expanding diesel and biodiesel market.",Manufacturing,,,251-500,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Trust is important in any business, but when it comes to consumer tracking on Web and mobile digital platforms, trust – by the consumers, customers and operating partners who touch the system – is more important than ever. That’s why DataNeutrality was created, in conjunction with sister company Mezzobit, to establish a truly trustworthy ecosystem of privacy and data security compliance. DataNeutrality plays the role of policy-maker and watchdog in this ecosystem. As an independent not-for-profit organization, DataNeutrality sets the rules that Mezzobit must play by when it comes to data security and privacy protection. DataNeutrality then monitors Mezzobit’s performance to ensure compliance, and reports on the results to Mezzobit customers and the public. Taken together, DataNeutrality and Mezzobit constitute an entirely new paradigm in privacy and compliance engineering, and one that embodies many principles from compliance– and privacy–by–design as well as Regulation 2.0 transparent governance.","Information Technology, Other, Privacy and Security, Social Impact",,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
