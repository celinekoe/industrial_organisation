Our system relies on trained on site first responders who can effectively neutralize an active shooter.  These first responders are already being placed in schools across the country - they can be professional security guards, law enforcement officers or in some cases, teachers and other school staff.   They need immediate and accurate position information to get them to the scene of an emergency - The Dragon Net provides this service.   The Dragon Net will augment existing security systems in an affordable platform - or can stand alone in remote facilities or outdoor venues where large groups of people gather for work, entertainment or education.   It's designed to empower the staff at these various facilities with the knowledge that if something terrible happens, someone will be there in seconds.    Many facilities continue to add layers of access control and physical barrier systems to restrict entrance.  These systems can be breached and we have seen that those barrier systems can also restrict outside agencies when they are needed on site during an emergency.  Our system is designed to provide security from the inside out.  911 is also notified, so they will be on the way.

Video chat doesn't work well for large groups or social situations because only one person can speak at a time. GroupRoom allows participants to move around the space and collaborate with others near them. For example, three people on one side of the room can have a group conversation with a whiteboard or google doc etc completely separate from a group of two people on the other side. Collaborate and socialize with up to 50 participants per room. Connect multiple rooms together like an actual expo or conference. No time limits with end-to-end encryption for all participants in every meeting. GroupRoom is the next best thing to meetings, conferences, classrooms, break rooms, and even happy hours in real life (IRL)!",,1,Chris Matthieu,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

For months, Brentwood-based Clinton has been scouting for sorely needed venture capital to bring his cardiovascular monitor to market.  If Nashville money doesn't soon step up, Clinton may be forced to deal with investors who'd require he relocate the company. He said Wednesday that of four potential investors (none from Nashville) who are currently in pre-deal due diligence with him, ""ALL firms have heartburn about this being a Nashville-based company."" During Clinton's sorties to such investment watering-holes as Menlo Park-Palo Alto and New York City, he said he was ""disappointed"" to find that in the minds of investors there, ""Nashville doesn't even exist."" Wednesday, a similar conclusion was delivered by a panel of experts assembled for ""Financing the Deal,"" a conference sponsored by the Nashville Health Care Council and attended by more than 450 executives. Not to worry: Program moderator Senator Bill Frist, M.D., now a partner with Cressey & Company, said that no matter how flat the rest of the economy gets, how steeply banks ""deleverage"" or who's in the White House come January, ""we're going to be putting more money in healthcare.""  Still, if Nashville casts a smaller-than-expected shadow on the investment landscape, that could limit local companies' and investors' participation in the next wave of growth.",Health Care,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Camille started her career in 1995, as one of the first web developers for Comcast-NBCUniversal, producing nbc4la.com (the very first local TV news website in Los Angeles). A couple of years later, Sandra joined Camille as the Senior Developer for a tech-startup now known as zap2it.com, a popular TV listings & news website. Camille and Sandra worked together, once again, as Executive and Senior Consultants to spearhead the launch of e-business for top music companies like EMI, Sony, Universal, and WEA. Camille then set her sights on creating a content management system for the TV industry, in which BAMTOOLS was born. Meanwhile, Sandra was recruited by carsdirect.com as a Senior Java Developer, where she mastered Enterprise Commerce. Eventually, Camille and Sandra rejoined forces to create Westside Websites, an innovative web engineering company dedicated to providing digital solutions for Entertainment & News, Corporate Intranet and Extranet, Crowd-Funding, Contest, Promotion, Video Streaming, Email Blast, Group Message Boards, Content Management Systems, and Text-to-Vote, to name a few.

The women banded together to innovate and bring their application to market — an exciting new way for to utilize visual, gesture, audio, and speech-to-text recognition using element detection within videos. ""We're invaluable to sales and marketing teams, not just IT,"" says Sandra, ""We solve roadblocks and improve efficiency in ways companies communicate with each other and/or their target audience through digital solutions."" ""Our clients hire us to execute their creative concepts using the latest web technology,"" adds Camille, ""We also enjoy collaborating with many advertising and creative agencies in town as their tech counterpart.""
