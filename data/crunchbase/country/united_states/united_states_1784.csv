The video sections are cleaned and then converted to a format of the user’s choosing. SproutConverter is essential software for both professional media conversion studios and home users.  SproutConverter is an indispensable program to use in combination with iMovie or Final Cut Pro to batch clean your digitized VHS, Hi8, 8mm, Video8 tapes, and more, removing video distortion, video noise, blank spaces, and static.  No longer will you have to painstakingly edit your home movies and videos to remove distortion caused by wear and tear on your old video library. The cleaned versions can be saved in many popular video file formats — SproutConverter automates the entire process, saving you time and money!  SproutConverter works by comparing your video to a library of specifically chosen video and movie distortion filters. Advanced users may also specify particular frames in their videos for SproutConverter to use as additional examples of distortion.  -----------------------------------  Multimedia video files sometimes contain blank spaces, static, noise, artifacts, distortion, feedback, and other glitches, which occur in-between the normal video segments. These blank or noise affected sections cause the video to play back with gaps and stutter. If there are any blank or distorted frames in a video, existing video editing software requires that you manually remove them. This process requires repetition involving manual search and removal.  Features:  ☆ Patent pending cleaning method to remove distortion from videos.  ☆ Convert your files using popular file formats and codecs, then automatically add them to iTunes.  ☆ Automatically combine your movies in to a single video after filtering and conversion.  ☆ Customizable filter library which allows you to add your own images as filters to the conversion process.  ☆ Batch conversion enables you to convert multiple files at once.  ☆ Includes Instant-Save for any file in MOV format. Any video imported with FinalCut and iMovie can be filtered and then instantly saved.","Content and Publishing, Media and Entertainment, Software, Video",1,Tommy Tornroos,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
