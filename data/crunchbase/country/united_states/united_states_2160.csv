Everyday discerning shoppers are wanting to supplement their normal grocery purchases with top-quality local products. For that demand there are only a few options and none of them are ideal for most consumers. The consumer must try to find time in their busy schedule to travel to a farmers market. Consumers can shop at a high end grocery store like Whole Foods where the quality is good but most products still aren't coming from local sources. There are other local options available like CSA boxes but they do not combine choice, quality, and convenience.    THE SOLUTION  The Find Veggies solution is connecting busy consumers with locally made, quality products. Consumers can shop, check out, and have them delivered. Very simple and convenient for their active busy lives.    Our solution helps the farmers market vendors. Currently vendors and farmers have limited ways to get the word out about what products they have for sale. They are busy creating or growing their products all week and don't have time or knowledge to market their goods. Find Veggies will act as the marketing arm for the vendors by driving more customers to them and increasing sales.    THE COMPETITION  We know there are others in the fresh vegetable business. Many high end retailers like Whole Foods and Spouts. Many cities have CSA boxes however these do not allow you to pick what you want and when you want them. Some startups have tried to solve the farm to phone problem but Find Veggies approach is different. We are not replicating warehouses or grocery stores. We simply extend the sales beyond the farmers market stall.","Agriculture and Farming, Food and Beverage, Mobile, Software",,,1-10,1,,,,,,USD,,VTF Capital,,1,,Private,,,,,,

Makers are expert in their craft, but not necessarily expert in engaging current customers, nor attracting new customers. Additionally, makers are generally not well suited to articulate their own compelling genesis stories, nor are they able to facilitate rich customer experiences on a steady basis. Ultimately, customers value experiences over the simple act of purchasing products and services. As such, many makers are not well positioned to capitalize on a variety of revenue generation opportunities inherent within an easily facilitated customer development-focused fan experience.  Solution: Makers Tour increases client market share and revenues by orchestrating growth-focused encounters between makers and their fans.

This translates into a parenting dilemma, now that 2 out of 3 American kids use tablets. Without regular use or practice, educational apps bear little benefit. With the Learn & Earn app, parents motivate kids by connecting learning goals to actual rewards. E.g, parents may set a goal that says ""If my child does 10 mins of math for 20 days, I'm willing to spend $10 in rewards."" Kids start off by choosing one of 100s of rewards to earn. Once they meet their goal, the app helps initiate purchase via Amazon.com or iTunes, so kids receive the reward at their doorstep. The app is available for US Grades 1-4 math, covering 100s of skills and a 500,000+ questionnaire.
