They were sharing stories and advice on their experience working with various service and solution providers. Now by providers, they mean those businesses that provide solutions and services for other businesses such as printing, marketing, graphic design, web development, and strategy, just to name a few.  In their past lives working in everything between startups and Fortune 50 companies, they collaborated quite a bit with these various providers.  They found that some were extremely good across the board, quite a few were pretty good but often in one area vs all of the services they advertised, and some that were just plain…well, awful.   They found that along the way, one of their greatest challenges, was the ability to simply locate a top provider that was exceptional for the project they need fulfilled – you know - someone that produced consistent high-quality work, communicated in a timely manner, stuck to timelines and most importantly, “WOW’ed” us with the end result.   The problem is that when you’re looking for a provider, often times, its guesswork.  You either base your decision on the top search results by a Search Engine, word-of-mouth advice from others, random online reviews, a sales pitch by a rep or most likely, blind faith.  So, they figured that there had to be a better way to capture these “conversations”, improve one’s ability to find and select providers to meet their day-to-day needs, and in doing so drive the “economy” of how businesses work with providers.      And thus a single conversation, became the start of a two-year journey to come up with an ideal solution that would simplify this entire provider selection and management process, equipping businesses with the necessary resources and information to find the right providers for their business.",Information Technology,1,Travis Shipley,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
