Internet users can then  type keywords into the search box to find  result pages containing those links. The basic concept behind Aglepie is that any search result page is basically a piece of real estate. We provide our members with the posibility to own these search result pages. A result page also called a ""PiePage"" is created by a website owner. The name of the piepage is the same as the search query that was typed in by the user. So when a user search for ""aglepie"" they will find the piepage named ""aglepie"". On joining a website owner will receive free piepages. They can use these to create (name) new piepages. The position of the website owner who created the piepage, will always be on top. So when users search for""aglepie"" they will find the link of the website owner, in this case aglepie.com, on top. This link is called a ""blue piead"". The website owner can add text, but also images, videos, tweets etc. to their piead. This information can be updated any time the website owner wants. If other website owners want to place their link on a  piepage  they did not create,  they have to settle with a â€œwhite pieadâ€ on that page. The difference between the two, blue pieads are permanent and always stay on top of the page while white pieads move op a list according to their most recent update. If  the piepage name is a trademark of your company, you can turn that piepage into a trademark piepage. This means that you alone can place links on that piepage. You can further personalize your trademark piepages by adding a background image. Members who do not have a trademark, can turn a piepage that contains their website url, into a trademark piepage. For example, â€œaglepie.comâ€ can become a trademark piepage, but so can â€œaglepie.com/our-favorite-websites/â€.  As long as its one continues word with your domain name in it, you can turn it into a trademark piepage. There is great freedom when creating piepages and pieads, members are only limited by their creativity and a few rules to keep it all honest.",Internet Services,,,1-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,

Financing at a dealer is convenient but rarely results in the best terms available. Loans are often placed with factory captive lenders or placed with the lender that allows the store to make the most money; not the lender that offers the best terms or rate. C.A.R. has only one goal: get you the best terms available so your loan fits your needs. We use our pool of lenders and our experience in negotiating with them to be sure your best interests are the highest priority. It is never too early or too late to refinance your loan and save money as we do the work for you. Applications are absolutely free and while we cannot answer every request as demand for financing is at an all-time high we will treat every application with care because you work hard for your money and so should your bank.
