Drawing inspiration from Indonesian desserts his mother made, Sam created the signature recipe of what is now every fan's favorite Mochi Muffins. To make it all happen, Wenter worked full-time while Sam spent all day baking. They then drove around delivering their pastries to the six wholesale coffee shops they had locked down contracts with–all without fail. Soon enough, their Mochi Muffins gained a huge following throughout the Bay Area for remaining relevant to today's culture and tastes while still holding a hint of nostalgia. After just one year, they had expanded to over 60 wholesale locations with a team that included bakers, delivery drivers, retail staff, and managers—with more than 20 individuals on board.

We are a design-driven company with core medical AI technology capable of diagnosing disease, catching hidden high-risk diagnoses, and projecting the development of patient’s health into the future. Built around our core AI engine, our first product Remedy Sentinel helps value-based providers identify hidden chronic, co-morbid conditions and intervene by engaging high-risk patients prior to onset.  We envision a world where healthcare marries the science of “health” with the art of “care”: scientific, data-driven decision making drives the best outcomes for each individual patient, and frees providers to focus on applying their human touch. Remedy combines novel artificial intelligence algorithms for predictive medical analytics with a healthcare-optimized product development process to give leaders the tools they need to transform their delivery networks and thrive in a value-based care environment. With this approach, Remedy builds a scalable suite of products that, when deployed, learn from experience, and grow into a solution optimized to fit the needs of specific provider groups and the populations they serve. Remedy systematically maximizes the patient health outcome achieved with each dollar spent by using AI to help determine what care is delivered to whom, when it is delivered, where it is delivered, how it is delivered, followed, and supported, and who should deliver it. We not only surface insights, but also build the necessary tools and helps coordinate step-by-step implementation processes to affect real change.

Executing on that idea we shook up the web hosting industry when we introduced Managed WordPress Hosting to the world. The first ever Managed WordPress Hosting platform was born and kicked off a renaissance in customer and application-centric hosting. Since then, Pagely has become the WordPress hosting market leader in innovation, speed, scalability, and security with thousands of clients trusting our impressive and forward-thinking infrastructure. Our clients range from the largest tech companies to universities, creative agencies, city and state governments, magazines, ski resorts, and other large and midsize businesses. We've done it by sticking true to the singular focus of treating our customers right. We have 4 key features that are custom-built and unique to us: PressDNS™: Latency and Geographical targeted routing for your WordPress site. PressDNS™ works with our PressCACHE™ system to route requests, at the DNS level, to any of our global cache nodes (geo-routing). Powered by Amazon's route 53 service PressDNS™ makes it simple to take advantage of geo balancing and geo routing. PressCACHE™: A global network of DNS routed cache nodes explicitly designed to serve WordPress page output. Your site, available instantly, from anywhere. PressCACHE™ is a global WordPress acceleration system available for use by our clients. It works much like a CDN but specifically designed to cache and serve WordPress page output. Essentially, a request for your website is routed to one of our global PoPs (Point of Presence) closest to the user. This shortens the distance between the user and your website thereby speeding up the load time of your site to a global audience. PressCACHE™ is available to all customers using our PressDNS™ nameservers. PressCDN™: Photos, images, and static assets served from a global network of servers. Faster download speeds for your site visitors. All of our plans come with our CDN built specifically for WordPress, PressCDN™, which is powered by backend providers that include MaxCDN. That means your static assets are served according to the provider which has the closest location to your site’s particular visitor. For example, if your visitor happens to be accessing your site from Chennai India, your static assets may be served by Amazon Edge, since they have a location there. Having multiple providers on the backend means more efficiency and faster load times for your users. PressARMOR™: A comprehensive security architecture developed by Pagely that hardens and protects our network, hardware, and WordPress applications. The primary focus is on prevention and the mitigation of risk to clients. Secure WordPress Hosting is just how we do business. For base-level security, we utilize a dynamic web application firewall (WAF) that blocks code injection attacks, known exploits and rate limits access attempts. This greatly reduces the chance of a DDoS attack or Brute force attack succeeding. We also practice chroot user separation and real-time system malware scanning. Scanning for malware means we’re constantly looking for things like trojan horses, viruses, worms, keyloggers, spyware, and adware. Additional rule-sets at our network edge filter out much of the nefarious traffic long before it even has a chance to pass into our network.","Content and Publishing, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Software",2,"Joshua Strebel, Sally Strebel",11-50,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,1,Private,,,,,,

With investment and resources from IAC and Xtreme Labs (acquired by Pivotal), each entrepreneurial startup team rapidly prototypes new applications and services to best serve the evolving world of mobile.  Hatch is not an accelerator.  Hatch hires and nurtures technology entrepreneurs and improve a world built, consumed, and reinvented by the wireless generation. Hatch Labs successfully deployed all the capital from the first fund, building over 10 startups from ground up in two years, including Tinder, one of the fastest-growing social discovery companies globally.   Tinder: Following an early alpha concept of Tinder (then Matchbox), which won an internal hackathon in Feb 2012, judged by Dinesh Moorjani, Hatch's CEO, Sean Rad and team expressed continued interest in building the product.  Hatch green lighted the refocus of the team, who was passionate about the problems surrounding social discovery, from Cardify to Tinder following the TechCrunch Disrupt Finals in NY in May 2012, Tinder's development commenced.  The founding team built successive versions of the product in closed beta, testing the user experience.  Dinesh moved to the Tinder offices two months prior to help oversee the launch.  Under Sean's guidance and with Justin Mateen joining the team to innovate and accelerate marketing efforts in Sep 2012, Tinder successfully seeded the consumer market at prominent Universities, resulting in rapid, organic growth.  Under Hatch's guidance and leadership from the founding team led by Sean Rad, Tinder was spun out of Hatch Labs with additional captive funding to become a rapidly growing company. Although IAC and Xtreme Labs expressed a continued commitment to the second Hatch fund in Aug 2012, Hatch closed new investment operations of the captive fund, with IAC and Xtreme’s support.  With the financial relationship from the first fund in tact, Dinesh spun out the rights to operate Hatch II independently to streamline the investment committee and separate public company operations from Hatch's needs.","Hardware, Mobile",2,"Adam Huie, Dinesh Moorjani",11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,
