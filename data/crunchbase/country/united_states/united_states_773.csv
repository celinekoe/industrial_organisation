Tekmos has since 1997 been a reliable source of ASIC devices for hundreds of companies interested in replacing legacy microprocessors, ASICs, and FPGAs via conversions. Every product is designed here in the USA and after wafers are processed and die assembled, will be tested and shipped from Austin, Texas to any location worldwide.

Founded in 2006, Sky Development is the brainchild of entrepreneur and real estate developer Yizhak Toledano. Carrying the lessons and principles instilled in Yizhak as a young man growing up in Israel has been the foundation upon which this dynamic and innovative company is based.

Each member of the team is fully invested in the success of the company and is passionate about the real estate development sector and the role that they play in it. Sky Development harnesses the skills and talents of people across diverse sectors: architecture, construction, finance, design and development. It’s a close-knit team led by one a visionary entrepreneur. Sky Development started small; two small-scale apartment  building renovations in Miami, but their success and vision led the company to pursue its founding dream – the development, construction and successful sale of multi-use buildings and complexes for Florida families and businesses. The complexes comprise residential units, office space, commercial and retail buildings. The developments were an immediate success and continue to be few of the most groundbreaking and innovative developments in Florida. Sky Development – Bringing Florida Families Home  From the ultra-luxurious villas and homes at ‘Villaggio on the Lakes’, with 223 manor homes and a fully equipped business and leisure center, to the striking design of the ‘Bay Towers’, ideally located on the Space Coast, close to Cape Canaveral and directly opposite the Kennedy Space Center. Sky Development is one of the few premier real estate development companies in Florida that believes in complete market assessment, years before any ground is broken on a new development or building.  Every aspect of the assessment is evaluated by a team of independent assessors to consolidate and ensure the success of each project. This sort of pre-planning has played an important role in establishing Sky Development as a market leader and a well-known resource on real estate investment in Florida. The company has a division devoted to asset management and often acts as a third-party advisor for other real estate developers in the state. Expansion across America – Sky Development in Nevada Sky Development has recently completed ‘The Residence at Canyon Gate’ in Las Vegas, Nevada. This is the ultimate in residential living and offers investors and families the chance to experience resort style living in a secure environment with the modern conveniences and entertainment facilities.

It was then that James Sargent, a bright and inventive young sales agent for Yale & Greenleaf Lock Manufacturers, made the decision to build a lock that would offer a level of security that far surpassed any device available at the time. The result of his resolve and genius was Sargent's Magnetic Bank Lock, the first successful key changeable combination lock. The lock gained almost immediate acceptance from safe manufacturers and the United States Treasury Department, bringing financial stability and paving the way for James Sargent to continue bringing new ideas and products to the security industry.  In 1865, one of Mr. Sargent's former employers, Halbert Greenleaf, became his equal partner in the firm of Sargent & Greenleaf. A manufacturing facility was built in Rochester, New York, and the company remained in that city until 1975. James Sargent was never one to rest on the success of past achievements. In 1868, he invented Sargent's Automatic Lock, bringing refinements to the original Sargent's Magnetic Bank Lock.  Then, in 1873, using parts from locks and two, eight-day kitchen clocks, Mr. Sargent created the first time lock to be installed on a bank vault door. He personally connected the time lock to the vault door of the First National Bank in Morrison, Illinois, on May 26, 1874. This lock continued to secure the vault for nearly forty years until the bank was remodeled and a larger vault was built.","Consumer Electronics, Financial Services, Hardware, Information Technology, Lending and Investments, Manufacturing, Privacy and Security",,,11-50,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,1,Private,,,,,,
