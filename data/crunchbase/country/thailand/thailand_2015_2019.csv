You could stop anywhere you wanted, sleep with the comfort of a mini modern home environment, and we would do all the driving for you.  In  sense, you would have your own personal guided tour, along with your own private driver/Chaffeur, and not have to worry about planning your trip by hotels or worry about hotel overbookings.  If you saw something you wanted to see along the way, or on the map, we would just make the necessary road detours and we could be off to the next destination.  While all of our drivers are mature, America-born natives, this would be an ideal opportunity for the foreign family who would like to visit the U.S., and not worry about navigating maps.  And, you could interact with real Americans and you would decide how long we stayed at any one area.  You would not have to deal with the typical tour America package that rushes you from place to place, and takes you to company sponsored attractions that are usually boring and placed in the tour to make you spend money at those sponsored tourist traps. That is the company mission of the RV Road-Trip USA, Co., Ltd.  company.",,,,
