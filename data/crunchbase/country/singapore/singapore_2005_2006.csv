Supply Chain Asia,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/supply-chain-asia,"Communities, Logistics","Singapore, Central Region, Singapore",Supply Chain Asia is a community that is currently headquartered in Singapore.,"1,482,514",Active,2005-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,http://supplychainasia.org,"Mr. Paul Lim established Supply Chain Asia (SCA) in 2005 with the vision of building a strong and well-connected community for the growing supply chain and logistics industry. Under Mr. Lim’s leadership, the organization grew and has since gained widespread recognition by professionals from both within and outside of the industry over the years.  SCA’s first ever event was held in March 2006 at Bangkok, Thailand. During the day of the event, there were demonstrations on the streets of Bangkok to outstate the prime minister at that time. On the January of the following year, SCA returned to Bangkok for its second event. This time, there was a bombing taking place. Both events have proved that holding events overseas is a huge challenge for SCA due to the unstable political climates that result in unpredictable situations. Hence, events are moved to Singapore and all major SCA events have been held in Singapore since then.  In 2011, it attained its not-for-profit status with the support of many government agencies such as the Economic Development Board (EDB). The not-for-profit organization then went full speed ahead with the goal of becoming the community of choice for the next 2 years. In 2012, SCA, which was previously ran singlehandedly by Mr. Lim, started forming a full-time team. By the end of 2012, the company had 7 employees and a part-time supporting editorial team, each covering different aspects of SCA and play different roles in supporting the president.  Besides the formation of the new team, the company officially took over the publication of the Supply Chain Asia Magazine in December 2012. The magazine was established by Mr. Frank Paul and Mr. Turloch Mooney in 2006 and operated as a separate entity from SCA. In January 2013, SCA publishes its first ever issue of the Supply Chain Asia Magazine with new outlooks and directions.  In the same year (2012), with the support of the Infocomm Development Authority (IDA), SCA launched its very own SC Asia mobile application. This is another big leap forward for SCA as members are now able to view e-copies of the magazine on their smartphones as well as access their portal contents through a comprehensive and user-friendly platform.  On January 24th 2013, the company has officially inducted its Board of Advisors consisting of many senior executives from huge global firms. The company has also formed a Shippers’ Council consisting of shippers across industries to facilitate more focused discussions on critical issues and challenges faced.  The year 2013 is an exciting year for Supply Chain Asia as this is the year that will determine the success or failure of the company’s new direction. Members of the community are keeping their eyes on SCA to see what else the company has in store for them and veterans of the industry claimed that are looking at a community that has potential to be a stronger and more recognised one.",,,,

Web design is tailored to fit the client’s particular budget, needs, and target audience.  Pay-Per-Click (PPC) On The Air Media ensures the client’s results remain front and center on search engine results – despite the vagaries of Google rankings. This is conducted through a pay-per-click (PPC) analysis and campaign. These sponsored ads ensure that potential customers searching relevant keywords arrive to the client’s website first. PPC is the company’s primary activity, with its preferred service provider being Google AdWords.  SEO Campaign The next stage of the process is evaluation of SEO effectivity. On The Air Media both runs software and utilizes SEO specialists to ensure a broad and accurate assessment of the client’s organic search results. Once analysis is complete, the company launches a specially tailored SEO campaign. Higher rankings on Google are achieved by increasing content quality and quantity, strategically employing keywords, and expanding social media presence.  Social Networking Management Social Networking Management is employed to tackle two core platforms: Facebook and Twitter. Depending on the company’s services, YouTube and Instagram accounts may also be launched. On The Air Media has increasingly devoted its budget to setting up and managing stellar social media campaigns in light of social media’s tremendous potential. The focus is on creating shareable content and establishing the client’s value on diverse platforms – with an eye to visual appeal.  Email Newsletters In addition to investing in a strong social media presence, On The Air Media continues to rely on email marketing campaigns. The company’s newsletters share engaging and useful information with customers and potential customers, delivered to their inbox sparingly and strategically. This is another avenue from which the firm drives traffic to their clients’ websites.  On The Air Media offers different packages to clients, with the option of choosing an all-inclusive campaign that includes all of the above options.",,,,
