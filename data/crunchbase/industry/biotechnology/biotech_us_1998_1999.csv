Mr. Pandolfino questioned, coffee without caffeine and beer without alcohol is commercially available so why aren’t tobacco cigarettes without nicotine a choice for consumers? Further, he hypothesized: If it were possible to produce tobacco cigarettes without nicotine, smokers could use these extraordinary cigarettes to successfully quit smoking. A paradox to be sure. Nonetheless, Mr. Pandolfino’s hypothesis stemmed from his careful observation of real smokers. As an importer of tobacco-free herbal cigarettes, Mr. Pandolfino had come to realize that some consumers were using nicotine-free herbal cigarettes to successfully quit smoking. Anecdotal evidence suggested that this approach was actually effective. The biggest problem with the novel “therapy” was the fact that herbal cigarettes have distinct taste and aroma characteristics which greatly limit their consumer appeal and acceptance. Indeed, although various processes were developed to improve these nicotine-free herbal cigarettes, it became clear that their peculiar taste and aroma characteristics would never appeal to mainstream smokers.

To date, they have closed over 15,000 septal defects worldwide. Ultrasept, their latest family of products, serves as their 7th generation of septal closure devices. The dual articulating sails allow for easy deployment of the devices and create a super low profile within the atria. Ultrasept devices boast a simple, hands-free loading feature and are fully retrievable before and after release. Ultrasept products include double-round devices for the percutaneous closure of both PFO’s (Patent Foramen Ovale) and ASD’s (Atrial Septal Defect). A septal occluder is a cardiac implant that fixes a cardiac defect commonly referred to as a “hole in the heart."" Our devices are delivered through a catheter by an interventional cardiologist and only take about 30 minutes to the implant. Many patients are admitted to the hospital in the morning and return home that afternoon or the next day without the lengthy recovery periods often needed after open-heart surgery. The market for their septal occluder products revolves around the need to close or fix a number of both pediatric and adult cardiac defects. The PFO (Patent Foramen Ovale) defect appears to occur in approximately 25% of the adult population. Most people have no symptoms and therefore require no treatment; however, it is now believed that about 250,000-1,000,000 cases worldwide per year may require closure. These people initially experience a cryptogenic stroke and upon follow-up with their neurologists are revealed to have a PFO defect. If the defect is not closed, these patients are subject to repeated strokes. Similarly, ASD’s (Atrial Septal Defect) appear in approximately 100,000-150,000 cases per year worldwide. Over time, if the defect is left unrepaired, serious cardiac problems can arise. Another possible application for the Ultrasept PFO devices is with regards to the relationship between PFO’s and migraine headaches. Presently it is known that approximately 50% of all migraine sufferers have a PFO.

When combined with cancer immunotherapy, CytoCure's drugs will enhance patients' ability to recognize and destroy their own malignant tumors. CytoCure scientists have discovered a process by which tumor cells lose expression of genes encoding immune targets. This process of ""antigen silencing"" is a common finding among tumors. CytoCure scientists have shown that the loss of these antigens is often due to reversible gene regulation. Proprietary CytoCure technology is based on overcoming tumor-produced factors that induce loss of tumor antigens, thus assuring that the tumor cells continue to express the antigenic structures that will allow the immune response to destroy all tumor cells in the tumor mass. Since the loss of tumor associated antigens currently represents a significant limitation to the success of cancer vaccines, the re-introduction and/or up-regulation of antigen expression will be a necessary adjunct to these therapies. Although the anti-tumor immune response can be markedly enhanced by strategic vaccination, the ability to destroy the tumor is dependent on the continued expression of the target antigen. CytoCure's technology provides for a platform to assure the continued expression and regulation of ""antigen silencing"" to enhance immunotherapeutic treatment of cancer.",,,,
