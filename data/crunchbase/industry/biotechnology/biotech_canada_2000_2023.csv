ScarX’s lead candidate, SCX-001, will be the first prescription cream for the reduction of post-surgical scarring.  ScarX is committed to improving the lives of surgical patients worldwide by providing therapies that prevent and reduce the occurrence of disfiguring, uncomfortable or cosmetically unattractive surgical scars.  ScarX was established in 2012 through partnerships with Toronto’s Hospital for Sick Children (Sick Kids), MaRS Innovation and MaRS Discovery District.  ScarX's dermal scar technology is based on over 15 years of research conducted by Dr. Benjamin Alman as a senior scientist and head of Orthopedic Surgery at SickKids.  Dr. Alman discovered that nefopam, a known active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), is an effective anti-scarring agent.  ScarX immediately developed a re-purposing strategy to advance nefopam for scar treatment and reduction, and has recently competed preclinical studies.  The company is now poised to take SX-001 into Phase I/IIa clinical trial.  Every year, more than 100 million people in developed countries worldwide experience dermal scarring resulting from surgery.  Scarring can have significant physical and psychological implications, from reduced function to disfigurement and emotional trauma. Despite this significant unmet need, no clinically-proven prescription anti-scarring treatment is available on the market today. In the U.S. alone, the estimated market potential for an effective anti-scarring treatment is over $4 billion USD annually.  ScarX is currently focused on developing its topical agent, SCX-001, to reduce scarring following cosmetic and reconstructive plastic surgeries. Reconstructive and cosmetic surgery market segments have the advantage of representing a significant portion of the overall market and lend themselves to a niche marketing approach (<10,000 plastic surgeons and aesthetic dermatologists in the U.S. and Canada). Overall, ScarX estimates the combined market value in the U.S. for these two market segments to be in the range of $2.0 - $2.5 billion USD annually.",Early Stage Venture,2250000,USD,2250000

A large volume of scientific literature has demonstrated the health benefits of green tea and EGCG, however the therapeutic use of EGCG is limited by its poor bioavailability. Viteava’s drug candidates affect important biological pathways targeted by EGCG, while demonstrating enhanced potency and bioavailability in the absence of significant toxicity. Viteava’s strategy leverages clinical data with green tea extracts in patients where biological responses have been observed. The company’s drug candidates are designed to improve these treatment regimens and enhance the biological responses. Viteava is a virtual company with R&D activities in Toronto, Montréal and Detroit. It hopes to bring its first drug candidate to the clinic before the end of 2015. The company’s unique technology platform is based on a rationally-designed library of novel compounds derived from EGCG. A large volume of scientific literature has demonstrated the efficacy of EGCG and green tea extracts in animal and human studies of direct relevance to cancer prevention and treatment strategies.

There are almost 10,000 known rare diseases that together affect about 8%-10% of the population of North America and Europe. Eighty percent of rare diseases have an identified genetic basis, and for most of those, limited gene mutations appear to be responsible. To make the situation more dire, one-half of all rare diseases primarily affect children. Unfortunately, less than 40% of rare diseases have formal support and research organizations to speak for them. Besides, obtaining financial support for most rare disease research remains a daunting challenge. At 123Genetix, we believe that rare should not mean forgotten. To empower global rare diseases research, we have created a growing online library of artificial intelligence (AI) based simulations of rare diseases, including rare cancers. These models are customizable by the investigator and have several critical applications. They are designed for hypothesis generation, research and experimental planning, grant writing and novel targeted drug discovery. At present, only 5% of rare diseases have FDA approved therapies. We passionately believe that there is an enormous unmet medical need, and the time is right for us to transform rare and other diseases (like COVID-19) research and the lives of affected families. We are currently in the process of moving our technology and company to the next level with the help of IBM. 123Genetix is part of the IBM-!3 incubator and IBM is assisting us with the migration of our DeepNEU platform to the IBM cloud.
