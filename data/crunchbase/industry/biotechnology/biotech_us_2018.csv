Mitochondria are at the heart of complex life's origin. Likely a bacterium at the time, the would-be-organelle merged with a simple organism, entering into a symbiotic relationship: The mitochondria began supplying the energy for elaborate cellular functions to evolve, while the organism provided the mitochondria with an environment to thrive. Today, mitochondria are found in all human cells, except for red blood cells. They take on a pivotal role in cellular fate, as they produce most of the energy (ATP) and are involved in a large number of cellular and metabolic processes. The density of the organelles is particularly high in cells requiring a lot of cellular energy - e.g. cardiomyocytes or brain cells. Mitochondria function, and hence energy supply to the cell, may be impaired due to acute insults (e.g. ischemia) or genetic disorders (e.g. LOHN). Researchers at Harvard University developed an approach for mitochondria augmentation and replacement to ameliorate the damages from ischemia-reperfusion injury.  Ischemia is a lack of blood flow leading to an undersupply of oxygen and an impairment of mitochondria function. Reperfusion describes the re-introduction of blood flow, inducing an oversupply of oxygen. Both, ischemia and reperfusion, damage cells, with the mitochondria dysfunction being at the heart of the injury. The cascade of events, from ischemia to reperfusion, will eventually lead to cell death. The most prominent acute conditions associated with ischemia-reperfusion injury are heart attacks. At Cellvie, we are developing a means to transplant viable mitochondria into the compromised cells, to interrupt the said cascade of events, re-enabling the cells to turn oxygen into energy via the mitochondria.",Seed,10500000,USD,10500000

We uniquely address the largest unmet need in CSF Management; the high rate of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt occlusion. VP shunts fail at a rate of 50% within 2 years and 80% within 5 years, contributing to repeat revision brain surgeries (each costing upwards of $40,000).  Conceptualized in 2014 in collaboration with Boston Children’s Hospital and spun out of Alcyone Therapeutics in 2018, Anuncia’s patented portfolio of technologies provide peace-of-mind through innovation to improve daily quality of life for the millions of underserved patients with hydrocephalus and other CSF disorders and their families, who suffer from the clinical, economic, and emotional burden of repeat revision brain surgery due to VP shunt occlusions. Anuncia’s core platform has an elegant mechanism of action using a simple finger depression of a soft silicone dome located under the patient’s scalp to produce a noninvasive, retrograde flush of the patient’s own CSF to restore flow through an occluded catheter and prevent emergency surgery. ReFlow’s initial clinical evidence of flow restoration and reduction of symptoms via acute intervention flushing with follow-up up to 3 years, led neurosurgeons to evaluate ReFlow for prophylactic occlusion prevention in their high-risk patients. Ground-breaking clinical data, now out up to 2 years with 100% success, suggest ReFlow is safe for at-home, prophylactic flushing by patients or caregivers to extend shunt life and eliminate revision brain surgery. Supported by these encouraging results, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted ReFlow Breakthrough Device status in 2021, making it eligible for regulatory and reimbursement advantages. With existing profitable reimbursement, Anuncia plans to launch its next-generation ReFlow Mini product line in Q2 2022 and continue clinical studies to support market adoption and premium reimbursement.  With Breakthrough status and strong health economic advantages to improve hospital quality metrics and support New Technology Add-on Payment (NTAP) for rapid market adoption and premium pricing; Anuncia is positioned to be the leader in CSF management and help patients live fuller lives.  ReFlow’s unique ability to improve patient access to noninvasive lifesaving therapy at home or in the clinic and to improve clinical outcomes and quality of life, and reduce healthcare costs, earned it an Honorable Mention in the Fast Company 2021 World-Changing Ideas Awards and landed it on MDDI’s The Ultimate List of Private Companies to Watch.",Seed,1000,USD,1000
