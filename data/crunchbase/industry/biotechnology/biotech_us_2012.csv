In 2018, the game-changing Farm Bill laid the groundwork for the explosion in popularity of CBD and Delta-8. Though a few states have banned Delta-8, most have not.  Delta-8 produces similar, yet milder, effects to “regular” THC (Delta-9), the main psychoactive compound in cannabis. With Delta-8, many people report more of a “body buzz,” and less head rush and anxiety that can sometimes come with traditional THC.

Within all tumors there exists a diverse mix of immune cells. In particular their company is interested in T cells and their function within tumor-bearing hosts.  Some of these T cells are responding to new or overly expressed antigens that a tumor produces and are capable of destroying the tumor.  Others are actively shutting down the immune response to protect healthy tissue.  This dynamic and complex relationship is ongoing in the tumor microenvironment and is unique relative to blood.  For this reason we are in the process of identifying new immunotherapy targets by understanding the complexity of human tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) isolated from several different tumor types.  Through our close alignment with the Earl A Chiles Research Institute at the Providence Cancer Center we have evaluated over a hundred tumor specimens obtained from surgery.  We process these samples as soon as they are obtained from the operating room in order to keep the immune phenotypes intact, which avoids changes that can occur during freezing or resting.  Differences in RNA array data have identified genes that are upregulated in either the activating and suppressive immune populations within the tumor microenvironment.  From this information they design and develop recombinant proteins, antibodies, or small molecules that block and/or activate novel immune-specific pathways.  These agents are currently being tested in a battery of immune-specific in-vitro human assays and in mouse tumor models with the ultimate goal of treating cancer patients.

The Redoxagens are designed to hack into redox-mediated mitochondrial signaling pathways to turn on cellular self-repair mechanisms. They differ from the regular drugs: instead of targeting a single xenobiotic mechanism, Redoxagens induce multitude of redox-mediated cellular self-repair signaling pathways in normal cells and cell death in cells with high reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels/severe oxidative stress (i.e. cancerous). ROS and mitochondrial substrates potentiate Redoxagens - making their action specific to redox sites of electron transport chain (ETC) inside mitochondria and plasma membrane redox system (PMRS) and cells with elevated ROS levels. Once they reach the redox process/ROS-rich environment Redoxagen API, Geroxane, is consumed producing ROS-burst after which redox activity returns to normal = no chronic toxicity. This results in a dual mode of action:  a) in normal cells where redox activity is confined to mitochondria, activation of  Redoxagens is triggered at PMRS or at ETC sites inside mitochondria and induces on redox-mediated mitochondrial and cellular self-repair signaling pathways b) in cancerous cells where energy production/redox activity is localized to the cytosol or in cells with severe oxidative stress where ROS concentration in cytosol is already high, activation of Redoxagens results in ROS burst in cytosol, which brings ROS concentration to toxic levels and triggers on cell death. Redoxagens have been tested in over 300 humans and over 8,000 horses against numerous diseases with profound success and without serious adverse events. Our principal focus is development of treatments for the Dry form of Age-related Macular Degeneration.
