They receive remote updates on almost all information critical to their lives and lifestyle, and they have the ability to monitor event status and to predict and plan for change. Yet in the medical field, a physician treating a progressive disease often has no choice but to be reactive -- often with harmful results. Critical data on patient disease state is collected infrequently during sporadic office visits, yielding only a single data point to interpret past trends and assess long-term risk. Unlike their personal updates, continously available via sensors, GIS, and smart phone connectivity, there is no continuous stream of physiological measurement data from patients that can allow physicians to track and anticipate changes in disease status. The medical team cannot see how patient activity may be affecting disease indicators, and they can't see whether patients are even complying with drug therapy. The end result? More patient visits to the ER and doctor's office -- often when physiological damage has already been done. Injectsense: A New Paradigm for Therapy Management Injectsense enables tracking of progressive disease indicators and improved therapy management by providing continuous, clinically actionable information through an injectable ultra-miniature sensor coupled with a secure digital health platform. Their sensor, which can be delivered during a doctor's office visit, transforms the care model by enabling medical teams to track the disease at the pace of its evolution, whether months or years, receive early warning signs and provide preventive therapy. The configurable-on-demand sensor monitors patients 24/7, requires no patient lifestyle changes and reduces the need for medical office visits. More significantly, it allows physicians to establish an individual patient baseline for comparison, to receive data quickly at any time of day, to see histories and hourly dynamic disease state before irreversible damage is done, and to increase the effectiveness of drug therapy by tracking the effects of pharmaceuticals on key indicators over time.",Early Stage Venture,17436021,USD,17436021

Increasingly strict global regulations, litigation risks, and industry-wide push for cost reduction has created an urgent need for toxicity evaluations of not just the end-products, but also the starting materials.  By screening out toxic drug targets, avoiding the use of toxic raw material, pharma and biochem companies can avoid many months of wasted R&D time, minimize the toxic waste generation, and avoid costly late-stage manufacturing changes. End result: less time and money needed to bring drug to market. For consumer sectors, by minimizing the use of toxic raw materials and formulations, they can minimize the risk of late-stage manufacturing changes, and increase govt. compliance, and brand recognition. What do we offer?: 1)	Toxicity of less than 0.1% of chemicals is known. Scientists rely on material data-sheets, but 80% of these are either inaccurate or incomplete. We offer toxicity evaluation of all chemicals, including new molecules 2)	Companies are having difficulty in keeping track of worldwide frequently changing government regulations and chemical threshold. We provide up-to-date compliance and chemical threshold information 3)	Within consumer industries, suppliers don’t disclose formulation ingredients (their IP), and they cannot accurately predict toxicity of their formulations, because the models that take into account the % composition of chemicals, and their interactions within mixtures don’t exist.  We are building such models using machine-learning algorithms ensuring increasing accuracy.  By offering accurate toxicity related information throughout R&D, ViridisChem will lead the standardization of toxicity evaluation across all industries Our Solution: We have built the most comprehensive toxicity database with over 90 million chemicals and 2.4 billion properties, curated using AI techniques, and are offering through yearly subscription, an AI powered SaaS software platform that provides toxicity evaluation (related to ecological, health and safety) of any chemical, even the new molecules, identifies local, regional, and per country regulatory issues and established thresholds related to the chemical use, allowing scientists to eliminate high-risk drug candidates. And minimize the use of toxic raw material. This is the Industry-first off-the-shelf toxicity evaluation product offering real-time toxicity evaluation of any chemical, even the new molecules. This much needed solution is proving to be so powerful, that ViridisChem received recognition by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) for offering solutions that will most benefit sustainability.

There has always been a critical shortage of blood worldwide; as the population grows & ages, that shortage will grow. Many people outside of the US are told at the hospital to get friends & family to donate blood but it often arrives too late, and there is no inventory on hand.  Perftoran (to be rebranded as Vidaphor, meaning life-bearing) is completely artificial; it is not hemoglobin based. It does not need to be matched to blood type, saving time & resources; its use virtually eliminates the risk of viral transmission (not all countries screen donors to the extent that we do in the US) and unlike blood, which expires in 4-6 weeks, the shelf life of Perftoran is 3-5 years when stored frozen; adverse reactions, some of which are very serious and can result in lengthy hospital stays and even death can occur following a blood transfusion, while there have been very few serious reactions reported after more than 30,000 exposures.  The majority of recipients of Perftoran (88%) have had very good results; mild to moderate adverse reactions have occurred in 4% of recipients, the majority of which have been transfusion reactions (flu-like symptoms, flushing).  Our first market is Mexico, where we will relaunch the rebranded product; thereafter, we will expand throughout Latin America under mutual recognition agreements with Mexico.

LMI-Vet is positioned to enter the stable, growing, multi-billion dollar veterinary market with a new, break-through critical care product, which satisfies a major market gap for companion animals. Like human medicine, the need for a non-toxic Fluid Replacement for dehydration and severe bleeding is considered the holy grail for emergency medicine. Previously, Oxyglobin®, a bovine hemoglobin product, confirmed the need for a veterinary blood substitute, which product is no longer available in the US. Currently, US veterinarians must resort to blood products to satisfy their fluid replacement needs, which have limited shelf life, supply issues, cross-matching requirements, and other market factors, which maintain a need for Dexsome 510 which enhances tissue oxygenation, electrolyte balance,and supplies nutrients. Certain hetastarch products are under scrutiny in the US and banned in Europe, which may create additional demand for dextran based IV solutions. DEXSOME 510 is a new, dextran-based crystalloid, colloid intravenous solution which proposes to become the gold standard for replacement fluids. LMI-Vet Solution will be sold as a replacement fluid, without drug claims, applied to the product. The current competition is threefold, being existing replacement fluids, blood products (whole blood, packed red cells), and Oxyglobin®, which has a controlled  reintroduction in Europe, with a pending re-introduction into the US market by 2015. The key differentiators for LMI-Vet Solution will be easier handling, universal use, reduced cost, and superior safety profile. The differentiating features of LMI-Vet will be established using emerging marketing tactics.",,,USD,
