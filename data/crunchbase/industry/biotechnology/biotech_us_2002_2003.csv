Their proprietary technology for engineering these versatile proteins creates an opportunity to rapidly generate highly differentiated medicines. Adnexus, a Bristol-Myers Squibb R&D Company, is a leader in the discovery and development of Adnectins, a proprietary type of targeted biologic. Adnectins are proteins designed to either block or stimulate therapeutic targets of interest to help fight diseases across a broad range of therapeutic areas. Our proprietary technology for engineering these proteins creates an opportunity to rapidly generate compounds for study as potential treatment options for patients. Targeted biologics are one of the most medically important and fastest growing areas in the biopharmaceutical industry. These drugs are specifically designed to attack targets of disease. Despite the success of the first generation targeted therapeutic products, such as antibodies, additional innovations are sought by the medical community to help meet unmet needs for improved safety, and efficacy. We believe the study of Adnectins can help to address these demands. Adnectins are derived from human fibronectin, an abundant extracellular protein that binds naturally to a number of different proteins. We create Adnectins using our proprietary protein engineering system called PROfusion™. Our scientists can rapidly create PROfusion libraries of more than 10 trillion different Adnectins. We then screen these libraries to identify Adnectins with the desired drug properties against therapeutic targets of interest. PROfusion enables discovery productivity by minimizing the timeframe for identifying high-quality candidates. In October 2007, Adnexus was acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. This acquisition has further accelerated our growth as an industry leader in the discovery and early development of proprietary targeted biologics.

The company’s business is focused on the development of novel chemistry and genetic engineering methodologies for the modification of cyclic peptide-based compounds. Historically, structural modifications required to convert a native cyclic peptide into a functional drug often involved complicated and expensive synthetic chemistry approaches. This hampered the development of many promising drug candidates. It also prevented optimization (such as reduction of side effects) of many existing drugs. AureoGen is taking advantage of recent advances in medicinal chemistry to develop novel approaches that allow efficient, cost-effective modification, optimization, and production of cyclic peptide compounds. AureoGen’s chemistries allow many modifications (to cyclic peptides) to be introduced directly, without the need for the multiple synthesis steps, disassembly of the core ring structure, and re-synthesis of large portions of the molecule, that characterized older approaches. Similarly, advances in biology and genetics have produced tools and knowledge that allow efficient structural modification of cyclic peptides by (genetic) engineering of the non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) complexes responsible for their synthesis in the producer organisms. Thus, using state-of-the-art chemical and genetic engineering methodologies, AureoGen is producing novel cyclic peptide-based drug candidates that are new chemical entities (NCEs) and that have the pharmacological properties required for development into useful therapeutics. AureoGen’s methodologies allow for the efficient and cost-effective in-depth exploration of the pharmacological properties (structure activity relationships, SAR) of virtually any cyclic peptide, as well as simple and economical generation of entirely novel cyclic peptides.",,,,

Possessing protein structure information empowers researchers to conduct ‘structure-based drug discovery. Protein crystallography is the science of determining the structures of therapeutically relevant proteins at the atomic scale, the most basic level of our biological make-up. There are approximately 100,000 different proteins in the human body. They are the building blocks of life and play critical roles in our biology by doing the body’s work. Since proteins are what drugs target, being able to see them and how a drug interacts with them structurally enables researchers to use a computer-aided, structure-based approach to design and build better drugs that bind more tightly into a protein’s active site like a ‘key into a lock’.",,,,
