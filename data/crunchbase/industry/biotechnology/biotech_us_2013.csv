Loxo Oncology derives its company name from an attendant of the Greek goddess Artemis, who represented the concept of trajectory in the sport of archery. It is an exciting time to develop cancer drugs. Diagnostic methods are yielding strong clues about which cancer features are actionable, “driver mutations,” in contrast to those merely along for the ride as “passenger mutations.” In the last five years, these insights have transformed the standard of care in melanoma, lung cancer and other cancers. Picking a target is just the first step in building a cancer drug. Good chemists build good drugs. The physical properties of a compound have much to do with its ultimate success or failure. Is it stable? Is it soluble? Is it absorbed? Does it reach its target? Does it engage the target? Does it cause toxicity elsewhere in the body before it achieves maximum efficacy in the cancer? In our opinion, drugs that achieve excellent exposure in the body and are highly specific for their intended targets have the highest chances of success. Once an attractive target is selected and a drug with best-in-class properties is constructed, setting up the right clinical development plan is of utmost importance. Our goal is to generate a clinical path that reflects the underlying scientific hypothesis that made the drug interesting in the first place. This often means developing the drug in a population of patients whose tumors possess a specific genetic vulnerability targeted by the drug. Loxo Oncology was built around a team of full-time professionals and engaged scientific advisors who are aligned in choosing the most actionable targets, and pursuing them through disciplined clinical trial approaches.

Providing a method for rapid processing of sexual assault evidence, their Next Generation Differential Extraction (NGDE™) system will enable significant reductions in casework backlogs. More than 840,000 cases annually worldwide involve sexual assault. Evidence processing requires separation of the victim’s cells (epithelial) from the perpetrator’s cells (sperm) and requires time-consuming selective cell lysis, centrifugation and separation into female and male DNA fractions (a process known as differential extraction). Differential extraction has been identified by the USDOJ as a major bottleneck in processing sexual assault samples. Currently, differential extraction involves a labor-intensive 6 to 8 hour process.

They are thought to be the earliest sign of solid tumors, and they can be detected in a simple blood sample. CTCs reflect the current state of all cancer sites and offer a thorough prognostic insight into a patient’s cancer. The capture and characterization of CTCs from blood promises to guide the use of highly targeted therapies – i.e., “personalized” medical treatment – and to enable much earlier detection of primary cancer.      Current CTC equipment is slow, expensive, offered as an outsourced service, and is not sufficiently sensitive to provide useful data. Only one CTC instrument is currently FDA approved, and it suffers limited use and a poor reputation because it takes over 4 hours, misses entire classes of CTCs, and does limited cellular characterization.     AxonDx’s nCYTE™ technology scans un-enriched blood samples in minutes, finds all classes of CTCs shed by solid tumors, and offers morphological and outsourced molecular characterization of positive cells. The nCYTE™ approach is fast, vastly more accurate, compact, easy to adopt, and cost effective enough to be offered at the point of care. Collectively, the nCYTE™ advances represent new era, game-changing improvements over all existing CTC detection technologies.

Biopharmaceuticals are much larger and more fragile than traditional small-molecule drugs. Due to their size, large doses of biologics are often required; and because of their fragility, these drugs must be administered by injection instead of orally. Biologics become unstable and extremely viscous at the high concentrations required for traditional low-volume injections. Consequently, they are frequently administered as high-volume, slow intravenous infusions in a hospital setting. From a patient perspective, receiving treatment via subcutaneous administration can be preferable to intravenous infusion. Subcutaneous administration removes the need for invasive IV ports. Administration at home eliminates time-intensive and expensive hospital visits. Achieving high doses of biologics in a volume suitable for subcutaneous administration presents significant formulation challenges. The major limiting factor is viscosity, which arises when biomolecules are formulated at high concentration.  Arsia’s mission is to produce high-concentration biopharmaceutical products with low viscosity, suitable for small-volume subcutaneous injection. Our proprietary platform technology reduces the viscosity of biologics through the addition of inactive ingredients (excipients). Because Arsia’s technology works at the formulation stage, the molecular structure of the drug itself is not affected. Arsia’s technology provides i) a formulation solution for new products in development that have viscosity challenges, ii) a life-cycle management strategy for existing products and iii) a way to differentiate those products from others on the market.
