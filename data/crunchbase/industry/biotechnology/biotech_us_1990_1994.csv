Titan’s principal asset is Probuphine®, the first slow-release implant formulation of buprenorphine hydrochloride (“buprenorphine”), designed to maintain a stable, round-the-clock blood level of the medicine in patients for up to six months following a single treatment. The outpatient treatment of opioid dependence with daily dosed sublingual buprenorphine formulations represents a $1.3 billion market in the U.S., and a seven day transdermal patch formulation of buprenorphine for the treatment of chronic pain was launched in the U.S. in 2011. This novel implant formulation is inserted subdermally in a patient’s upper arm providing continuous medication, and has the potential to enhance patient compliance to treatment, and limit diversion for illicit use and accidental exposure to the sublingual formulations. The New Drug Application (NDA) was submitted to the FDA in October, 2012 seeking approval for treatment of opioid dependence. In December 2012, Titan entered into a license agreement with Braeburn Pharmaceuticals Sprl (“Braeburn”) that grants Braeburn exclusive commercialization rights to Probuphine® in the United States and Canada. Titan received a non-refundable up-front license fee of $15.75 million and will receive a $50 million milestone payment upon the approval of the NDA by the FDA. Additionally, Titan will be eligible to receive up to $130 million upon achievement of specified sales milestones and up to $35 million in regulatory milestones in the event of future NDA submissions and approvals for additional indications, including chronic pain. Titan will receive tiered royalties on net sales of Probuphine ranging from the mid-teens to the low twenties. Probuphine is the first product to utilize ProNeura™, a novel, proprietary, long-term drug delivery technology.

Finally, Titan is also entitled to royalty revenue of 8-10% of net sales of Fanapt® (iloperidone), an atypical antipsychotic compound being marketed in the U.S. for the treatment of schizophrenia by Novartis Pharma AG (“Novartis”) under a sub-license agreement based on a licensed U.S. patent that expires in October 2016 (does not include a possible six month pediatric extension).

The company also has a broad pipeline of vaccines in early clinical development for treatment of other major cancers, including breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma and other solid tumors. Therion's partners include Aventis Pasteur, the National Cancer Institute and a network of leading clinical institutions around the world. Therion is a privately-held biotechnology company headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Therion's goal is to generate safe and effective therapeutic cancer vaccines that stimulate the immune system to specifically attack cancer cells, and thereby stabilize disease or induce tumor regression, improve patients' quality of life, and increase patient survival. While there has been significant progress in the treatment of some cancers, the prognosis for many cancer patients remains poor. For example, colorectal cancer affects an estimated 130,000 new patients and accounts for 56,300 deaths each year in the United States. Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men, with an estimated 180,400 new cases and 31,900 deaths in the U.S. annually. Recent advances in immunology and tumor biology have opened the door for the development of new generation therapeutic cancer vaccines. In particular, scientists now have a better understanding of the key molecular signals involved in eliciting potent and specific immune responses. This allows researchers to engineer vaccines that induce elements of the immune system required to eliminate cancer cells. Therion is at the forefront, quickly moving leading research into clinical development. Capitalizing on these recent scientific advances, Therion is targeting many of the major cancers currently lacking adequate treatment.
