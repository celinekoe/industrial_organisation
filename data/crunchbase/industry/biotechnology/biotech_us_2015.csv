Intrommune’s therapies are delivered through a platform that integrates simply into a person’s daily routine to enable them and their loved ones to live their lives without fear. The Company’s Oral Mucosal Immunotherapy (OMIT) platform is based on the well-accepted principles of immunotherapy. OMIT utilizes a specially formulated toothpaste that optimizes exposure of allergenic proteins to a patient’s immune system, while cleaning their teeth. The initial product in development is INT301 for the treatment of peanut allergy. The lack of treatments makes food allergies an area of tremendous unmet need. The FDA has only approved one product for any food allergy, a peanut allergy immunotherapy that requires you to ingest peanut protein. As desperate as patients are for solutions, due to significant adverse events and difficulty in administration, only 1 in 10 eligible patients are willing to ingest peanut protein. Nonetheless, the company was recently acquired for $2.6 billion. With minimal options, patients and caregivers must resort to attempting to avoid allergy-triggering foods in the often-futile hope of preventing severe allergic reactions. In short, patients, parents, providers and payors are all seeking a safe, efficacious, and easy to administer product such as INT301.

The company is leveraging its DIMERx™ technology to address the problem of visceral hypersensitivity and pancreatitis in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders and the unmet medical needs in the treatment of both peripheral neuropathic and systemic nociceptive pain. The lead candidate ORP-101 is a peripherally acting sodium ion channel blocker (Nav 1.7), mu agonist/kappa antagonist dimer. The molecule does not cross the blood brain barrier and, unlike other opioids that constrict the sphincter of Oddi, ORP-101, when given intravenously in animal studies, has instead been shown to relax the sphincter. The former attribute implies no abuse potential and the latter minimizes the risks of pancreatitis and/or abdominal pain related to sphincter of Oddi constriction. These two attributes, in combination with the well-understood pharmacology of ORP-101, make the molecule a suitable candidate for chronic treatment of conditions associated with visceral and somatic hypersensitivity and hyperalgesia. Therefore we have positioned ORP-101 for two non-overlapping indications: the oral form for colonic hyperalgesia and gastric dysmotility in IBS-D and the parenteral form for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain. The potential clinical benefits are backed by compelling data from validated animal models. The company is also developing potent non-opioid and opioid conjugates to treat acute and chronic nociceptive pain. The non-opioid analgesic conjugate is designed to be non-ulcerogenic and liver-safe and, therefore, has the potential to reshape the pain market served by acetaminophen and NSAIDs. Similarly, the opioid conjugate is designed to be orally active and have a lower potential for dependence than currently available opioids. DIMERx™ technology results in conjugates designed to preserve the receptor pharmacology of their individual constituents, but to have therapeutic profiles well suited for different clinical indications. The components of the conjugates have all been previously proven to be safe and effective for other indications and, therefore, the conjugates have reduced developmental risks. The DIMERx™ conjugates are considered to be new molecular entities and have composition of matter intellectual property protection.",Early Stage Venture,41816012,USD,41816012

Possible lead indications for which there are proof of concept data: Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer’s and/or Parkinson’s Disease, Central Nervous System Injuries, and Seizure Disorders. There is very limited industry progress for the above indications. The current treatments for MS relapse are by injection with no long term benefit for neurodegeneration and disability and highly variable safety profiles. No combined anti-inflammatory or aggregate disposal therapies are presently available for neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, or Huntington’s diseases. CHECs are unique because they target all the principal cellular pathologies in degenerative diseases (inflammation, cell death, protein aggregation) in an orally available formulation.    Company advisors are Timothy Cunningham, Ph.D., who discovered and isolated the compounds, and Jeffrey Greenstein, M.D., who is a neurologist/immunologist that will supervise clinical applications. The peptides are protected by issued US patents and several patent applications.     CHEC PR takes a flexible position for selection of initial lead indication and for equity sharing. Accommodating investor interest and needs in this way is expected to expedite capitalization and clinical development,     Key Milestones:  - Selection of lead indication - IND enablement thru Phase I    Summary: CHEC PR has a highly qualified team of advisors that have developed these novel peptide therapeutics with potential is in several multi-billion dollar markets.
