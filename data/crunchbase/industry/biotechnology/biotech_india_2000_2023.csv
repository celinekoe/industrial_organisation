Healthcare is one of the largest sectors in India, handled by both public and private players generating a major share of revenue as well as employment opportunities in the country. When it comes to economics of healthcare, a lot of uncertainty is encountered as majority expenditure is still handled in an out-of- pocket fashion in private centers as opposed to insurance which is more popular in the western world. What complicates this business is the compulsive need for presence of moral and ethical values in every aspect along with presenting affordable and quality services. When it comes to diagnostic services and handling the burden many primary healthcare centers routinely face, the need for rapid and precise testing can ease many aspects of diagnosing the condition, management and also follow-up schedules. These roadblocks have become manageable to a certain extent with the introduction of IT and the digitization of healthcare services in India.

In addition to causing premature deaths, NCDs also impede the quality of life of people. NCDs are a threat not only to human health, but also to economic development and growth. NCDs account for an annual loss of 5-10% of GDP in India, leading to a crippling effect on the individual and the economy. Current health care systems, both in the public and private sectors, are heavily oriented towards reactive care and episodic treatment. There is less emphasis on preventive, primary and continuous care that is required to manage long term clinical and behavioral modifications necessary to manage chronic conditions and reduce long term health costs for individuals and health systems.
