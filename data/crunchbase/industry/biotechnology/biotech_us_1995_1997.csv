We actively support and partner with non-profit organizations and other companies dedicated to creating a more equitable world.

Gala’s core proprietary technology is GPEx® (Gene Product Expression), a gene insertion/expression technology that allows rapid creation of stable, high-expressing mammalian cell lines for a wide variety of gene products. ""Gala"" is Greek for milk, and the company's original mission was to produce pharmaceutical proteins in the milk of transgenic cows.

These have been used all over the world for thousands of years for their health benefits. Green tea's metabolism boosting effect is achieved by the inhibiting action of its most active ingredient epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) on the activity of the enzymes that breakdown the neurotransmitter known as norepinephrine making it last longer. The effect of norepinephrine increases the process of thermogenesis - the generation of immense heat in the body. Thermogenesis is mainly considered to increase the body's energy expenditure as well as having a significant effect on body fat oxidation. Green teas have the ability to speed up the body's metabolic rate by up to 4%. This seemingly insignificant boost in metabolism can however with little or no effort than just drinking 2-4 cups daily help to burn stored body fats and reduce fat storage. Over time, this 4% boost in calorie burning can substantially increase an individual's overall fat burning capability. Green tea gives you energy by slowing the usage of carbohydrates in our body, meaning you can exercise much longer without feeling tired. Thus you can burn more calories. Oolong Wu Yi: WuYi tea is a robust flavored, dark brown tea, part of the Oolong Tea family that is found in the mountain regions (Mt. Wu-Yi) of China. Oolong tea is a product made from the buds, leaves and stems of the Camellia sinensis plant. Oolong tea is partially fermented. Wu Yi Tea burns fat faster and increases your metabolism resulting in natural and safe weight loss. Oolong tea is used to sharpen thinking skills and improve mental alertness. It is also used to prevent tooth decay, cancer, heart disease and osteoporosis. Organic Rooibos: Pronounced ""roy-boss"" and means ""red bush"" in Afrikaans. Rooibos is literally red in color. It shows anti-carcinogenic, anti-mutagenic, anti-viral activity and anti-inflammatory. It contains no additives, colorants or preservatives. It contains no substances, which can be harmful to the nervous system, causing high blood pressure, irritability and erratic sleep patterns. It is quite low in tannin, a substance that adversely affects the body’s metabolism by decreasing the absorption of protein and iron. The aromatic, clean flavour of Rooibos can safely be enjoyed in excessive quantities throughout the day, with no harmful side-effects. In fact, it makes a relaxing and soothing evening tea before sleep! Ginger: Ginger is recognized for its excellent medicinal properties for a long time. Ginger contains gingerols & shogoals. These help calm the stomach acid. It also helps in toning the muscles of digestive tract. Ginger root is very beneficial in medicinal uses. It lowers the cholesterol level to a great extent which in turn helps in weight loss. Ginger root aids the metabolism. Ginger actually expands the body's blood vessels while boosting the body's overall heat and temperature. . This process is called a ""thermogenic"" process. As this process takes place, the metabolism of the body is boosted, allowing dieters to shed fat, eradicate consumed foods, and utilize calories more efficiently, quickly and effectively. Ginger can boost the metabolism of our body by up to 20%, thus allowing us to lose weight more efficiently and effectively. Pomegranate: Pomegranate has been declared to be a super fruit bearing a small tree or shrub that grows anywhere between 5 and 8 meters tall. Pomegranate is regarded to be one of the healthiest fruits in the universe, with its vast array of vitamins. Pomegranate not only has quite health benefits but it can also be useful in assisting people with weight loss, just because it is natural and it provides energy to the body. It can help you in your weight loss efforts by preventing arteries hardening, which are caused by a build-up of plaque in the walls of our blood vessels, thus causing high cholesterol. It can lead blood vessels decreased blood flow and damage, which in turn can lead to strokes and heart attacks, which are classic symptoms of being overweight. It can also assist you in lowering LDL cholesterol (the bad cholesterol) and actually raises HDL cholesterol (the good kind). Guarana: The potency of caffeine is attributed to guaranine. This supplement is rather comparable to caffeine. It is well-know as being a great hunger suppressor. The main principle in the usage of guarana for losing weight or detoxing is clear; it will lessen thee desires for food - thus you simply won't overeat. It is quite advisable to take the Guarana supplements before the food given it can lead to a major reduction of caloric intake since very less food is consumed. Guarana is also a diuretic. By taking it, the person urinates more. It may lead to a reduction of weight. It also works by increasing the metabolic rate that in turn causes the burning of more and more calories. Birch: Birch has been used for medicinally for years and years. Birch contains betulinic acid. Used as a diaphoretic, it creates perspiration (in this way cleansing toxins from our body through the skin) and helps to reduce fever and cool the body, making it helpful for easing the discomforts of viral infection symptoms and chronic sinusitis. The bactericides of the bark quite manage to eliminate tuberculosis, pathogens of typhoid fever and diphtheria. Also in internal usage, it is used for easing headaches produced by dizziness, hyperzotomy, allergies and for tonifying the nervous system. One can lose weight easily with this wonderful source. Stevia: This natural herb extract is intended for dietary supplement purposes. Stevia rebaudiana is a natural herb that grows in Asia and South America. It has been used as a natural sweetener for centuries. The leaves of the Stevia plant have a refreshing taste, no glycemic index, no calories, and no carbohydrates! It is 25-30 times sweeter than sugar, and much more healthy! Stevia is a great aid in weight management simply because it contains no calories and reduces your craving for fatty foods and sweets. Hunger sensations are quite lessened when 12 or 15 drops are taken 15 minutes before meals. Stevia actually reset the hunger mechanism in you where the pathway between the stomach and the hypothalamus has become obstructed. If so, Stevia would assist people to feel satiated sooner, thus helping them to eat less. Are you the kind of person who uses a lot of sugar? Do you sprinkle it on cereal? Do you use it to sweeten beverages? Do you use it in baked goods and other sweet treats? If so, there's a great possibility that even partially substituting these kinds of refined sugar calories with calorie-free stevia can make a HUGE difference in your weight.",,,,
