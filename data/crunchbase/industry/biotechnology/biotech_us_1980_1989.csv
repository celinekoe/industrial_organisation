Masimo is best known for its pulse oximetry technology, Masimo Signal Extraction Technology® (SET®) — which today is considered to be modern pulse oximetry. Masimo SET® addresses the limitations of conventional pulse oximetry, such as its poor performance during patient motion or low perfusion. Founder and CEO Joe Kiani was inspired to develop more reliable, accurate technology after observing ineffective pulse oximetry in the neonatal care unit (NICU).  Masimo’s pulse oximetry is at the heart of many of its monitoring devices and products. In 2023, SET®’s origin — as a way to more reliably monitor NICU babies — came full circle with the introduction of Masimo Stork™, a baby monitor that uses SET® and other advanced technologies to help parents track their babies’ health indicators at home. In addition to Masimo SET®, the company has developed numerous noninvasive measurements (collectively known as the rainbow SET® family of measurements), a suite of advanced devices like the Root® patient monitoring and connectivity platform, many other innovative bedside, handheld, and tetherless devices, and remote patient monitoring and management solutions like Masimo Patient SafetyNet™ and Masimo SafetyNet  These devices and solutions help caregivers monitor numerous physiological parameters including blood oxygen saturation (SET® SpO2), total hemoglobin (SpHb®) carboxyhemoglobin (SpCO®), fluid responsiveness (PVi®), methemoglobin (SpMet), respiration rate from the pleth (RRp®), brain function while sedated (SedLine®), regional and cerebral oximetry (O3®), cardiac output (LiDCO™), end-tidal carbon dioxide and other capnography measurements (NomoLine®), acoustic respiratory rate (RRa®), and more.  Masimo also develops therapeutic products like Masimo softFlow™ which delivers respiratory support to patients with spontaneous breathing. Additionally, Bridge™ by Masimo is a non-drug device that alleviates symptoms of opioid withdrawal through neuromodulation — making recovery safer and easier. Masimo also offers the first FDA-authorized device to alert users in the event of an opioid overdose, Opioid Halo™, and wearable devices like the Masimo W1™ advanced health tracking watch.

In order to better understand how these are useful, you'll have to know a bit about DNA itself.  DNA is ""the blueprint for life"" and encodes instructions for all of life's processes. DNA is a complex long thin molecule (strand) that is made from 4 possible building blocks called ""bases"". These bases are called Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine and Thymine, and the precise order of these bases is a code for information. In living organisms, DNA strands can be millions of bases long and therefore contain huge amounts of information. This complexity is responsible for the vast complexity and diversity of life on earth.  The way that one strand of DNA specifically binds a second strand of DNA allows scientists to use short DNA strands (oligos) as research tools. A short synthetic piece of DNA (usually around 20 bases long) can be used to bind or find its matching sequence even in a complex mixture of millions of unrelated pieces of DNA. It is this unique fact that allows researchers to decode and study the genetic makeup of any living organism.  Using new oligo-based technologies, a revolution is underway where they are beginning to catalog the complete genetic makeup of hundreds of living things, ranging from bacteria to humans. The human genome alone contains over 3 billion bases of DNA, so projects of this kind tend to be very complex and often take years to complete.  Scientists often start the research knowing the DNA sequence for the organism that they are interested in studying. Given a known DNA sequence, they can easily design a short oligo that can be used to perform a variety of tasks. It is this short single-stranded DNA that the researcher orders from IDT. Living systems don't discriminate DNA that is synthesized chemically from DNA taken directly from an organism, allowing researchers to use IDT's custom made oligonucleotides as if they had existed naturally.  IDT manufactures the oligo using chemical DNA synthesis machines designed and built in-house. They've refined the process to the point where they can receive an order as late as 1:00pm and have the desired oligo in the researcher's hands the next morning. Their customers range from small university labs of only a few scientists to global pharmaceutical companies, and everything in between.",M&A,,USD,

Stephenson following the death of his mother, Mary Brown Stephenson. After being diagnosed with lung cancer in the 1970s, Richard and his mother quickly began to research treatment opportunities. They sought alternative remedies and care options relating to diet, exercise and spirituality. Mary's choices were limited. Few institutions appeared to understand, let alone value, the vital connection between one's physical health and their psychological well being. Mary passed away in 1982. While mourning, the bereaved Richard promised to forever alter the course of cancer treatment in America. Stephenson graduated from Wabash College in 1962 and earned his J.D. degree from Northwestern University. While studying at Northwestern, Stephenson founded the International Capital Investment Company (ICIC). In 1975, a Zion, Illinois, hospital was sold to Capitol Investment Company, and soon after the sale, Richard assumed the role of Chairman of the Board. After his mother's passing, Richard started the process to develop the hospital into the nation's preeminent cancer treatment center.  The facility reopened in 1988 as the American International Hospital and became the first cancer treatment center to implement and apply the Mother Standard care model, a patient-centered approach designed to provide those afflicted with cancer the same level of care that a mother would give her child. The Mother Standard system provided patients with traditional oncology treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, as well as alternative and emerging care options such as immunotherapy, hyperthermia, tumor biology and nutrition.These supportive therapies were designed to manage the side effects from intensive treatments like chemotherapy and radiation, and to enhance patients' quality of life.  Striving to enhance patients' quality of life, CTCA provided unorthodox care methods such as aromatherapy, detoxification, hydrotherapy, massage, naturopathy, acupuncture psycho-social intervention, spiritual support and even humor therapy. Set on empowering cancer patients and their loved ones with hope-fulfilling options for care, Stephenson declared, ""I never wanted to see another cancer patient suffer the agony of living without hope."" Constructed in 1958, the American International Hospital thrived throughout the 1980s, and CTCA opened their second hospital in 1990, the year prior, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, as part of the city's City of Faith hospital.  In June 1991, the Illinois Health Facilities Planning Board approved a certificate of need by a unanimous vote. The Zion City Council approved $20 million in bonds in September that year to finance the hospital's renovation, and the thirty-year-old facilities reopened, new and improved. In 1991, Richard founded the Gateway for Cancer Research and served Chairman. 99 cents of every dollar publicly donated goes to fund clinical trials. To date, the foundation has raised more than $75 million and funded over 140 cutting-edge clinical trials around the world. In keeping with CTCA's unorthodox but results-driven methods, December 1997 saw the establishment of the Cancer Resource Center. Gurnee Mills mall in Gurnee, Illinois became home to the center, a place Richard built to give all people the chance to learn and become educated via up-to-date articles and research materials. The center was located nearby CTCA's flagship hospital, renamed Midwestern Regional Medical Center.  As then-CEO of Midwestern Regional Medical Center Roger Cary explained the center's purpose to the Chicago Tribune in 1997, patients can find what they need ""in surroundings that are comfortable [...] instead of searching from place to place and in medical libraries"". CTCA closed out the 1990s with the opening of the Mary Brown Stephenson Radiation Oncology Center, built in Zion, near the American International Hospital. The new oncology center provided additional outpatient rooms and services and housed state-of-the-art radiation and rehabilitation technologies. In 2005, CTCA Tulsa opened a brand new, renovated hospital. The state-of-the-art facility became the only major hospital dedicated solely to cancer treatments in Oklahoma. CTCA Philadelphia opened their doors within the same year and began treating patients. CTCA opened their largest facility to date, at 210,000 square feet, in Phoenix, Arizona in 2008. The CTCA opened their latest center in 2012. As of 2018, CTCA Phoenix will begin delivering onsite chemotherapy and radiation oncology services at their Outpatient Care Center, located in North Phoenix. Cancer Treatment Centers of America's national network of fully accredited cancer hospitals have earned accreditation and certification from the Joint Commission, the American College of Surgeon's Commission on Cancer, the QOPI Certification Program and the College of American Pathologists (CAP). CTCA is world renowned for their high-quality care and for consistently exceeding patient safety standards from numerous healthcare organizations, such as the Association of Community Cancer Centers and the American College of Radiology. CTCA hospitals in Chicago and Philadelphia have been recognized by the Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy (FACT), a University of Nebraska Medical Center program. Four CTCA hospital locations have received awards from the National Accreditation Program for Breast Centers (NAPBC) for their breast center treatment programs. CTCA's suburban Chicago location has earned Magnet Recognition from the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) for excellence in nursing. All CTCA locations are striving to earn this designation; only 9 percent of hospitals in the U.S. can boast ANCC's Magnet Recognition.",M&A,,,

E&O Laboratories,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/e-o-laboratories,Biotechnology,"Scotland, Indiana, United States",E&O Laboratories have been harvesting donor animal blood since 1978 on their two dedicated farm units.,"1,954,387",,Active,1989-01-01,year,,,,,For Profit,https://www.eolabs.com/,"Equine and Ovine Blood Products was a family partnership founded in 1978 with a contract to supply sterile Horse and Sheep blood to Gibco BRL in Paisley. Over the next eleven years the business grew as Gibco secured a high percentage of market share in the UK clinical sector and introduced the first commercially manufactured ready-to-use culture media. In 1989 an American directive determined the sale of the clinical microbiology division of Gibco’s UK operation, which meant that E&O’s donor blood harvesting business had no route to market and required investment and microbiology expertise to go it alone. After six months exposure to political and corporate turmoil, a financial crisis split the family partnership and E&O Laboratories Ltd was launched as an entrepreneurial gamble for the owner Virginia Lucey. Having successfully gained credibility within the clinical sector for sterile animal blood products, E&O diversified its product range to include the manufacture of ready-to-use culture media. This was a major stepping-stone in the company’s growth and offered further opportunities for export into mainland Europe and the Middle East. Over the next five years the company concentrated on increasing sales and developing quality systems in line with business needs. E&O were recognised as Investors in People, gained BS EN.ISO9002:1994 accreditation and increased the staffing level to over 50 employees. Following the millennium celebrations E&O’s strategic team planned further business diversification into the food and industrial sectors. Following the acquisition of a local food testing business, and relocation to Burnhouse, E&O Diagnostics Ltd was launched as a UKAS accredited analytical laboratory servicing the food, industrial and developing environmental business sectors. This service was further enhanced in 2004 with the addition of a chemical division. Further product diversification into the Industrial and Pharmaceutical market followed the successful acquisition of the assets of Fred Baker / Biotrace International’s operation in Runcorn in early 2008.  After four years of continual growth in the ready-to-use media market E&O’s directors recognised the importance of quality raw material supply and decided to close the Food Testing business and concentrate on Dehydrated Culture Media formulations. In 2012 E&O Diagnostics opened a new R&D department and recruited a highly qualified Technical team who were tasked to develop a wide range of DCM and related supplements/reagents. With the Burnhouse manufacturing facility approaching its full capacity, productivity was going to be compromised and new accommodation had to be sourced. After several months of searching, a suitable empty double industrial unit became available in a central location close to the main transport network and our head office. In 2013 the Westfield unit was purchased and over the next 4 years the two units were transformed into a modern cGMP state of the art manufacturing/warehouse/logistics facility. Further investment was made during 2015/16 with the acquisition of the Media for Mycobacteria business (MFM) and, following the relocation from Cardiff to Burnhouse, E&O became the leading supplier of Media/Reagents for Mycobacteria in the UK. With ever increasing demands for Horse and Sheep blood both for inhouse manufacture of plates and export enquires, the directors took the opportunity of investing in a local farm to facilitate the demand. In 2017 all the Donor animal blood harvest operation was moved to South Mains and a new blood processing laboratory was opened on site. With the Westfield facility also going live in 2017, it was a busy year and the management team were stretched to the maximum. Both projects were successful and E&O went on to launch their new extensive Dehydrated Culture Media and Supplement product range targeting export opportunities.  E&O currently employ over 100 highly motivated professional staff. The team will continue to grow organically, with further investment and diversification into new and developing markets. Our culture is led by innovation, encompassing the highest family values with professional business practice at all times.",,,,
