STALICLA’s unique approach addresses a principal weakness in the drug development process for NDD’s and neuropsychiatric disorders: behavior is a terrible biomarker. Clinical psychiatric and neurodevelopmental diagnoses encompass a broad diversity of underlying biology. This has contributed to drug development failure by diluting true responders in a population of patients with heterogeneous biology. STALICLA’s technology platform, DEPI, discovers biologically based endophenotypes within classical neuropsychiatric diagnostic groups. The AI/ML engine converges molecular data with human genetic information and non-behavioral clinical signs and symptoms, to define biologically related subgroups and create testable clinical hypotheses related to that biology. The DEPI platform has already completed several successful clinical validations, through the identification and biological validation of two distinct subgroups of patients with Autism Spectrum Disorder, ASD-Phenotype1 and ASD-Phenotype2, together with their predicted tailored treatment candidates (STP1 and STP2); as well as the blindly and retrospective calling “high” responder patients to previously failed drug candidates with high specificity, sensitivity, and positive predictive value.

The appearance of deposits of the microtubule-associated tau protein as e.g. neurofibrillary tangles in neurons of the brain is a common feature of tauopathies that is shared with Alzheimer’s disease. Neuronal tau deposits are known to be a major contributor to neurodegeneration and mutations in the tau gene are causative of the tauopathy fronto-temporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). Due to increasing life expectancy, Alzheimer’s disease is viewed as one of the largest healthcare problems of this century, imposing a major economic burden on societies in the Western and developing world.

It results from a blockage in the lymphatic system, which is part of the immune system. The blockage prevents the lymphatic system from draining excess fluids, and the fluid buildup leads to swelling, infections, and pain. Unfortunately, there is no cure for lymphedema.

The company intends to develop its compounds through clinical proof of concept and the identification of an expedited registration strategy, after which pharmaceutical partners will be sought to fund pivotal trials and handle commercialization. Oncoethix founders have an unsurpassed track record in identifying and bringing oncology leads to global markets. Dr. Cvitkovic, Chief Scientific Officer for Oncoethix, led the clinical development of single agent and combination regimens for cisplatin, vindesine, bleomycin, navelbine, and, more recently, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, docetaxel, and trabectedin, first as an academic investigator and then through a specialized oncology clinical research organization. Prior to founding Oncoethix and assuming responsibilities as Chief Operating Officer, Dr. Noel had co-founded another oncology drug development company which in-licensed oxaliplatin as its first portfolio product and subsequently identified, evaluated, and in-licensed novel agents for several clients. Additionally, Dr. Noel has developed expedited registration strategies for many cancer drugs and registration files for a few of these. Dr. Herait managed clinical development of irinotecan, from Phase 1 through Phase 3, while at Rhone Poulenc Rorer and subsequently, as a consultant, managed clinical studies for several novel cancer drugs. Since its founding, Oncoethix has in-licensed three promising cancer drug candidates, each a first-in-class agent to a novel target or with a novel mode of action.

In a second step of development, DiagnoSwiss will also merge these two products to develop a global solution for large-scale protein screening in proteomics. DiagnoSwiss’ core technology relies on protein analysis with microfabricated separation methods and affinity assays, and creates high-throughput proteomics platforms in the microtiter-plate format. DiagnoSwiss is filling the gap between high-throughput screening platforms and proteomics for advanced drug discovery. Mass production of low cost polymer micro-chips with specific surface treatment and ultra-fast electrophoretic purification of proteins in free flowing solution are the key elements of DiagnoSwiss’ innovating and proprietary technology. Their approach consists in maintaining the proteins in solution throughout the analysis of native biological samples, thereby increasing the separation rate, facilitating automation and optimising mass spectrometry identification. DiagnoSwiss is currently developing integrated protein analytical systems, that include components for fluid handling and coupling to high resolution detection means and that offer a unique alternative to 2D-gel electrophoresis. DiagnoSwiss’ micro-analytical systems will enable high-througput protein discovery, identification of protein structure and activity, as well as affinity testing (protein-protein, protein-small molecule interactions and immunological assays). Different architectures of miniaturized protein biochips will address the present requirements of proteomics-based drug discovery, and will be extended to the field of medical diagnostics. DiagnoSwiss develops new products and applications directly with its customers, and it aims at becoming a leading provider of instrumentation tools for biomarker discovery, protein assays and characterisation.

They do not simply provide customers with hard- and software but also with thorough support encompassing wide scientific areas where their products can be applied. The number of genetically modified mice created to investigate the neural basis of behavior is rapidly increasing, but most involved laboratories lack the resources to test sufficiently large numbers of mice in conventional behavioral tests. Their automated in-cage testing offers not only the required high throughput and flexibility, but will also remain compatible with increasingly severe governmental regulations on animal experimentation. A particular challenge of toxicological research is to detect discrete and chronic behavioral changes. Long-term in-cage testing offers maximal sensitivity and efficiency in detecting such changes. With their comprehensive hard- and software packages they help their costumers to find the most perfectly adapted solution for their specific needs.",,,,

In 2009, these two groups of conditions comprised up to 25% of the global pharmaceutical market. Advances over the past couple of decades have started to address cardiovascular risk and improve quality of life. Nonetheless, significant residual risk remains, and many products are limited by side effects and/or gradual loss of efficacy. Complicating the situation, patients often suffer from multiple conditions, leaving them with larger and more complicated cocktails of different medications. As such, there are still many unmet medical needs within the cardio-metabolic disease area. Cardiolynx’ builds upon the known targets for pharmaceutical intervention, optimizing and combining well established therapies in novel and more effective ways. The cornerstone of the Cardiolynx’ approach is nitric oxide (NO) which is a multi-functional messenger in the cardiovascular system.
