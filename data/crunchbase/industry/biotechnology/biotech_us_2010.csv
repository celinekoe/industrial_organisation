Once the veins lose their ability to convey blood without reflux, the progressive venous disease cycle has begun. This is commonly referred to as chronic venous insufficiency, or CVI.

In Phase I/II clinical trials of crenolanib combined with intensive chemotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory and newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, composite complete remission has been observed in 68% and 85% of patients, respectively, as evidenced by the reduction in leukemic blasts to less than or equal to 5% in the bone marrow. Based on these results, we have commenced two pivotal Phase III clinical trials of crenolanib in FLT3-mutated AML: one trial in relapsed or refractory patients, and another trial in newly diagnosed patients. Both of these ongoing clinical trials enrolled the first patient in August 2018. In addition to its observed activity in FLT3, in preclinical studies, crenolanib has also been observed to be a highly potent inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor, or PDGF, receptors, and is being evaluated in several solid tumor indications where PDGF pathways are implicated as disease drivers. Given the compelling safety and clinical benefit observed thus far, we believe crenolanib has the potential to become a best-in-class therapeutic for multiple oncology indications. Our vision is to prolong the lives of cancer patients by advancing crenolanib in combination with standard of care chemotherapies as well as emerging therapies that offer the potential for synergistic treatment effects. In certain diseases which currently have no approved treatments, crenolanib is being evaluated as monotherapy.",,,,

These tumors exhibit both epithelial and stromal features and tend to develop early metastases.  We hypothesize that candidate therapeutics active against these isografts are also likely to be effective in human tumors, which share similar features. The ability to generate and isolate tumor-initiating cells has enabled COARE to accurately predict the response of these cells to investigational compounds, either alone or in combination. These studies have given COARE the unique opportunity to assess the importance of specific target proteins and RNAs in both animal and human cancers. Furthermore this research approach has uncovered novel regulatory mechanisms associated with biological pathways that control cancer stem cell fate and plasticity. In addition to our proprietary siRNA mediated delivery platform, COARE is also developing panels of monoclonal antibodies against key stem cell signaling molecules expressed in tumor initiating cells.

Clinvue is united by a passion for innovation and firm belief that the best solutions are born of a deep understanding of real-time (current) insight into the realities of the rapidly evolving international healthcare environment. Our experience covers a broad range of medical specialties from cardiology to thoracic surgery, imaging to drug delivery, surgical instruments to high volume disposables, and educational services to medical sales and corporate communications. We’re at home scrubbed-in in the OR for 8 hours, in the boardroom, or working with a child or elderly patient in their home.

You will find us lecturing undergraduate and graduate classes at Virginia Tech, Hopkins or Purdue or sharing our knowledge, tools and principles at B2B events around the globe.

One thing we can guarantee is that what is right for one market is rarely right for another and therein lies the very point of gaining cost effective, on-the-ground insight; insight that needs to go beyond simply procedural understanding and product use, to culture, environment, attitudes, and support structure. Recent experience with a FT Global 500 medical company highlighted how pressures of patient throughput in emerging medical markets can have a major impact upon product use, re-use, attitudes toward disposables, packaging, sterility, and consequently, product specification and design.

It is currently developing solutions for the indication Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). The fungus Pneumocystis commonly resides in the lungs of healthy individuals, but the infection PCP does not arise until a person’s immune system is depressed at which time the Pneumocystis pathogens can replicate and cause an infection. PCP is the most common opportunistic infection in HIV/AIDS patients. It also affects other immunocompromised patients including those less than two years of age and over seventy years of age and those undergoing cancer treatment, immunosuppression for organ transplant surgery, corticosteroid treatment, or other immunosuppressive therapy.After infection occurs, PCP has a high mortality rate. MiniVax’s lead product candidate is a monoclonal antibody (PCP-Antibody) for the treatment of PCP. For those patients already suffering from PCP that are plagued by an average mortality rate of 20%, PCP-Antibody will provide an immediate defense against PC by delivering the antibodies needed to fight off the infection and thereby reducing the risk of mortality. A follow on product is a novel vaccine (PCP-Vaccine) for the prevention of PCP. PCP-Vaccine promotes the development of long term anti-Pneumocystis antibodies in patients receiving the vaccine. The antibodies help immunocompromised patients prevent Pneumocystis infection and, therefore, prevent PCP development. Similar to childhood vaccinations, one multi-dose regimen of PCP-Vaccine will be needed to confer lifetime protection. In addition to the therapeutic antibody and vaccine, MiniVax is developing a diagnostic (PCP-Diagnostic) for the detection of a Pneumocystis infection. Currently, clinical diagnosis of PCP is limited to immunohistochemistry and examination of chest X-rays, which have limited sensitivity, specificity, and speed. It takes a highly experienced physician to diagnose PCP. PCP-Diagnostic will provide a quick and accurate means of diagnosing PCP, thus ensuring that the appropriate treatment is prescribed in a timely manner. The preliminary technology for MiniVax’s PCP products was developed by Dr. Jay Kolls and Dr. Mingquan Zheng at Louisiana State University Health and Science Center (LSUHSC). Drs. Kolls and Zheng initially studied an immunogenic protein in Pneumocystis called Kexin, which provided protection against Pneumocystis in initial animal studies. Approximately five years and $4 million were spent in the lab developing this technology before MiniVax became operational in mid-2011. Currently, MiniVax is further developing the technology through federal and state grants.",Seed,110000,USD,110000

The method, known as Oxidative Hydrothermal Dissolution (OHD) is simple, using only hot (subcritical) liquid water and oxygen to break down these macromolecular organic materials into their constituent aromatic and aliphatic compounds. The OHD process can also be used for environmental remediation of organic-containing sites, such as oil sands tailings and coal waste ponds. This modular, environmentally–friendly process produces very little CO2, giving the technology a low carbon footprint. OHD requires no pre-treatment of the feed, or additional catalysts, enzymes or solvents (other than water). The OHD bioliquor can be used as a fulvate-type biostimulant and soil enhancer, and high-value, platform biochemicals can also be recovered as saleable products through an add-on option to the main conversion process. The product suite depends on the choice of feedstock and the process conditions. Thermaquatica’s goal is to use OHD technology to produce chemicals similar or identical to petroleum-derived products, using low-cost alternative raw materials such as waste biomass or coal. The resulting products can be sold as fine chemicals, used in manufacturing of biodegradable plastics and polymers, and/or converted to liquid fuels.

ADispell research has revealed a novel mechanism that explains the onset of cognition loss and has discovered and validated lead compounds through in vivo experiments that interact favorably with the mechanism. The Company has performed successful laboratory work and has a scientific plan to make the technology attractive to the pharmaceutical industry for licensing.  ADispell operates a â€˜license in - add value â€“ license outâ€™ model that will result in a much faster investment payback than other pharmaceutical projects. This payback structure is based on licensing fees, milestone payments, and royalties from product sales. The business has completed technology licensing from Cornell University and expects substantial income during the next three years, which will produce an attractive, rapid investment return.  The experienced ADispell management team will take the promising technology, patented by Cornell, and advance it into a robust development of interest to one or more â€˜big pharmaâ€™ companies, by proceeding through the middle, formative stages of the pharmaceutical drug development process, and then executing a license with a pharma development company. The licensing company is expected to develop at least one blockbuster drug for memory loss by completing the clinical trial stage of this process. This three-year ADispell project will proceed with investor and grant support in the first year and then with funding from pharmaceutical partners during years two and three. At least one significant payment event is expected at the end of three years as a pharma company licenses the technology for clinical trial and final development for sale. ADispell expects to stay involved with the project in an ongoing development role during this time. Longer term income (after 7 to 9 years) includes royalty payments based on the blockbuster drug sales with development milestone payments occurring in the time between these two payment periods.
