Breweries and wineries of all sizes around the world have now chosen to replace the time-consuming and human error - prone standard method (yeast cell count using haemocytometer) with Oculyze, a far more reliable, fast, and cost-saving solution for monitoring fermentation during all the stages of the production process.  While working on constantly improving its flagship products, Oculyze also focuses on bringing the advantages of cloud-based image recognition, like faster development time, lower cost and better image recognition to other applications such as ethanol and bioethanol (or ethanol fuel) production, blood or sperm counts, parasite detection in feces, asbestos fiber detection, emulsion analysis, and bacteria detection, thereby continuing to add applications to its cloud-based image recognition platform.   Oculyze can offer turnkey solutions to businesses, integrating three essential components – the image analysis platform (for data storage & backup, user authentication, and task handling), a custom image analysis & recognition software and the image capture software developed by Oculyze.

In addition, as an alternative to composting and fermentation, the process supports the reduction of polluting emissions such as nitrous oxide, methane and ammonia.  Another advantage of the florafuel process is that the bioenergy or energy sources that can be supplied via the process are suitable for baseload. Since the combustion or gasification of florafuel fuels is decentralized, it is possible to provide precisely the energy that is needed in the form of electricity and heat on site at any time. Thus, the florafuel process is an ideal addition to the bioenergy mix from an ecological as well as an economic point of view.",,50000,EUR,56567

Genome analyses are the basis for most research and development projects in the life sciences. Genome data is used, for example, to study the effects of drug candidates in animal experiments in the pharmaceutical industry. Genome mapping is crucial for breeding new varieties in the seed industry, and in biotechnology for developing yeasts with new properties. Every day, thousands of genomes are sequenced worldwide. However, most of this data is difficult to find and usually only one aspect of the data is analysed.  Analysing genome data means assigning a function to each individual letter in the genome. The difficulty is that genomes are up to 30 billion letters long but consist of only 4 different letters. And only about 1% of the letters in the genome contain important information like genes. Based on 20 years of genome research, we have developed a new, proprietary software, which we use in combination with a database of all the world's sequenced creatures to perform genome analyses with unprecedented quality and speed. Customers can have their own genomes analysed in service or use mendle, a Google-like search, to search our database for information that interests them.",,,,

The focus of the product portfolio is medical technology products. Their different technologies are also used to refine cosmetics, consumer goods and industrial products. Bio-Gate technology is based on the antimicrobial activity of silver ions. The company employs only pure metallic silver. Bio-Gate uses two different technologies. In the first, silver particles are incorporated into cosmetics, paints, veneers or plastics. The second involves coating final products – such as implants or wound dressings – with a silver-containing functional layer. Both technologies use extremely small particles of silver, to ensure that as many silver ions as possible are released. The particles used are small, spongy and porous, which promotes silver ion release. Another advantage is that particle structure allows very precise dosage and sustained effects.",,,,
