Lap-Pak can be placed quickly and eliminates the need for repositioning during surgery. This allows the surgical team to fully focus on the surgery while saving up to 25 minutes of expensive surgery time (approximately $1,000 savings per procedure).

What we are doing is crucial for 350 million patients, as depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide. The burden of depression and other mental health conditions is on the rise globally.

A successful cure continues to elude our industry and these millions of patients, despite billions of dollars of investment by some of the brightest minds and development teams in our industry.    Based on research and clinical results to date, we believe that we have found the key that unlocks the door to a successful therapy for TRD, as well as a promising platform for other diseases such as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Depression in Parkinson’s, and Impulsive Compulsive Disorders (ICD).   With our patented pharmacologic innovation and further clinical development, we intend to restore a happy and productive life to millions of people afflicted with TRD, MDD, ICD and other CNS diseases.

Focused exclusively on the independent medical practice, iPractice Group  currently services medical practices in more than 20 states.  Their goal is to provide independent physician practices with affordable, high quality resources like those available to large health systems. Their vision is to improve the workflow efficiency and total advancement of the independent medical practice.

Seeing that the healthcare IT industry was not prepared to handle the massive demand soon to be faced by hospitals and physician practices, the founders, Ting Chang and Jason Morgan, predicted that small group and solo physician practices would likely be underserved by quality resources and incentives would not be utilized as intended. Headquartered in Nashville TN, iPractice Group was formed by entrepreneurs Jason Morgan and Ting Chang. iPractice Group is located at 51 Century Boulevard, Suite 125, Nashville, TN 37214.",,2517000,USD,2517000
