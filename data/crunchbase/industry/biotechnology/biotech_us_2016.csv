The platfomr focuses on analysis of user interaction with common electronic devices to capture functional decline related to neurodegenerative disorders. The fine control of typing and touch screen kinematics together with the frequent use of electronic devices allows for precise monitoring of small changes in neurodegeneration that frequently go unnoticed by clinicians. nQ allows for early detection of disease, 24/7, passive, at home, remote monitoring of disease progression and the measurement of impact of therapy at a fraction of the cost of current gold standards. There is no required task. Just use your device as your would normally use it. Of note, as one of the company's medical advisors, Zoltan Mari, MD, of the Cleveland Clinic, so aptly quoted: ""As important as it is to fund novel compounds for treating diseases, it is also important to set the stage for maximum impact when those compounds are discovered and approved for use. It is impossible to find a cure without early detection. That's why drug candidates fail. When the FDA puts its stamp on the first disease modifying drugs, such early detection technologies will be instantly necessary."" He goes on to state further: ""We also need a disease progression marker. Nothing so far has managed to do very well (while being profoundly expensive). Much of our research and clinical interest is turning toward disease progression. All efforts should focus on readying and perfecting early detection tools and building effective, reliable, inexpensive ways of tracking disease and the impact of therapy over time.” nQ is that early detection, disease progression computational biomarker.",Seed,4450000,USD,4450000

Strong rare-earth magnets are used to manually guide devices placed inside the human body, while real-time, low-cost ultrasound provides visual feedback to the clinician to ensure safety. This platform technology, invented by the company founder, has the potential to disrupt multiple medical procedures, substantially reducing costs while improving safety and patient experience. Their lead use case, selected because of its low risk, clear FDA pathway, and strong commercial viability, is for the insertion of gastrostomy tubes. They have defined the use of Coaptive Ultrasound to perform this novel gastrostomy procedure, as Percutaneous Ultrasound Gastrostomy (PUG). Briefly, PUG is a point-of-care (as opposed to the operating room) procedure for inserting gastrostomy tubes which can be quickly and easily performed by non-surgical providers. It employs readily available medical devices such as ultrasound, feeding tubes, guide wires, and dilators.",Early Stage Venture,15385000,USD,15385000

Piton’s lead pipelines, IBD/Ulcerative Colitis & Autism Spectrum Disorder, target unmet needs in markets with 5 million and 50+ million patients, respectively. Parkinson’s Disease constitutes a third area of focus. Piton's therapeutic approach for Ulcerative Colitis uniquely targets a cause of the disease for a sub-type constituting ~45% of the patient population. The approach has strong support in the clinical community and represents a potential ‘paradigm change’ in the treatment of the disease. In-human trials are anticipated in 2025. Recently published research suggests that Piton’s therapeutic strategy for UC may have application in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and weight loss management. Piton’s therapeutic approach for Autism Spectrum Disorder has been validated in successive, in-vivo experiments. Several drug candidates are under consideration for what could be the first approved drug to treat the core symptoms of ASD. Application of Piton’s discovery platform for Parkinson’s Disease led to the discovery of a causative hypothesis and a target for novel therapeutic intervention.

Prior to launching OsmoTherapeutics in 2016, Dr. Salim Shah collaborated on a two-year head lice research clinical with a French counterpart.  Their joint effort led to the development of a breakthrough solution to completely eliminate head lice infestations.  Their study concluded that the incomplete removal of nits in the hair leads to the birth of new lice, and consequently, lice recurrence.  Lice recurs because no treatment effectively removes all nits from the hair.  As no available treatment for head lice was 100% ovicidal (able to kill 100% of lice eggs, or nits), the two doctors created a formula that was thoroughly effective at eliminating all nits and all lice. Licemosis Anti-Lice Gel and OsmoBliss Shampoo were thus developed.  The research undertaken and the findings of the team’s clinical research led to the development of these 100% effective products, designed to effectively clear head lice safely and quickly. Their pesticide and toxic-free biological process detaches and kills nits, and also kills the lice that laid them on the hair, including ‘super lice.’ At OsmoTherapeutics, we are committed to fully putting an end to lice recurrence.
