Aptamers are short DNA or RNA sequences that offer high-affinity and specificity to virtually all types of targets. They can therefore be thought of as synthetic nucleic acid equivalents of antibodies. Aptamers are versatile, cost effective and offer a complementary or alternative solution to antibodies. We have over 20 years combined expertise in the development of nucleic acid aptamers to peptides, proteins, cells, tissue samples, micro-organisms and small molecules. The Aptamer Group of companies has cutting edge platforms for the selection of aptamers. These include semi-automated selection platforms which ensure accurate replication of selection conditions to ensure the best quality aptamers result. We can use a wide range of targets: peptide, proteins, whole cells, viruses, small molecules etc. The typical aptamer selection process can be completed in a matter of weeks. Monoclonal antibodies usually take several months to generate. Our custom service can be focussed on a particular application so that the resultant aptamers are pre-optimized for use with a given detection platform, sample type and assay buffer.  Aptamers themselves are increasingly being perceived as the state of the art reagent of choice for a wide range of applications including: Imaging experiments: fluorescence, bright field and phase contrast, IHC, ICC Quantification: ELISA (or ELONA), homogeneous assays etc. Rapid diagnostics: Lateral flow devices, biosensors, electrochemical detection, nano-wires  Binding studies: label free detection, SPR, Biolayer Interferometry Purification: affinity chromatography  We also offer an aptamer based assay development service.  Our solution can be used to identify aptamers for virtually any application and against almost any target in almost any condition.

The Companyâ€™s first product is a nonâ€“contact respiratory monitoring system for physician assessment, called PneumaScanâ„¢, which has clinical applications in a number of medical environments. Using PneumaScanâ„¢, patients can be assessed while breathing naturally or performing spirometric manoeuvres without the need to breathe into, interact with or contact the measuring device. PneumaCare's products, the PneumaScanâ„¢ family, enables clinicians to access many different patient-types, many of which are not within the capabilities of current clinical devices.  The system is being constantly evaluated in clinical practice, currently at Addenbrookeâ€™s Hospital in Cambridge, Great Ormond Street Childrenâ€™s Hospital in London and in development laboratories at its design and manufacturing partner, Plextek. PneumaScanâ„¢ produces standard medical outputs for a broader portion of the population because it observes patients from a distance and does not impede the respiratory system as with current spirometer technology. Measuring from a distance means lower infection risk, less harm, reduced patient discomfort and minimal instrument running costs from having to replace or sterilise parts which have contacted the patient.",,3448000,GBP,5540519

The company was founded by Sean Hird and Mike Jones in 2007 with the aim to innovate in the field of nematode and aphid control. Both nematodes and aphids are significant pests of the world’s major crops against which there is limited natural resistance. In particular, plant parasitic nematodes are devastating root pathogens causing global losses of US$125bn+ pa. These small thread-like worms are endemic in all soil types and reduce yields through impaired water and nutrient uptake and increased susceptibility to other root pathogens. Likewise, losses from aphids are also very high due to the physical damage they cause and their role as a vector for plant viruses and other invasive organisms. It is estimated that aphids are the primary vector for 50% of all known plant viruses. Building on the expertise and experience of Mike Jones, an internationally regarded expert in the field of plant nematology and virology, Nemgenix has focussed on the development of novel RNAi-based crop traits to confer nematode and aphid resistance. RNA interference (‘RNAi’) is an endogenous gene silencing mechanism found in plants and other organisms which can be exploited through the design of biotech traits. Nemgenix has successfully shown proof-of-concept of its utility in a range of plant species. This work has led to a number of patent filings which are now being prosecuted in all major territories. Nemgenix is currently working with several corporate partners to progress its RNAi-based nematode control traits with field trials anticipated in 2014. Nemgenix is constructing specially designed field trial plots where nematode populations can be manipulated and soil conditions modelled, to reflect field conditions in a range of key growing areas. In 2012 Nemgenix’s Crop Protection Unit was formed to undertake the development of an integrated in silico pesticide discovery platform known as ‘i-QUEST™’. This will combine with the company’s bioassay systems and field trial resources to provide a ‘screen to field’ pesticide development capability. In the case of nematodes, the use of chemical controls is often limited by environmental legislation and cost which has resulted in increased demand for new nematicides. The i-QUEST™ platform is currently being used to exploit this opportunity. Nemgenix has research and development facilities in Perth, Australia at the Western Australia State Agricultural Biotechnology Centre and also in Harpenden, UK. Nemgenix has a team of 10 full-time researchers. The company secured seed investment in 2008 from Stone Ridge Ventures, an Australian venture capital firm, and has been awarded numerous government grants.",,,,
