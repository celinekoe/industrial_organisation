From the time of the company’s inception, Oramed has successfully tested its technology via various animal and human studies on its two flagship products, an oral insulin capsule, ORMD-0801, and an oral exenatide (a GLP-1 Analog) capsule, ORMD-0901. Combination therapy (ORMD 0801+0901) showed promising results in pre-clinical trials, and clinical trials are expected to follow.  Oramed's unique oral delivery technology serves as a platform for other vaccines and medications currently available in injection form. The company is approached by pharmaceutical companies large and small looking to test compliance with Oramed’s technology on their product pipeline. Oramed has garnered worldwide support of prominent scientists to its scientific advisory board, a testament to its sound technology:  the former Senior VP of Pfizer, Dr. Michael Berelowitz; Prof. John Amatruda, former Senior VP of Merck and Co.; Prof. Ele Ferrannini, Past President of the EASD*; and Prof. Avram Hershko, 2004 Nobel Prize Laureate in Chemistry, and a leader in the field of drug delivery methods, among others. The office of the Chief Scientist of Israel has also shown its confidence in Oramed’s technology, having awarded Oramed its third consecutive grant to continue its research. Recent and promising developments at Oramed also include 5 patent approvals for its technologies in the Israeli, Japanese, Australian, and New Zealand Patent Offices. Patent approval is particularly important as it validates Oramed’s technology, establishing an international stronghold for its oral protein delivery methods. Oramed has an additional 34 pending patents and expects to see more of them approved in the future.",IPO,227891643,USD,227891643

"OcuMedic, Inc.",https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ocumedic-inc,"Biotechnology, Health Care, Medical","Mullica Hill, New Jersey, United States",OcuMedic is a drug delivery & medical device company that develops therapeutic contact lenses.,"112,650",,Active,2006-05-01,day,,,,,For Profit,http://ocumedic.net,"OcuMedic’s technology:  Timed Drug Delivery to the Eye via a Contact Lens/Clear Corneal Bandage with 7 Day wear.The technology rests on 10 issued patents, and a recent Freedom to Operate (FTO) opinion. Efficacy has been proven in an animal model. The intellectual property teaches a novel therapeutic contact lens with memory capable of controlled release of first line ophthalmic agents, both anti-inflammatory and antibiotic. The technology has been developed for the most common and widely used contact lens material silicon hydrogel, (SiHy). The technology is also a platform technology and has been tested for a wide range of ten (10)  other drugs as well as molecules to enhance lens comfort and treat dry eye.  Controlled release from contact lenses has been the subject of discussions and investigation for fifty, (50) years as eye doctors attempted to soak lens in drugs gaining negligible   therapeutic effect.  Previous engineered   methods suffer from either poor control of the release profile   or   inadequate drug loading with the overwhelming majority of researchers demonstrating both problems. Thus, there are no products on the market today. With the OcuMedic’s method   memory for the drug is produced during polymer synthesis where monomers are complexed non-covalently to the drug and crosslinked into a hydrogel matrix. Upon removal of the drug, macromolecular memory sites remain within the hydrogel with affinity for the drug. The drug’s heightened interaction with these memory pockets enhances its loading and SLOWS its transport within the hydrogel despite comparable free volume of drug transport. It has been shown that the extension of release has a strong dependence on mimicking biological recognition in the design exploiting the chemical diversity and amounts of monomers in relation to the drug. Thus, OcuMedic can literally…. DIAL IN THE RELEASE OF DRUG FROM THE LENS OVER TIME delivering a therapeutic concentration of drug payload for the duration of wear.Key Milestones: The biggest hurdle and Key Milestone has been the development of the enabling break thru technology on how to control the sustained kinetics of drug release in a SiHy lens for duration of wear AND maintain other lens properties such as; modulus, optical clarity, thickness, and oxygen diffusivity. OcuMedic’s patented technology creates a new architecture with memory for the drug within the polymeric network comprising the contact lens to enable continuous, controlled, release of the drug to the eye. The non-obvious proprietary solution was the development of the macromolecular memory   release concept utilizing and optimizing interactions between the drug and chemistry within the lens via multiple polymer chains within the network structure. Second, securing the World-Wide license from Auburn University 18 months ago which include 9 Granted Patents and now 10 with the recent European grant.   The OcuMedic’s Market & Solution:   Currently topical eye drops wash out quickly with only ~5% of the drug getting to the desired site. Most eye drop therapeutic regimens require multiple drops per day and most patients miss their doses which leads to complication costing   $70 billion per year. The OcuMedic’s solution is continuous dosing using contact lens with visual correction or a clear contact bandage providing more efficacious and convenient therapy DECREASING COMPLICATIONS and reducing HEALTH CARE COSTS.   Currently Optometrists in the US   are enabled as physicians under Medicare and under state licensure dispense diagnostic and therapeutic agents. With the advent of “co-management” of patients undergoing cataract surgery (4million procedure/year) or Lasik (800K procedures/year) and post-corneal abrasions (1million/year) the Optometrist along with the  19,000 Surgical Ophthalmologist are ideally suited to deliver OcuMedic’s therapy both by license and as the prevailing optometric contact lens fitters that hold inventory in their practices in the case of the 33,000 US Optometrists.. OcuMedic’s technology will provide clinicians a powerful, new tool to treat patients. Use of Funds: The laboratory porotypes lens is complete with in-vivo data that supports efficacy. The next stage in the development are Pre-clinical studies in order to navigate the FDA as further bench  animal studies are planned to validate SAFETY. The timing is thirteen (13) months costing $1.5M. This development is planned to stage OcuMedic for the 1-2 multi - site human clinical trials to further validate safety and assess efficacy and bioequivalence requiring 30 months costing $2.5M. There is a potential for multiple EXIT points along the development path each with a higher valuation. Management believes the Series A could be the last money in the company with an EXIT at Phase 1-2 or 2 based on recent take outs at this level with proof of efficacy in humans.

These processed shreds of the tumor cells are then injected back into the patient, stimulating his or her immune system to attack the cancer. A virus-lysed tumor cell vaccine is an active immunotherapeutic agent against tumors in patients. Tumor cells are removed from a patient, the cells are cultured in the laboratory and infected with live vaccinia virus—the active component of the vaccine that eradicated smallpox. During incubation, viral oncolysis occurs, in which the virus enters the tumor cells and breaks them open, spilling their contents, in a process known as lysis. The resulting viral oncolysate has lost the ability to grow as a tumor, but can be recognized by the patient’s immune system as the tumor.

Another 250,000 patients have exhausted non-surgical treatment and opt for surgery. Minimus Spine believes that it can benefit these patients with a single injection and reduce the number of patients that ultimately need surgery.Minimus Spine is developing ozone injection technology specifically for spinal applications. Ozone has been used to treat disc herniations in Europe for over 15 years and there are over 20 peer-reviewed papers documenting over 8,000 patients. We have improved upon the existing technology through a system that creates ozone, and measures its concentration, within in a sterile, syringe-cartridge (patents pending). This has advantages in terms of sterility and dose assurance, as well as material compatibility, which are vital to the advancement of this technique. Minimus will commercialize its product outside the United States and then begin working with FDA to offer this technology in the U.S. This will involve rigorous clinical trials conducted by spine surgeons and interventional radiologists.  The study will seek to confirm that an injection of ozone into a herniated disc is both safe and effective. The results of these trials will be submitted to FDA for marketing approval. Currently, ozone cannot be legally marketed for medical application in the U.S. and FDA has justifiably taken enforcement actions against manufacturer’s that promote this treatment without FDA approval. This product is not yet available but the push is being made to begin clinical trials in 2011.  Check back periodically for more information.
