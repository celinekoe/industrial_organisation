Fermented Tirshik Soup strengthens                                            the immune system with its powerful antioxidant content proved with scientific research.

Its public name is “Andırın Doctor”. Making the soup is very labor intensive                       and traditional methods must be followed carefully. It has been consumed as home meal in the                       Osmaniye region for centuries and has never been industrially produced until now. After the Covid 19                        pandemic, Arum maculatum sales exploded in neighborhood markets. The sellers are calling out loudly                        about the plant  “Corona Killer''.

After                      fermentation, it miraculously turns into an extraordinarily beneficial food for human health. On                      September 20, 2021, a regulation was published by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, stating that                      It is afterall in the positive category in the list of plants that indicates edible and non-edible ones.

Ecovon will bring the first non-additive, bio-based, renewable wood product to market which is naturally flame retardant and anti-fungal without added binders (glues). The physical properties are better than comparable engineered woods on the market currently, all which use additives and heavy chemicals to reach additional flame retardant properties while reducing our CO2 footprint, deforestation and enriching the lives of locals in coconut and sugarcane producing developing countries such as Ghana. The board material has been shown to exhibit excellent properties, which are comparable with or even superior to commercial wood based panels. Our product is stronger and more durable, priced considerably less, and greener. Coconut husk has the highest lignin content of any known plant and this helps the raw material to bind into a hard board without the addition of any damaging glue or binder. Due to its strength the board has the potential to be used for structural elements in buildings. It also has natural anti-fungal properties and burns three times slower than wood. The method is sustainable and environmentally friendly. The residual material of the coconut is used in its entirety. It is a good alternative to wood and helps to prevent deforestation. During production, glue and chemical agents do not need to be added. Furthermore, the production is CO2 neutral. It is inexpensive. The glue that has to be added when boards based on wood fibre are made contributes to one third of the total production costs. Glue is not required to process coconut husk into board material.
