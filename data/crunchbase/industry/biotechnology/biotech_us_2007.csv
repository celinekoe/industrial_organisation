Its first commercial application will be as a more reliable means of vascular access for dialysis patients, with a subsequent application to treat peripheral artery disease.  We have great results in multiple controlled animal studies, a large patent portfolio, established production capacity, and are ready to begin human studies later this year in preparation for market launch. Near-Term Problem / Market Opportunity:  Vascular Access for Dialysis Kidney failure patients need to have their blood filtered 3 times per week via dialysis.  This removes waste from the blood, which would otherwise cause them to die.  However, current methods for repeatedly accessing the bloodstream for dialysis are unreliable.  This problem is a huge contributor to the $50 billion per year that the U.S. spends on dialysis patients (7% of Medicare’s entire budget!).  A vascular graft is often implanted under the skin (connecting an artery to a vein) to create an access site with sufficient bloodflow for dialysis -- but existing grafts tend to occlude quickly, requiring repeated expensive interventions to keep them open. Solution:  STARgraft Because our vascular graft remains open to blood flow much longer than existing grafts, it can potentially satisfy a severe unmet clinical need for ready-to-use, safe, long-term dialysis access, while substantially reducing costs, illness and death rate among dialysis patients. Product Pipeline We have additional products in development, including an implantable port which will allow needle-free dialysis.  Eliminating the use of needles would further reduce cost and illness among dialysis patients, and allow them to perform dialysis in the convenience of their own home.  In addition, our platform STAR biomaterial can improve the performance of a wide range of implantable devices via its remarkable ability to prevent both infection and scar tissue.  We currently have two corporate-funded development contracts to explore STAR material’s use in multiple other device applications. ",Early Stage Venture,19430000,USD,19430000

Technology CryoMedix has patents pending for four components that comprise its next generation cryoablation platform technology. Single Phase Liquid Coolants: A group of compounds which have the unique attribute of remaining in a liquid state between room temperature and -190°C when maintained under slight pressure. The characteristics of these compounds provide for significantly more wattage/power than current gas systems. This superior cooling capability provides the ability to completely ablate nerves and tissue anywhere in the body. Feedback System: The feedback system provides the physician information regarding the status of the creation of the ice in real time. This system also allows for the automation of the freeze cycle thereby increasing the ease of use and the ability to consistently obtain good clinical outcomes. Increased Surface Area Designs of Disposables: Catheter or needle with a multitubular configuration and/or a corrugated surface. The disposables can be rigid or flexible. These designs result in a significant increase in surface area of the disposable resulting in a proportional improvement in the effectiveness of the cooling agent thereby allowing for use of smaller diameter size disposables or a faster freeze. Rechargeable Cartridge System:  The rechargeable system is a small refrigeration device that chills the liquid coolant to the desired temperature. The small insulated canisters of approximately 2-16 ounces, depending on the particular application, are pre-chilled and maintained at the desired temperature until used in a procedure. The canisters are reusable. The use of a small rechargeable cartridge system eliminates the need for the large tanks of gas required by other cryoablation technologies. The recycling of the cooling agent is environmentally friendly and represents another factor that contributes to the lower cost of the platform technology. The superior power and capability of CM’s technology has been demonstrated in a number of animal studies done on behalf of other companies as well as in an animal study performed at the University of San Diego Medical Center by Greg Feld MD, Chairman of the UCSD Electrophysiology Department.  This latter study confirmed the ability to create transmural linear lesions of up to 8 cm in length in the heart with none of the safety concerns associated with heat ablation. Additional expected benefits of this technology are the improved clinical outcomes, the ability to consistently attain this superior clinical result through the use of the feedback system, the significant reduction in the procedure time and the substantially lower cost of manufacturing the disposable component of the device.",,500000,USD,500000

In contrast to electromyography, or EMG, which relies on needles to detect subtle changes in electrical signals in muscle, Sentio MMG® smart-sensors employ proprietary accelerometer technology.

Webley and his team of engineers and scientists developed a unique Photocatalytic Oxidation (PCO) air purification system and Manganese Oxide (MnOx) air purification system which had been designed to address the concerns of formaldehyde, ozone and VOC pollution. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) challenged scientists to develop air purification technology for trailers supplied by FEMA to house many of the displaced residents of New Orleans.  These trailers were exposing occupants to high levels of formaldehyde and other VOCs’ off-gassing from the composite wood and other materials used in trailer construction.

Clinical studies have shown that SPE can deliver active ingredients to 60-70 micrometers below the skin barrier.

The estimated market size for those that suffer from Late Phase Asthmatic Response is 2.3 million people and there is currently no competition in the marketplace for a preventative solution such as the one Equon is proposing. Today individuals who suffer from this type of response need to seek immediate medical attention to restore the ability to breathe. When the antibodies are taken by the patient on a monthly basis, it will prevent the late phase asthmatic response from happening within the body. The target is to have FDA approval by 2019 and achieve a 25% penetration rate by 2021 with an annual sales target of $673 M.    Rheumatoid Arthritis impacts an estimate of 1.5 million people. There is substantial competition in the space including drugs such as Humira. However, most of the drugs offered to treat patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis have significant side effects including but not limited to the development of cancer and in severe cases death. Equon’s antibodies will be able to provide a much safer solution with the expectation of minimal side effects.
