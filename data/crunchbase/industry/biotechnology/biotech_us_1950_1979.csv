On February 10, 2014, Techne Corporation, R&D Systems parent company, announced that it will be operating under the new trade name, Bio-Techne. The use of Bio-Techne will bring the company’s R&D Systems, BiosPacific, Tocris Biosciences, Boston Biochem and Bionostics products under one common brand name. For more information on Bio-Techne please visit bio-techne.com. R&D Systems, a Minnesota-based biological products company, started by producing hematology controls and calibrators for use in hospitals and clinics. In 1977, we introduced our first product, a platelet-rich-plasma control, and in 1981, we became the second manufacturer in the world to release a whole blood control with platelets. Over the years, R&D Systems Hematology has continued to develop a variety of hematology controls. These products continue to be available through our Clinical Controls Division. In 1985, we released our first research reagent, TGF-beta 1, becoming the first company in the world to produce this cytokine commercially. TGF-beta 1 acts as an extracellular signaling molecule that is produced by many cell types. It is involved in such processes as immune function, cell proliferation, and cell differentiation. Following the launch of this product, we purified several other cytokines from natural sources and released them to the research market. Of great interest to biomedical researchers, cytokines are specialized proteins mediating communication between cells. They have many biological activities including regulating developmental processes and orchestrating the immune response. In addition, unregulated cytokine activity has been linked to many diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and inflammatory disorders. Encouraged by success in the cytokine market, we formed the Growth Factor (now known as Biotechnology) Division in 1985 with the goal of producing and marketing a wide range of human cytokines through genetic engineering. Recombinant DNA technology offers several advantages over extraction of these proteins from natural sources, including lower production cost and potentially unlimited supply. In 1989, the Biotechnology Division began developing monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to cytokines, and in 1990 we developed our first enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Currently, R&D Systems, Tocris Bioscience, and Boston Biochem will serve as the flagship brands in Bio-Techne's life science portfolio. In the coming months a new corporate identity, including new packaging, new literature, new trade show booth, as well as a new unified website will be introduced to customers.",,,,

Acne is the most common skin disease in the world — 80 percent of all people experience an acne breakout at some point in their lives, often during the teenage years. Acne is a skin condition in which the pores become clogged with sebum (oil) and dead skin cells. These clogs are referred to as comedones or blackheads and whiteheads. Propionibacterium acnes bacteria found on the skin can becomes trapped in these clogged pores. As the bacteria thrive on the sebum and pustule begins to form. Over time this triggers an inflammatory response from and a deep tender cystic lesion may form, which may eventually lead to follicle rupture if untreated. Eczema, also called atopic dermatitis, is one of the diagnoses you get when you have red spots on your skin that become inflamed and itchy. A top dermatologist in Manhattan recognizes the symptoms right away and recommends the best treatment for eczema based on your current health and medical history. A chronic yet routine skin condition in people over the age of 30, rosacea generally manifests itself as the extreme visibility of red blood vessels in your cheeks, nose, and forehead. It often appears in flare-ups lasting for several weeks or even months, only to then temporarily disappear into remission. Unless you have it treated, it will continue to recur. Psoriasis is one of the more misunderstood skin disorders today. It’s a condition where your skin cells’ life cycle changes so that they regenerate much more rapidly. In fact, skin cells multiply 10 times faster with psoriasis. As a result, the cells build up on the surface of your skin. ",,,,
