This new therapeutic approach is called Autologous Insulin Producing (AIP) cell transplantation. Beta cell replacement is one of the most promising approaches for treatment of Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM). Currently, pancreas islet transplantation is the only approved cell replacement technology and it's the best available treatment for diabetics. However, it's impractical because of a shortage of donor tissue and rejection rate by the patient' immune system. Orgenesis believes that converting the diabetic patients own tissue to insulin producing cells will overcome the problem of donor shortage. Moreover, since the diabetic patient serves as his/her own donor, there is no risk of transplant rejection.

It didn't start out as Laxco, but rather a venture between two unlikely partners. Back in the early 90's two gentlemen by the names of Eric Chen and Steve Lytle formed a partnership that changed the face of 2 completely different industries. As young entrepreneurs, Steve and Eric saw a need for higher quality of imported Chinese manufactured products. The idea was simple, Steve would form a company in the US and handle setting up the distribution channels, while Eric would set up a factory in China and handle the supply chain.  Their focus was on quality, and all products shipped to the US would go through a quality control inspection, labeling, and packaging, prior to shipping out to customers or to distributors. This insured that product with the Westover Scientific label, meant that it meet higher quality standards than products simply shipped into the US and put directly onto shelf's for customers to purchase. As the companies grew, so did their ambition, and quickly they realized that ""why simply just import, why not develop our own products"", and so began a legacy that has lead to two successful startups in the Telecommunication and Life Science industries.     Westover Scientific was the first venture in which they started out developing and imported refractometers, microscopes, and fiber optic light sources. However in the late 90's an opportunity presented it self and first handheld fiber microscope was born. It was a simple design, that fit into the palm of your hand and allowed the technician to visually inspect the end of fiber optic cables prior to mating them. This ensured the end face of the fiber was free of dust, scratches or any other imperfections that might inhibit the laser from passing between connectors. Their concept and design quickly took off, and development of video based microscopes was soon introduced. By early 2000 Westover had grown to become a market leader in microscopes for the telecommunication industry and was soon purchased by a large Telecom giant.  ",,1000000,USD,1000000

Marathon focuses on the creation of small-volume, hard-to-manufacture medications that are often overlooked by larger pharmaceutical companies – in addition to its offices, Marathon recently announced the opening of the Marathon Bioscience Center in Chicago, which focuses on the development of treatments for cancer, central nervous system diseases, movement disorders, gastrointestinal diseases, and endocrine deficiencies. Marathon’s goal is to get therapies into the hands of patients who need them the most, all while ensuring the quality of their products. The staff at the bioscience center is composed of clinical, research, and regulatory staff who work in tandem to produce next-generation treatments for rare diseases. Outside of prescription medications, Marathon is also constructing a pipeline of treatments for rare cancers and neurological conditions. High-need, hard-to-manufacture medications do not reach the patient market overnight – Marathon’s team realizes this, and works with players from across the healthcare spectrum to deliver the best care possible. Two medications developed by Marathon in the barbiturate derivative class of treatments, Amytal Sodium and Seconal Sodium, assist patients in the short-term treatment of insomnia – these medications are nonselective central nervous system depressants and work by depressing the central nervous system. Aside from treatments for insomnia, Marathon also developed Opium Tincture and Pepcid, two medications that assist patients with gastrointestinal disorders. Pepcid is a histamine H2-receptor antagonist that reduces the amount of acid in patients’ stomachs, and Opium Tincture treats diarrhea.  The most widely covered treatment produced by Marathon, perhaps, is ZiNGO. This single-use, easy-to-administer powdered lidocaine device is used in pediatric patients before venous access (such as the insertion of an IV before surgical procedures.) This revolutionary device reduces the time needed to administer local anesthesia, so the device can be used during procedures.
