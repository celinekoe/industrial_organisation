Unlike competitors' products that remain in the body for a lifetime, Plcoskin’s PCL scaffolds are absorbed and replaced with the recipient’s own natural tissues, minimizing the possibility of long-term side effects. As they do not contain any dangerous chemicals, they are also 50% safer than cadaver-sourced scaffolds. Costs for reconstructive breast surgery are brought down by 40% to only $3 thousand per breast. Furthermore, much less handling time is required, reducing average surgery durations from an hour and a half to only 30 minutes. The mesh design of the scaffolds mitigates the need for an additional follow-up reconstructive surgery, something that is common when using cadaver-sourced scaffolds.

Using their proprietary adenovirus platform, GM is developing several pipeline products that can be intratumorally and intravenously administered to selectively attack and eradicate tumor cells as well as potently stimulating multiple arms of antitumor immune response. GM’s viral immunotherapy has proven effective as both a standalone therapy and in combination with current standard of care, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Intratumoral administration of GM oncolytic adenovirus offers several advantages over competitor products; (1) higher level of virus accumulation and localization in tumor tissues and (2) lower off-target systemic exposure, ultimately exerting potent therapeutic effect with minimal systemic toxicity. Our pipeline can effectively treat wide range of tumor types, including breast cancers (triple-negative and hormone receptor-positive), prostate cancer, melanoma, and non-melanoma skin cancer, desmoplastic cancers (like pancreatic cancer), and injectable visceral tumors that have spread to the liver, such as metastases from colorectal and lung cancer. To treat metastatic and recurrent cancers in late-stage cancer patients, GM has developed systemic delivery platform for oncolytic viruses that avoids rapid blood clearance and inactivation by the immune system and various blood components, which are known to severely hamper the clinical effectiveness of intravenously administered viral immunotherapies. Systemic delivery represents an important next step in successful oncolytic virus treatments for intractable and metastatic cancers that have disseminated to multiple organs.  Headquartered in the Fusion Technology Center, Seoul, South Korea, GM is a leader in oncolytic immunotherapy. GM’s potent multi-armed oncolytic viral platform (GM-OAd) is a culmination of multiple proprietary oncolytic adenovirus technologies, which has been intelligently designed and carefully optimized to ensure maximum therapeutic benefit in patients. The company was founded in 2014 and has been the recipient of Korean venture backing and grants. GM-OAd is a proprietary oncolytic adenovirus that has been extensively engineered to maximize its safety, cancer selectivity, and anti-tumor activity. GM-OAd-mediated oncolysis results in immunogenic cell death to trigger robust antitumor immune activation and memory formation to ensure long-term therapeutic benefit against cancer. GM has a highly scalable, low cost manufacturable platform offering highly versatile, innovative treatment options for patients with advanced or metastatic tumors. Further, they have a deep portfolio of unique, globally protected, intellectual property including patents for systemic delivery platform for oncolytic virus and technologies that ensure effective degradation of tumor extracellular matrix to enhance the intratumoral permeation and distribution of other conventional cancer drugs, like chemotherapy, targeted antibodies, and ICI, to achieve strong synergistic potential.

Stemlab’s cell reprogramming technology takes fully differentiated cells and reprograms them into neural stem cells, allowing them to obtain the stem cells necessary to create stem cell therapies. It thus avoids the ethical issues concernng embryonic stem cell research. Also, its reprogrammed neural stem cells have expansion capability comparable to neural stem cells derived from pluripotent stem cells.
