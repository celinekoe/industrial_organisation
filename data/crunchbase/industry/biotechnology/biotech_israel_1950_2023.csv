Mitochondria are also involved in other essential cellular functions, including calcium sequestration, amino acid and lipid metabolism, keeping balanced redox potential and orchestrating programmed cell death. In neurons in particular, mitochondria are very dynamic organelles that constantly undergo fission (division) and fusion. This process, called mitochondrial dynamics, is critical in maintaining healthy and functional mitochondria under both normal conditions and in response to stress and in ensuring having viable mitochondria along the axons and in the synaptic boutons. A defect in either fusion or fission limits mitochondrial motility, decreases energy production, increases oxidative stress and activates pro-apoptotic signaling thereby promoting cell dysfunction and death. Mitoconix’ lead drug is a first-in-class inhibitor of pathological mitochondrial fragmentation and dysfunction with demonstrated in vivo efficacy in animal models of Huntington’s (HD) and Parkinson’s diseases (PD) and beneficial activity in patient-derived cells of HD, sporadic and genetic PD, and sporadic and genetic Alzheimer’s disease (AD).",Early Stage Venture,20000000,USD,20000000

ViruCure’s robust NADAV platform has already shown the potential to have significant oncolytic effect on a wide range of cancers including Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) and lung cancer, which are the two initial target indications to be addressed by ViruCure. In a Phase 1/2 clinical trial on terminal GBM patients, four of twelve patients responded to treatment and one went into complete remission!  NADAV’s oncolytic effect appears to be a result of both direct destruction of the tumor cells (cell death) and activation of a general anti-tumor immune response. This powerful amplification effect is achieved with very low toxicity because NADAV specifically destroys tumor cells and does not attack normal tissues. Furthermore, since NDV is an avian virus, it has not exhibited any pathological effects or severe illnesses in humans in over forty years of research. ViruCure believes that NADAV may serve as a breakthrough treatment modality where conventional cancer therapies have shown poor results. Given its broad applicability, the NADAV platform will generate an evergreen pipeline of anti-cancer candidates, some of which ViruCure will bring to market on its own and others through strategic partnerships.",Seed,,USD,
