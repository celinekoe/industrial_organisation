Founded by Professor Moshe Szyf, a pioneer in Epigenetics, our company’s mission is to improve lives by detecting and preventing disease before it becomes a major health issue. We are translating the science of epigenetics to a novel platform for clinical laboratory tests. Combining our deep knowledge in epigenetics, next-generation sequencing, and computation, we are developing tests for many of the common cancers, as well as a consumer-based test for biological aging. We have built the first company in the world focused on creating a platform for clinical epigenetics. Our focus is on the platform, not a single test. Our goal is to close the gap between the advances in epigenetic science and the almost nonexistent capacity in clinical epigenetics across the world. We are building a robust platform that can address the demand for the expanding and evolving landscape of epigenetic tests. We believe that the number of clinical tests in this area will grow exponentially and because of the complexity of the processes involved, it is very difficult to provide robust tests at the current clinical laboratory settings.  We are there to fill the gap and capture a good part of this enormous clinical “real estate”. Our unique platform also combines genetic and epigenetic tests as exemplified by our combo “MetaGen-epiAge” test and our combined HPV-epiCervix test. More combined epigenetic-genetic tests are in the pipeline. We developed seven tests for common types of cancers and a consumer-based test for biological aging and genetic disposition to methylation deficiency as well as tests for personalized medicine such as our MGMT test. The power of our platform allows us to have a large pipeline of future tests. Our production and R&D laboratory, designed de novo by our team for automated clinical epigenetics-genetics testing, is located in Hong Kong Science Park. Our lab is accredited by both US CAP and CLIA. It was recently audited again and reaccredited by flying colors. This proves that it is possible to create a clinical epigenetic lab which addresses the highest qualifications in the US. We built our lab in Hong Kong — as well as the cloud-managed SOPs — as a prototype to be copied across the globe, as we develop a global chain of clinical epigenetic labs. We also have a production lab in Shenzhen to serve the Chinese market. We are planning, with the new funding, to first “copy” our lab in the US, Singapore and Bangladesh.",Early Stage Venture,,USD,

We also have been working with BWH in clinical studies. In 2020, Instant NanoBiosensors was one the 12 innovative young companies for worldwide strategic collaboration selected by Merck KGaA. We were selected out of 500 candidates from around the world because of our unique fiber optic microfluidics nano-chip technology. As we can analyze -- with three easy steps -- proteins and nucleic acids like top laboratories, we were the only Asian company selected by Merck KGaA.   Researchers and clinicians rely extensively on biomarkers as research and clinical tools. However, many biomarkers are not detectable using conventional technologies. Under this circumstance, biomarkers only detected with relatively narrow ranges that reflect more advanced disease conditions. For advanced medical research and early disease diagnosis, the biomarker detection range need to expand into wide range.  Our platform utilizes patented Fiber Optic Particle Plasmon Resonance(FOPPR™) and IN-Chip (auto-flowing microfluidic chip) platform technology for the life science research and in vitro diagnostics markets, enabling molecule measurement of proteins, nucleic acids and cells. The technology of combining FOPPR & IN-Chip can shorten the time consumed in detecting biomarker at the laboratory from three hours to just several minutes and enhance the detection sensitivity (pg/ml) and the detection linear range (5 orders) of devices which allows our product to gather data comparable to top diagnostic laboratories.  In the future, miniaturized hand-held devices can be helpful in monitoring prognosis of patients. As data will be sent to the cloud platform, the goal of real-time health management can be achieved.
