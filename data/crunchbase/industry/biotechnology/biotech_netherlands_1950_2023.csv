With Micreos' endolysin technology, for the first time it is possible to kill only the unwanted bacteria - including antibiotic resistant strains such as MRSA - while leaving our microbiome - comprising billions of beneficial bacteria on our skin and in our gut - intact. In addition, research shows that the use of endolysins does not induce resistance.

The company incorporated a second asset, PRODECIS™, which is a clinical decision support system to select the right patients for proton therapy. With these two assets ptTheragnostic aims to achieve more effective, individualised radiation therapy for cancer patients. Taken together, ptTheragnostic is the service company for patient stratification in radiotherapy. ptTheragnostic is a joint effort between MC and the MUMC. MC is one of Europe’s leading radiation therapy facilities. MC has ample expertise in dose modelling, imaging and developing prediction models for survival as well as toxicity outcomes. The research lab and the expertise in experimental design and data-analysis will be utilised via the unit Clinical Genomics of the Department of Clinical Genetics of the MUMC. The strength of this partnership is the unique multidisciplinary team that consists of clinicians, physicists and software developers.
