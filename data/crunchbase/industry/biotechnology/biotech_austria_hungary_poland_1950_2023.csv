This, obviously, always constitutes a risk and might require another unpleasant hospital stay. Thus, developing a stable implant that dissolves naturally as soon as the bone is able to take over the load again is a major step towards avoiding pain and discomfort.

BRI.Screw is the result of eight years of preclinical research, combined with state-of-the-art materials.
