While these molecules have shown remarkable efficacy in animal models of fibrosis, some of them have unique properties for the treatment of cancer. These first-in-class small molecules co-target pathways that provide cardioprotective and synergistic anti-tumor effects with standard-of-care chemotherapies for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). There is a dose-dependent delayed and progressive cardiomyopathy often observed years after cessation of treatment of breast cancer patients anthracyclines such as doxorubicin (Adriamycin). As a result, the leading cause of death in breast cancer survivors is cardiovascular disease, often caused by the same treatments that once saved their lives. NovoMedix compounds have synergistic effects with chemotherapies on cancer cells, potentially enhancing patient response while significantly minimizing cardiotoxicity, ultimately improving long-term survival by reducing mortality due to heart failure. The goal is to initiate IND enabling studies with the lead candidate and to deliver this novel and safe therapy to TNBC patients as soon as possible.",,2000000,USD,2000000
