Versatility: they can be used to transport different types of nucleic acids. Biosafety: they are non immunogenic, any patient can be elegible and re-administration is possible. Specificity: They can be specific for a cell type. Scalable and low-cost production. High levels of cellular internalization. Nanotransfer delivery systems have a chemical affinity for the phosphate backbone, common to all nucleic acids, so the integration of the gene with the delivery system is independent of its sequence. We can decouple the synthesis of the delivery system and that of the geneof interest, which will allow a greater number of therapies to be developed with a positive impact on people´s health. Our non-viral delivery systems are unique not only because they are non-toxic and non-immunogenic but also becasue of their composition and surface properties.

In doing so, we allow for localized immunostimulation/immunosuppression without disrupting the entirety of the body’s immune system, all through non-invasive electromagnetic stimulation. Within bioproduction, our system allows for cellular activation and modulation in batch or chemostatic bioreactors. It grants the ability to modulate, change, and halt synthesis in large-scale bioreactors with ultra-cost-efficient magnetic stimulation. Within research, the MagGenix-platform can solidify magnetogenetics as the clear successor of opto-/chemo- genetic processes to perturb and study biological systems. ​ MagGenix looks to pioneer its magnetogenetic cell therapy platform for patients, pipettes, and production.",,,,

Our mission is to advance meaningful, high quality, and socially-driven medical research. More quality research funded will lead to improved health, effective treatments, and reduction of disease and illness. We have three core values: ​Transparency, Empowerment, and Connection. Transparency - You should know where your money is going when you support medical research. With us, you can learn about the research you are supporting. Because your money goes towards a grant based on reaching milestones, you can have confidence that your contribution will be used for the research you sponsored. You will also have the opportunity to receive regular updates as the study progresses.  Empowerment -  Why do the government, companies, and large organizations get to choose the research that should be funded, but we can't? Research sponsorship shouldn't be limited to millionaires and pharmaceutical companies. Research Lead empowers the average person to make a difference and fund meaningful medical research that matters to them. Meanwhile, researchers are empowered to conduct the research they believe will save lives and make us healthier. Connection- We aim to connect you with researchers and learn their stories and motivations. By connecting researchers and sponsors, we aim to increase awareness of research and improve how research gets communicated. Together, we can create a community dedicated to research that will make a difference for all of us. Researchers submit their studies to Research Lead to be reviewed by our experts. We review the studies to ensure that they meet Research Lead standards:    - Only qualified researchers. The researcher must have credentials and be affiliated with a reputable non-profit institution.     - Only well-designed, socially-driven medical research. Research must be not for profit without conflicts of interest. Research is supported by current scientific understanding and aimed at improving health in humans.  ​​       We do NOT choose which topics of medical research are worthwhile. That is left up to you, our sponsors. Once a study is approved to be on the platform, the Research Lead supports the researcher and their team in preparing their profile. This includes helping convey clarity and understanding, selecting representative images and videos, and drafting of budget and grant. As soon as a study reaches its funding goal, sponsorship is closed. We will let you know when your study has been fully funded! Research Lead then works with the researchers, their institution, and lawyers to finalize the grant for funding the study. Once the grant is finalized, the research will begin receiving grant payments as the study reaches milestones outlined in the profile (timeline section). You have the option to receive email updates, so you can be alerted as your sponsored research progresses! Once the study is complete, researchers will share their findings with you through the platform.",,,,

We are involved in the following: 1) Skin Cancer Therapeutics : We are using human tissue constructs, animal cancer models, image & spectroscopic molecular analysis, and AI to discover, formulate & deliver compounds into tumors to treat human skin cancer. We are seeking a partner or investor to join with us to help move the R&D program into clinical phases of development. 2) Toxicology Screening Services: Another of our projects is the use of high-throughput in vitro biological assays in the area of developmental toxicology. Initial screens will involve the use of human umbilical cord- and placental- derived stem cells in vitro which may allow your company to decrease the use of animals and the costs incurred in developmental toxicology testing. 3) Oncology Drug Testing: We are also developing human in vitro 3-dimensional multicellular systems that mimic the tumor microenvironment that may be used in the pre-clinical phase of the development of drugs, biologics, and biosimilars. These 3-D tissue constructs, that contain multiple cell types that are found in the tumor microenvironment, therefore more closely represent the dynamic conditions that are exhibited in vivo in the tissues of human subjects than that which can be observed using 2-D tissue culture systems. 4) Please see our funding campaign at Gust.com or AngelList.com: https://gust.com/companies/superlative-biosciences-corporation/dashboard https://angel.co/company/superlative-biosciences-2 5) Superlative BioSciences Also Provides Consultation On: Biologics, Biosimilars, Pharmaceuticals, In Vitro Diagnotics, Cell & Tissue Therapy, Stem Cells, and Combination Devices Regulatory Guidance The Preparation of Quality Manuals & Other Quality Documents including Change Control, Deviations, CAPA, FMEA, Trending, and Complaint Handling, FDA/GLP, FDA/GTP, FDA/QSR, FDA/GMP, ICH, EMA, CE Marking & ISO Documents Management.
