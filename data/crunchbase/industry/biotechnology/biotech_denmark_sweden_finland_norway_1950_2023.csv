Simris,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/simris-alg,"Agriculture, Beauty, Biotechnology, Consumer Goods, Dietary Supplements, Lifestyle, Nutrition, Wellness","Hammenhög, Skane Lan, Sweden",Simris produces unique ingredients from farmed microalgae instead of fish and other marine animals.,"33,029",$10M to $50M,Active,2011-02-14,day,2016-04-13,day,,,For Profit,https://www.simris.com,"Simris is a multi-awarded pioneering agribusiness growing algae in Sweden. We save and protect endangered marine habitats, by producing unique ingredients from farmed microalgae instead of fish and other marine animals. Our goal is to be the beacon for positive change in business. We are based in Hammenhög, Österlen/greater Copenhagen, close to the sun and the sea. Simris is a pioneer in the development of microalgae as a novel crop and biotechnological production platform. We have developed an industrial process for growing microalgae to produce omega-3, as a vegan and superior alternative to fish oil and krill. We own the entire value chain from farm to bottle, i.e. from cultivation to finished product. We have recently started to develop further substances and ingredients from microalgae, to replace additional commodities from endangered marine species and ocean habitats at risk. Microalgae, or phytoplankton, are microscopically small aquatic plants. Just as land-based plants, microalgae grow by photosynthesis, where atmospheric carbon dioxide is converted to oxygen with the help of sunlight. Microalgae constitute the basis of the marine food chain, meaning that many nutrients that are crucial for human and animal health ultimately originate from microalgae. These substances eventually accumulate in higher marine organisms such as fish and seafood through the marine food chain. Many of these marine species are under the threat of extinction, due to overfishing and the destruction of marine habitats. Furthermore, marine commodities often contain high levels of mercury, PCB, PFAS and dioxins, due to toxic pollutants and plastics in the oceans. By sourcing marine commodities directly from microalgae instead of via fish or krill, we obtain better alternatives that are entirely plant-based and without the environmental toxins. In this way, the products are both safer for consumers, but also superior in terms of positive environmental impact. Cultivation of microalgae is a relatively novel technology at the intersection between biotechnology and precision aquaculture. The commercial potential is considered vast in a number of industries including food, pharma, skincare and advanced materials. However, commercial applications for modern microalgae technology are still limited, as most technology is yet at research stage or restricted to smaller development companies. Simris is one of the leading companies in the field and one of few companies globally that have succeeded to prove their technology at industrial scale and reached market phase for its products. Contrary to industry standard which uses yeast-like algae grown in closed tanks on sugar substrate, Simris uses photosynthetic algae for the production of omega-3. This process has positive climate effects through the conversion of carbon dioxide to oxygen. Also, Simris exclusively grows natural algae strains without genetic modifications that are common in conventional bioprocess engineering. Our first products are sold under the proprietary Simris® Algae Omega-3 consumer brand, targeted at the globally growing markets for wellness products and plant-based alternatives. The products are currently launched on the US market, including trendsetting retailers such as Goop and Erewhon Market. We also have a distribution agreement in South Korea, and retail agreements with Sweden’s major department store Åhléns and largest pharmacy chain Apoteket. Simris was one of the first publicly listed vegan companies, and has been listed on the Nasdaq First North Growth Market since 2016. We are still in development phase and aim to create long-term sustainable profit for our shareholders, in harmony with our society, our environment and the climate.",IPO,197370000,SEK,23517806

The application was to identify FCMB (Foetal Cells in Maternal Blood). The project discovered that conventional instruments such as flow cytometry and common fluorescent scanners were not good enough for this type of application could not detect the extremely rare fetal cells and could not offer features for molecular characterization. The CytoTrack technology was invented and developed specifically for the challenges of rare cell detection by Christian Caspersen.

The business model is to: SELECT the most commercially attractive medical innovations; DEVELOP innovations to the stage where the greatest return on investment can be achieved; and COMMERCIALIZE the innovations through the sale of companies or out-licensing of products. Karolinska Development has developed a well-structured selection process to identify the most commercially attractive medical innovations screened by KIAB. Pharmaceutical development is a high-risk enterprise. In most cases, development projects fail because of side effects or insufficient efficacy. Successful selection of innovations is fundamental to Karolinska Development’s business model, which makes the inflow of new projects crucial. One key to success lies in selecting those innovations that can be developed from scientific findings to products and have significant commercial potential. To date, over 1,300 projects have been screened by KIAB. The portfolio companies are often founded together with the innovators and are initially operated as virtual companies with few or no employees. During the first six to twelve months, the companies normally have minimal fixed costs and technological development is outsourced. The innovator, who is often employed at an academic institution, normally participates as a board member and scientific advisor. The CEO of a portfolio company cooperates closely with a representative of Karolinska Development, who in most cases is also a board member of the company. The companies are capitalized to reach their next milestone, usually within a period of six to eighteen months. Development projects are continuously monitored, and those that do not meet their stipulated targets are discontinued. In the first three to four years, a portfolio company’s operating expenses are often limited to a few million Swedish kronor per year, which cover the cost of external studies and the salary of the staff. In subsequent years, Karolinska Development and other investors play an important role recruiting key expertise to the companies Karolinska Development intends to realize value by exiting portfolio companies or through out-licensing of projects. Such transactions (especially out-licensing) are often structured as single upfront payments followed by payments based on predetermined milestones and royalties on sales. Although Karolinska Development has a flexible exit strategy, pharmaceutical products are, for two reasons, preferably exited at Phase II. First a successful Phase II study indicates that the pharmaceutical has an effect on patients, which is an important value-enhancing factor when negotiating out-licensing or sales. Secondly, finalizing product development and undertaking Phase III clinical trials frequently requires very large patient populations. In many cases this requires much greater resources than those available at Karolinska Development but these can be found in established pharmaceutical companies. Several licensing deals were closed in 2011 involving projects with a similar focus and development phase to Karolinska Development's projects.",IPO,,,

Adenium focuses on the development and commercialization of novel antibiotics for the treatment of multi drug resistant bacterial infections. Our  focus is treatment of nosocomial infections, in particular complicated urinary tract infections and hospital or ventilator acquired pneumonia caused by multi drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria.  Complicated urinary tract infections are caused by predominantly Gram-negative bacteria and in particular Escherichia coli. E. coli is also a frequent cause of many other common bacterial infections such as  cholecystitis, bacteremia, cholangitis and traveler’s diarrhea, as well as other clinical infections such as neonatal meningitis and pneumonia. Most Infections caused by Escherichia coli are relative easy to cure, however, hospital adapted strains of Escherichia coli are often multi-resistant and are able to cause life threatening infections. Hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP) or ventilator acquired pnemonia (VAP) are also indications dominated by Gram-negative bacteria and in particular Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. P. aeruginosa has become an important cause of infection, especially in patients with compromised host defense mechanisms. It is the most common pathogen isolated from patients who have been hospitalized longer than 1 week and it is a frequent cause of nosocomial infections such as pneumonia, UTIs, and bacteremia. Infections caused by Klebsiella and Pseudomonas are complicated since many Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains are multi drug resistant. Infections caused by Acinetobacter are rare and most strains found outside hospitals are sensitive to antibiotics. While Acinetobacter poses few risks to healthy individuals, a few species, particularly Acinetobacter baumannii, can cause serious infections – mainly in very ill trauma and hospitalized patients increasing the post trauma mortality as seen in wounded soldiers in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The most common Acinetobacter infections include pneumonia, bacteraemia, wound infections, and urinary tract infections. ‘Hospital-adapted’ strains of Acinetobacter are often resistant to antibiotics and are increasingly difficult to treat. Adenium Biotech strives to find a novel treatment for multi-resistant Acinetobacter. Arenicin is a non haemolytic and non cytotoxic 21 amino acids antimicrobial peptide isolated from the lugworm. Arenicin has a strong and selective efficacy against Gram negative bacteria as well as a broad therapeutic window. Ten Arenicin variants were selected and subjected to a ranking program consisting of toxicology as well as in vitro and in vivo efficacy profiling. The three highest ranking Arenicin variants were selected in December 2013 for final lead optimization and selection of an Arenicin lead product candidate early in the fourth quarter 2013.

Arfolitixorin is a new drug candidate that Isofol is primarily developing to treat colorectal cancer (CRC) – the third most common type of cancer and one for which there is a substantial need for more effective drugs. Isofol’s development work with arfolitixorin is also targeting so-called “rescue therapy” after high-dose chemotherapy with methotrexate in conjunction with osteosarcoma (bone cancer). Other potential uses for arfolitixorin also includes the treatment of pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, stomach cancer, and head and neck cancers. When treating colorectal cancer, arfolitixorin is administered in combination with the cytotoxic agent, 5-FU (5-fluorouracil), in order to improve tumour size reduction and extend the life of the cancer patient. The active substance in arfolitixorin is MTHF ([6R]-5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate). The folate-based prodrugs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin, are currently used in combination with the cytotoxic agent, 5-FU, in the treatment of colorectal cancer. Isofol intends to replace leucovorin and levoleucovorin with arfolitixorin, with the primary aim of improving the treatment for over 365,000 colorectal cancer patients in the USA, Europe and Japan. Unlike leucovorin and levoleucovorin, which must be metabolised into MTHF in the body in order to be effective in the treatment of cancer, arfolitixorin’s active substance is MTHF, which means that no metabolic activation is required and arfolitixorin consequently has the potential to achieve a more powerful antitumoural effect for all patients in combination with 5-FU treatment. Thanks to a global licensing agreement with Merck KGaA, Germany, Isofol has gained the exclusive right to develop and commercialise arfolitixorin in the field of oncology. The licensing agreement with Merck also gives Isofol access to the unique, patented MTHF/arfolitixorin manufacturing process.

At the core of the companys development program is proprietary chemistry modifications of widely prescribed anti-bacterials to yield more efficacious and safer antibiotics. Our ambition is to develop best in class anti-infective drugs in the macrolide family, positioned for first-line monotherapy of community acquired bacterial pneumonia in community- and hospitalized patients.  Despite the critical need for more effective antibiotics to combat drug-resistant ‘super-bugs’ the pipeline of new antibiotics under development is alarmingly slim. Our ambition is to add to this pipeline through innovative, targeted and effective drug development. Our technological core is innovative chemistry on complex molecules in the macrolide/ketolide class. This class remain the second largest group of antibiotics, measured in sales, more than 50 years after the first macrolide (erythromycin) was introduced in the market. Following the introduction of erythromycin, substantial research has been conducted on the molecule and a number of semi-synthetic erythromycin-derivatives have been introduced to the market, resulting in derivatives with improved spectrum, potency, pharmacokinetic and pharmakodynamic properties. However, bacterial resistance to existing macrolides is rapidly spreading. Through innovative and patent protected chemistry C10 Pharma has been able to open up a part of the molecule that has previously not been accessible to semi-synthetic modifications. Early stage biological testing has provided strong support that such modifications can result in new molecules with highly attractive properties, including activity against ‘super-bugs’ like MRSA.
