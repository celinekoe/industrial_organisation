Long waits at the doctor, constant anxiety, and system-crushing antibiotic cycles Jenna had tried all of the usual recommendations (proper hygiene, ineffective cranberry products, even low-level antibiotics) and was starting to feel stuck.

Built in collaboration with physicians and urologists and with the best clinical research available, Uqora was launched in 2017. The current suite of products includes three flagship products: Uqora Target, Uqora Control, and Uqora Promote. Each product holds a distinct function to flush the urinary tract, cleanse biofilm, and balance the vaginal microbiome (respectively). All products are manufactured in the USA and are formulated with ingredients found in nature.   Since its inception, Uqora has helped more than 75,000 people find a path to better urinary tract health. With over 5,000 five-star reviews, Uqora users frequently say that with Uqora, they’ve ‘gotten their life back’ and find Uqora’s products to be ’life-changing.""

We are the first company in the world to launch a complete line of HMO products for adults and have been recommended by Ben Greenfield Fitness.  PureHMO® prebiotic line is developed to optimize people’s gut microbiome - boost the key bacteria, increase microbial diversity, and address various gut-related issues (IBS, SIBO, leaky gut etc). PureHMO® line is centered around a core ingredient: human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) – an ingredient that is only available in recent years. This is the only prebiotic for infants to build a healthy gut microbiome from scratch. The traditional prebiotics galactooligosaccharide (GOS), Fructooligosaccharide (FOS), were added to infant formula only to simulate the functions of HMO, which also include immune modulation and cognitive support.  Unlike traditional solutions of using probiotic to address gut health problems, our concept is to use PureHMO® to feed the bacteria existed in the gut, strategically boost their growth, and build an optimized microbiome. More science has shown that probiotic supplements only solve problems temporally and cannot improve the long-term microbiome composition, which can only be tuned by diet - the food for gut bacteria.  Compared to traditional GOS and FOS prebiotics, HMO is new, has unique structures and more functions that makes HMO more attractive to consumers. HMO is a selective food for key gut probiotics - Bifidobacteria and Akkermansia. HMO directly fights with pathogens. HMO also provides fuel for cognitive functions. Our goal is to build a complete line of HMO products to address various gut-related health problems, with different product forms and flavors.

Uniquely, Renew’s scaffold molecules pass the blood brain barrier and engage a classic cellular receptor that controls inflammation (i.e. PPAPγ), together making this family of molecules particularly useful for indications of neuro-therapeutics.

In 1986, Dr. Carol Janerette discovered and invented inoculants from ectomycorrhizal fungi that formed  endomycorrhizal fungus infections with non-woody plants and ectomycorrhizal fungus infections with  woody plants. "" Being able to get one of these fungi that normally forms this relationship with woody  plants to infect non-woody plants is an unexpected and unique observation.”  Plants cultivated with Dr. J's Fungi consistently achieve ""super-sized"" yield increases and fewer cases of life-threatening diseases without harming the environment.

Current diagnostics only measure a more generalized lean mass or body fat, neither of which true indicators of strength and health, especially in the body compositions of young children. Yet, there does not exist an accurate way to measure direct skeletal muscle mass in any capacity. Flexaya is the first-to-market in offering a commercially available diagnostic to directly measure muscle mass. Using unique features of muscle tissue and creatine biology, Flexaya provides a simple, affordable approach to measure muscle mass, one that can be repeated at home through a subscription-based service model, all without the need for access to specialized equipment. We have validated this measure against the gold standard (MRI) with greater than 98% accuracy rate in both adults and children (see Clark J Appl Physiol 1985). At our respective academic institutions, we have implemented in this measure in a large, $1.5m NIH-funded study of more than 1400 older men, as well as in a large study of more than 100 infants and children with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The extensions of Flexaya’s testing method are vast, as studies underway indicate that muscle mass is perhaps the most sensitive metric to track growth stunting due to malnutrition, a global epidemic affecting nearly one-in-four children worldwide. As skeletal muscle is the largest organ in the body for glucose disposal, our measure may also have applications in diabetic research.  Flexaya’s method may well evolve as the standard diagnostic in what is an increasing appetite for self-diagnostic health and fitness data by the mass-market adult consumer, as well as become the defacto test for pediatricians and neonatologists to determine the trajectory of growth of infants and children.",,,,
