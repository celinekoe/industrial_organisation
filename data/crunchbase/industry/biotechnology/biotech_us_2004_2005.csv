The company has developed diagnostic kits for breast, colon, ovarian, and prostate cancers, and markets diagnostic kits in Europe for the detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in patients with breast and colon cancer. Product and Product Candidate Pipeline The company's portfolio of compounds and technologies under development or planned development include: AdnaGen Oncology Diagnostics; A Liposomal TS Inhibitor; Cordycepin; L-Nucleoside Conjugates; and Novel Tubulin Isotype-Specific Anti-Mitotics. AdnaGen Diagnostic Products The company's subsidiary, AdnaGen A.G., offers diagnostic products for colon and breast cancer diagnosis in the European market. It has the ability to detect and recognize the expression of tumor-associated biomarkers in patients with metastatic cancer. In September 2008, AdnaGen entered into a distribution and license agreement with Biomarkers LLC (Biomarkers) granting Biomarkers the right to distribute the AdnaGen diagnostic kits in North America. AdnaGen also entered into a distribution and license agreement with Biomarkers granting Biomarkers the right to distribute the AdnaGen diagnostic kits in South America and the Middle East.

Liposomal Thymidylate Synthase (TS) Inhibitor (OVI-237) (solid tumors) OVI-237 is the company's advanced clinical stage drug. OVI-237 is a liposome encapsulated formulation of a potent thymidylate synthase inhibitor (TSI) with activity at picomolar concentrations. It was obtained as a result of a worldwide licensing agreement with OSI Pharmaceuticals (Melville, New York). With OVI-237, it has finalized the protocol and selected clinical sites to conduct a Phase II Study of OVI-237 monotherapy and combination therapy with cisplatin for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Cordycepin (OVI-123) (TdT-Positive Refractory Leukemias) The company is developing Cordycepin as a treatment option for certain leukemia patients that are either refractory to chemotherapeutics or have experienced a relapse. Cordycepin depends upon the presence of a DNA polymerase, known as terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), for its therapeutic activity. Cordycepin has been studied in a National Cancer Institute-sponsored Phase I clinical trial for treating TdT-positive ALL leukemia patients. It initiated a Phase I/II trial based on the â€˜original' ADA-sensitive compound. L-Nucleoside Conjugate (OVI-117): The company has accumulated in vitro and in vivo data indicating that the L-nucleoside conjugates are effective against various types of cancer. One of its L-nucleoside conjugate candidates, OVI-117, is a conjugate of an L-nucleoside (L-uridine) and the highly toxic compound 5'-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP), a thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitor. Tubulin Isotype-Specific Anti-mitotics The company's other platform technology relates to a proprietary database of tubulin isotypes as potential candidates for targeting by certain chemotherapeutics. It is evaluating various candidates as part of its research and development in this area.

The company's main focus is the development of NVX-207, a novel, topical drug candidate with the potential to revolutionize how actinic keratosis (AK) is being treated in the absence of inflammation. AK is a pre-cancerous skin condition resulting from prolonged sun exposure and is one of the the skin diseases most frequently diagnosed by US dermatologists, affecting more than 60 million Americans. In Australia, for instance, AK affects about half the population over age 50. While the overall AK market is estimated at over $2 billion in the US alone, topical therapy is used in only about 25% of patients due to limited activity (complete clearance of lesions in only about half the patients) and often severe side effects of available topical products. In spite of these deficiencies, the AK market for topical products in the US alone exceeded $450 million in 2009 growing at 22% per annum. NVX-207's patent position is strong, development timelines to human proof of concept in AK patients are short and interest in the opportunity at the proof of concept level is clear. A recent transaction demonstrates the interest in new therapies in AK markets - LEO Pharma of Denmark acquired Peplin for $287.5 million in cash to gain access to PEP005, a natural product, without composition of matter patent protection and average to low activity, in late stage development for AK.
