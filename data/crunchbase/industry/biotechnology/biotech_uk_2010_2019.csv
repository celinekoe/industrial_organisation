The molecules have two distinct parts: one end binds a cell-surface target on the pathogen using an aptamer whereas the other end presents specific epitopes that attach to the circulating antibodies. It has been demonstrated that Alphamers have the potential to redirect pre-existing antibodies to bacteria in a specific manner and trigger an immediate antibacterial immune response, so clearing the infection.  Centauri Therapeutics’ strategy is to redirect naturally occurring antibodies to target disease. Centauri Therapeutics' unique Chemistry Platform provides a flexible scaffold to enable the synthesis of specific Alphamers.

For patients with the most common primary brain tumour, glioblastoma, there has been a severe lack of new, effective treatments for decades, with only a handful of approved options. Because of this, glioblastoma has some of the worst outcomes of any cancer, with a 5-year survival rate of <5.  Co-founder and academic neurosurgeon Dr Richard Fu recognised this and was frustrated not only by the lack of treatments available for patients but also by major design flaws in newer electric field therapy approaches. Working together with Dr Chris Bullock, a biomedical engineer who had been carrying out research at Manchester's world-class materials research centres, they formed an elegant solution designed to optimise patient life-expectancy and quality of life.  QV Bioelectronics was founded to their solution GRACE, to patients.

Exonate’s lead programme is focused on Diabetic Macular Oedema (DMO). A consequence of diabetic retinopathy, DMO, is swelling in an area of the retina called the macula and wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration (wAMD), which is the leading cause of vision loss in people aged 60 and older.  The Company is founded on scientific excellence with strong links to Professor David Bates and his lab at Nottingham University specializing in the biology and biochemical pathways of VEGF splice variants. Exonate have developed small molecules that inhibit production of pro-angiogenic VEGF through selective inhibition of serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (SRPK1)-mediated VEGF splicing.  These inhibitors have already demonstrated superior efficacy as topical agents in preclinical models of wet AMD.  Through a Wellcome Trust funded project, Exonate has completed an optimization programme and has nominated a pre-clinical candidate drug with optimal characteristics. During the second quarter of 2020 regulatory toxicology and safety pharmacology studies have taken place. This is to support the successful application to the regulatory authorities for clinical evaluation.   Exonate is led by an experienced, international management team that has previously worked together with cross-disciplinary experience in medicine and drug development, as well as successful fundraising for early stage companies. About Diabetic Macular Oedema (DMO)*: DMO is the build-up of fluid (Oedema) in a region of the retina called the macula. The macula is important for the sharp, straight-ahead vision that is used for reading, recognizing faces, and driving. DMO is the most common cause of vision loss among people with diabetic retinopathy. About half of all people with diabetic retinopathy will develop DMO and although it is more likely to occur as diabetic retinopathy worsens, DMO can happen at any stage of the disease. About wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration (wet AMD): Today, wet AMD is a leading cause of vision loss in people aged 60 years or older and affects more than 30 million patients worldwide, over 200,000 of those in the UK alone. If untreated patients are likely to lose sight in the affected eye within 24 months of disease onset. The main currently available treatment options for DMO and wet AMD are: •	anti-VEGF antibody drugs – to prevent the growth of new blood vessels in the eye. Unlike small molecule drugs or eye drops these treatments must be injected into the eye once every 1 or 2 months. Resistance can develop to these drugs causing the disease to progress anew. •	Laser surgery – to destroy abnormal blood vessels in the eye. This type of surgery is only suitable if blood vessel damage is not too extensive and if the abnormal blood vessels aren't close to the fovea, as performing surgery close to this part of the eye can cause permanent vision loss. •	With DMO, Corticosteroids either injected or implanted into the eye, may be used alone or in combination with other drugs or laser surgery to treat DMO. *source: https://nei.nih.gov/health/diabetic/retinopathy",Early Stage Venture,9100000,GBP,11730295

Their KYnergy technology uses the textile Celliant to recycle the body's waste energy back for the benefit of the wearer, to enhance performance and accelerate recovery processes. They designed and engineered their specialist sportswear to work harder for you, so you can perform at your MAXIMUM potential. KYMIRA Sport products have been designed specifically with the purpose of enhancing performance and accelerating recovery. With their inbuilt KYnergy infrared technology embedded within the fibres of their fabrics, your body gains from the following responses that occur when you are exposed to infrared. click on the PROVEN benefits below to find out exactly how the magic happens! Using their KYnergy infrared technology causes an increase in a molecule called Nitric Oxide (NO) which is a vasodilator. This means that NO causes your blood vessels to expand, allowing more blood to pass through them  Putting it simply, using their KYnergy infrared technology means that your muscles have more fuel available and work more efficiently. Breaking this down, because your circulation is increased, more oxygen is delivered to the muscle cells (more fuel).   There isn't a simple way to explain this, but in short: when you use KYMIRA kit, the infrared causes NO to dissociate from the active site of one of the enzyme Cytochrome-C Oxidase which is part of the energy production process within your cells. Because the active site is free, the metabolic processes within your cells occur quicker resulting in a number of further responses: increased energy (ATP) production and cells grow, repair & replicate quicker. Finally studies have found that using their technology will alleviate pain because as well as acting as a vasodilator, NO also reacts with a molecule called cyclic Guanosine Monophosphate (cGMP) which then mediates a pain relief response. The NO & cGMP reaction is actually the same way that taking an opiate like morphine works, but infrared is a lot less potent.",Seed,394657,GBP,539780
