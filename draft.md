### Introduction
>By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internetâ€™s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine's. - Paul Krugman, Why most economists' predictions are wrong (1998)[1]

What distinguishes real innovation from a technological fad? What separates Amazon from Pets.com, Novo Nordisk from Theranos, SpaceX from Concorde[2]? We might guarantee the rightness of our prediction by stating, innovation which suceeds is an innovation, and innovation which fails is a fad. But if failure is the distinguishing factor, how do we explain the Internet after the Dot Com Bubble, solar power after Solyndra, or OpenAI after the AI winter[3]? We might imagine that it is impossible to determine whether an innovation would succeed or fail until it does, thus we defer investment to the market, and avoid the pretense of knowledge[4]. But who is the market? Is the market the fresh-faced MBA, who with confident humility states that the market is efficient and therefore they should defer to the market[5]? Then who is the market?

The COVID-19 pandemic[6], Russia's invasion of Ukraine[7], and increasing US-China hostilities[8] have contributed to the weakening of the free trade consensus already weakened by the decline of US manufacturing[10], the Great Financial Crisis[11], and perceived market ineffectiveness at addressing climate change[12]. In it's place is an emerging consensus[13] on the importance of industrial policy[14] to national development, resulting in the passage of the CHIPS Act and Inflation Reduction Act. But the problem remains. How much should be invested where? Whether it's lowly manager of a rusting automobile plant in Detroit, or an academic polishing their spectacles in a high tower, someone must decide. Do we (...)[15]. Do we invest generously, trusting blindly that all scientific progress leads to equal societal progress? When the particle physicists ask for $3 billion for a new particle collider[16], do we still hold that blind faith [17]?

The fundamental theorem of economics is that resources are scarce. Thus it is the job of economists to determine how to allocate scarce resources. Resources invested into Uber and WeWork[16], skimmed off by (...) and expensed on the consumption of luxuries, are resources not invested into the real innovation that makes economies grow[17]. Not only money, time, talent (...)[18].

This paper attempts to address some broad questions about investment across industries and actors using Crunchbase company, investor, and funding round data:

Research Funding
- Has private research funding changed over time?
- Has public research funding changed over time?

Education
- Have there been less STEM graduates, relative to (...)?
- Have there been less STEM doctorates, relative to (...)?

Private Investors
- Who are the largest private investors?
- Where are the largest private investments?
- Have private investments changed over time?
- Are different investor types different?

Public Investors
- Who are the largest private investors?
- Where are the largest public investments?
- Have public investments changed over time?
- Are public investments different from private investment?
- Does public investment lead or lag private investment?

Investment Patterns
- What are some patterns of investment? e.g. Constant, peak, slow peak, fast peak, multiple peaks, decline
- Are sharp increases in investment associated with sharp crashes?

Recessions
- Are firms founded inside recessions different from firms started outside recessions?

### Data
Company, investor, and funding data was obtained from Crunchbase. Macroeconomic data has been sourced from CEIC. The company dataset of represents all (...) US companies available from Crunchbase, then filtered to only include for-profit companies founded between 1960 and 2019. Where the founding date was not available, I supplemented the data with the date of the domain registration from WHOIS. The start year was chosen as the earliest 'round' year where all macroeconomic data was available. The end year was chosen slightly arbitrarily due to suspected data truncation issues - past 2019, the number of companies founded dropped too sharply to be due to market conditions. The classification of industries and "industry groups" (Groups of related industries, e.g. Biotechnology and Genetics are in the same industry group) was also obtained from Crunchbase. The investor and funding data set represents all investors and funding rounds available from Crunchbase.

The following are the columns used for analysis:

Company
- Company Name
- Founded Year
- Industry Group
- Industry
- Top 5 Investors

Investor
- Investor Name
- Investor Type

Funding
(...)

Macroeconomic:
- Real GDP
- Read GDP Growth Rate
- Interest Rate

The following are the industry groups used for analysis

Industry Groups
- Artificial Intelligence
- Biotechnology
- Sustainability
- Blockchain and Cryptocurrency
- Science and Engineering
- Administrative Services
- Financial Services
- Manufacturing

I chose the above industry groups to represent a range of "hyped" technologies from my personal experience (Artificial Intelligence, Biotechnology, Sustainability, Blockchain and Cryptocurrency), as well as the broad sectors of the US economy (Engineering, Administrative and Financial Services, Manufacturing). The industries included in the industry groups may preclude industries which should logically be included e.g. Pharmaceuticals is not included in Biotechnology. Thus I may supplement analysis of these industry groups with other industries where it is sensible. I also chose the above industry groups to partition companies into groups which are conceptually coherent e.g. I used Biotechnology instead of Health Care since Health Care includes industries which are more service-oriented like Nursing and Residential Care.
