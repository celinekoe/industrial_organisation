Download us research data
Plot science v nonscience
Nice stack chart
Can call it a day here
Focus on other stuff tomorrow
The remainder is just to do a bunch of regressions

science vs research data time series
Get percentages for us
Just see the graph of what's on top changing over time
Might want to use log?
I think I can just do the plotting for now
Get investor data later

figure out how to make sense of this mess of data
I still haven't figured out how to classify hard soft
copy down crunchbase categories and groups
download more data - industrial groups, us, singapore, asean
well, first I should figure out what I want to do with the data I already have
The problem with the data is everything is shooting up
lets do basic regressions
log count vs log gdp + log fed rate 
I want to see the coefficient on the fed rate
Then can do country by country regression
I want to classify by hard soft (but what do I want to do with that?) - big breaks
I want to get rnd data from us gov
and track that against the different categories, see if there is any pattern there
I want to see closure rates
I want to get gdp data and check growth rates
I can get investor data for the public side
