A rolling window average of $\beta_{i,t}$ with a three period lookback was then used to smooth the data. Without the smoothing, there was no apparent change in $\beta_{i,t}$ in either firm founding or funding rounds over time, even though there was a visually apparent change in the peak heights in a plot of $\beta_{i,t}$ over time. This might be due to the averaging together of hype periods (where there is an observed change) with non-hype periods (where there is no observed change). In theory, a rolling window average should not result distort underlying pattern if the underlying pattern has not changed, though the use of two manipulations in calculating $\beta_{i,t}$ and then calculating its rolling average is still not ideal. Some alternatives to this approach will be discussed in the Limitations section.
